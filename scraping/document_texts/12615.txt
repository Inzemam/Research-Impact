Ensuring the Integrity, Accessibility, and Stewardship of Research Data in the Digital AgeCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preface
Data are the foundation on which scienti˜c, engineering, and medical 
knowledge is built. The generation, analysis, communication, and preservation 
of data are in a period of profound change, and research is being similarly 
transformed.
The development and rapid advance of digital technologies have enabled 
immense quantities of data to be created, processed, and disseminated around 
the world. These data can capture the characteristics of phenomena in far 
greater detail and with a dynamic verisimilitude never before possible. Data 
from different ˜elds are being combined, yielding deep insights into formerly 
intractable problems. The open sharing of data, tools, and services over the 
Internet is creating new ways of carrying out research and new relationships 
among researchers. New research topics and ˜elds are emerging between the 
boundaries of traditional disciplines, and the questions that investigators can 
address are rapidly expanding.
These changes in the nature and conduct of research are greatly enhancing 
the capabilities of researchers. However, these changes also are posing chal
-lenges, and in some cases they have had negative consequences. A major
 impetus 
for this study was a letter sent from the editors of several leading
 journals to 
National Academy of Sciences President Ralph Cicerone (see Appendix C) 
pointing out that the improper manipulation of digital images submitted to 
scholarly journals has become a signi˜cant issue for editors and publishers. 
More broadly, changes in the use of research data have raised the stakes for the 
methods traditionally used to ensure the integrity and utility of data. Research 
data and results are increasingly critical inputs to a widening variety of policy 
debates and decisions. Transparency on the part of investigators with regard to 
the collection of data, methods of analysis, and presentation of results is essential 
for the research enterprise to serve the public as an objective source of unbiased

information. In that regard, another major impetus for this report was the recent 
controversy over the interpretation and use of data to reconstruct historical 
changes in global temperatures. In this case, the combination of an important 
policy topic, differences in data-sharing expectations between ˜elds, and unclear 
expectations among researchers and members of the public opened researchers 
to heightened scrutiny, skepticism, and even harassment.
As plans for this study took shape, it became clear that the issues involving 
research data extend well beyond the most immediate connotations of the term 
ﬁdata integrity.ﬂ Thus, the charge issued to our committee asked us to look at 
several critical issues:
An ad hoc committee will conduct a study of issues that have arisen from 
the evolution of practices in the collection, processing, oversight, publishing, 
ownership, accessing, and archiving of research data. The key questions to be 
addressed are:
1. 
 What are the growing varieties of research data? In addition to issues 
concerned with the direct products of research, what issues are involved in 
the treatment of raw data, prepublication data, materials, algorithms, and 
computer codes?
2. 
 Who owns research data, particularly that which results from federally 
funded research? Is it the public? The research institution? The lab? The 
researcher?
3. 
 To what extent is a scientist responsible for supplying research data to 
other scientists (including those who seek to reproduce the research) and to 
other parties who request them? Is a scientist responsible for supplying data, 
algorithms, and computer codes to other scientists who request them?
4. 
 What challenges do the science and technology community face
 arising 
from actions that would compromise the integrity of research data? What 
steps should be taken by the science and technology community, research 
institutions, journal publishers, and funders of research in response to these 
challenges?
5. 
 What are the current standards for accessing and maintaining research 
data, and how should these evolve in the future? How might such standards 
differ for federally funded and privately funded research, and for research 
conducted in academia, government, nongovernmental organizations, and 
industry?
The study will not address privacy issues and other issues related to 
human subjects.
At our committee™s ˜rst meeting, it quickly became apparent that even 
this wide-ranging charge did not encompass the full range of pressing issues

xi
involving research data. Digital technologies have been changing research at a 
pace that would have been hard to predict even a decade ago. Practices and 
expectations for data sharing vary considerably from ˜eld to ˜eld and are 
rapidly evolving. National and homeland security concerns affect the policy 
environment governing access to various types of data. In some areas the costs 
of maintaining collections and transferring them to new digital media raise 
questions about who is responsible for undertaking and ˜nancing long-term 
stewardship. A growing variety of investigators and research ˜elds face dif˜cult 
choices involving trade-offs between sustaining existing data collections and 
performing new research.
The purpose of this report is to explore the evolving roles and responsibili
-ties of researchers, research institutions, research sponsors, journals, publishers, 
and others in generating, analyzing, disseminating, and preserving research 
data. Many of the methods used to validate the quality of data, make data 
available to other researchers, and preserve data for future uses are unique to 
speci˜c disciplines. Focusing on these discipline-speci˜c methods would yield 
a report that is both too narrow and too transitory given the transformative 
in˚uence of rapidly changing technologies.
Instead, we decided to base our report on the broad principles that have 
characterized science and engineering research for hundreds of years and will 
continue to do so in the future. In particular, we decided to focus on three 
broad and intertwined issues that we have characterized as integrity, access, and 
stewardship. For each of these issues, we state a general principle that applies 
throughout the research enterprise. We then use these three broad principles to 
formulate recommendations that apply in more speci˜c circumstances. We have 
also highlighted, within the text and in sidebars in each chapter, useful efforts 
by researchers, institutions, research ˜elds, research sponsors, professional 
societies, and journals to facilitate the realization of our broad objectives. And 
we have identi˜ed issuesŠsome new and some oldŠthat will need continued 
attention as technology continues to reshape the research enterprise.
Although this report addresses all of the components of the research enter
-prise, its primary focus is on the roles and responsibilities of the investigator. 
This is appropriate, given the composition of the committee and the nature of 
the task. The actions of researchers inevitably in˚uence all the other parts of 
the research enterprise, and each of these parts also has responsibilities in main
-taining the integrity, accessibility, and stewardship of research data. However, 
researchers must take the lead in addressing new and pressing issues involving 
research data. In general, the report attempts to re˚ect the perspectives of indi
-vidual researchers in different ˜elds with respect to the generation, preserva
-tion, and sharing of research data in science as a whole and in speci˜c ˜elds.
Following the Executive Summary, Chapter 1 introduces the main issues 
covered in the report by examining the terms used in the report and the vari
-eties of research data. Chapter 2, on the integrity of research data, looks at 
Ensuring the Integrity, Accessibility, and Stewardship of Research Data in the Digital AgeCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.xii
 PREFACE
the challenges to data integrity created by rapidly changing technologies and 
at responses to those challenges. Chapter 3 discusses the responsibility for 
researchers to make publicly available the data on which research results are 
based, and the variety of challenges this poses in different ˜elds and settings. 
And Chapter 4 describes the long-term value of research data and methods to 
preserve data for future uses.
The changes in the daily practices and activities of researchers due to the 
rapidly changing technologies provide a unique opportunity to reinforce and 
extend the traditional openness and collaborative nature of science.
In preparing this report, our committee has taken advantage of a number 
of studies by the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of 
Engineering, the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council. 
Appendix B provides a list of recent reports on relevant subjects. For example, 
the committee spent some time reviewing and discussing a recent controversy 
over the interpretation and use of data to reconstruct historical changes in 
global temperatures, as described in the 2006 NRC report 
Surface
 Temperature
 Reconstruction
 for
 the
 Last
 2,000
 Years.
 The importance of data in research and in societal decisions will continue 
to increase as science and engineering exert an ever greater in˚uence on society 
and as digital technologies continue to remake our world. The committee and 
the members of the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy 
hope and trust that this report will stimulate further dialogue to strengthen 
science and engineering in a data-rich world.

Ensuring the Integrity, Accessibility, and Stewardship of Research Data in the Digital AgeCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Advances in digital computing, communications, sensors, and storage tech
-nologies are revolutionizing nearly every area of scienti˜c, engineering, and 
medical research. Today, researchers are employing sophisticated technologies 
to generate, analyze, and share data to address questions that were unapproach
-able just a few years ago. They are carrying out detailed simulations to guide 
theoretical approaches and to validate new experimental approaches. They are 
working in interdisciplinary and often international teams on complex inte
-grative problems that require inputs from a multitude of perspectives. They 
are using data generated by others to augment their own data and sometimes 
to address problems that the original researchers could not have envisioned. 
Digital technologies have fostered a new world of research characterized by 
immense datasets, unprecedented levels of openness among researchers, and 
new connections among researchers, policy makers, and the public.
Even as these new capabilities are expanding the power and reach of 
research, they are raising complex issues for researchers, research institutions, 
research sponsors, professional societies, and journals. Digital technologies can 
complicate the process of verifying the accuracy and validity of research data, 
in part because of the enormous rate at which data can be generated and the 
intricate processing those data undergo. The high rate of innovation in digital 
technologies, a lack of standards, and issues such as privacy, national security, 
and possible commercial interests can inhibit the sharing of data, which can 
reduce the ability of researchers to verify results and build on previous research. 
Huge increases in the quantity of data being generated, combined with the need 
to move digital data between successive storage media and software environ
-ments as technologies evolve, are creating severe challenges in preserving data 
for long-term use. And these issues are not restricted to large-scale research

projects; they can be especially acute for the small-scale projects that continue 
to constitute the bulk of the research enterprise.
This report examines the consequences of the changes affecting research 
data with respect to three issues: integrity, accessibility, and stewardship. 
Because of the enormous range in the detailed procedures and styles of research 
from ˜eld to ˜eld, it is impossible to formulate speci˜c recommendations for 
every ˜eld. Instead, for each of the three issues examined in this report, the 
authoring committee has developed a fundamental principle that applies in all 
˜elds of research regardless of the pace or nature of technological change. The 
report then explores the implications of these three central principles for the 
various components of the research enterprise.
1 Developing the policies, standards, and infrastructure needed to ensure 
the integrity, accessibility, and stewardship of research data is a critically impor
-tant task. It will require sustained effort on the part of all stakeholders in the 
research enterprise. The committee believes that the broad principles stated in 
this report provide the appropriate framework for this undertaking.
ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF RESEARCH DATA
The ˜elds of science, engineering, and medicine span the totality of physi
-cal, biological, and social phenomena. Research in all these ˜elds is based on 
certain fundamental procedures and convictions. However, each research ˜eld 
has its own characteristic methods and scienti˜c style. Consequently, research 
is too broad an enterprise to permit many generalizations about its conduct.
One theme, however, threads through its many ˜elds: the primacy of scrupu
-lously recorded data. Because the techniques that researchers employ to ensure 
the integrityŠthe truth and accuracyŠof their data are as varied as the ˜elds 
themselves, there are no universal procedures for achieving technical accuracy. 
The term ﬁintegrity of dataﬂ also has a structural meaning, related to the data™s 
preservation and presentation. This is the subject of Chapter 4. There are, how
-ever, broadly accepted practices for generating and analyzing research. In most 
˜elds, for instance, experimental observations must be shown to be reproducible 
in order to be credible. Even this fundamental principle can have exceptions. 
For instance, observations with an historical element, such as the explosion of a 
supernova or the growth of an epidemic, cannot be reproduced. Other general 
practices include checking and rechecking data to con˜rm their accuracy and 
validity and submitting data and research results to peer review to ensure that 
the interpretation is valid. In addition, some practices may be employed only 
within speci˜c ˜elds, such as the use of double-blind clinical trials.
Many of the traditional methods for ensuring the integrity of dataŠwhether 
universal or discipline speci˜cŠare being modi˜ed as digital technologies alter

3capabilities and procedures. Because of the huge quantities of data generated 
by digital technologies, an increasing fraction of the processing and commu
-nication of data is done by computers, sometimes with relatively little human 
oversight. If this processing is ˚awed or misunderstood, the conclusions can be 
erroneous. Documenting work ˚ows, instruments, procedures, and measure
-ments so that others can fully understand the context of data is a vital task, but 
this can be dif˜cult and time-consuming. Furthermore, digital technologies 
can tempt those who are unaware of or dismissive of accepted practices in a 
particular research ˜eld to manipulate data inappropriately.
Several recent incidents and trends provided an impetus for this study, such 
as the challenge journals face in preventing inappropriate manipulation of digi
-tal images in submitted papers and well-publicized, albeit rare, cases of research 
misconduct involving fabricated or manipulated data. Assessing the broad set 
of institutions, policies, and practices that have been put into place to prevent 
and detect research misconduct, including the fabrication or inappropriate 
manipulation of data, was beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, the 
committee recognizes that the advance of digital technologies presents special 
challenges to the individuals and institutions charged with ensuring responsible 
conduct in research. Since these individuals and institutions will continue to 
play a critical role in ensuring the integrity of research data, it is important that 
they adapt their procedures in order to function effectively in the digital age.
The most effective method for ensuring the integrity of research data is to 
ensure high standards for openness and transparency. To the extent that data 
and other information integral to research results are provided to other experts, 
errors in data collection, analysis, and interpretation (intentional or uninten
-tional) can be discovered and corrected. This requires that the methods and 
tools used to generate and manipulate the data be available to peers who have 
the background to understand that information.
The traditional way for submitting data and results to the scrutiny of 
other researchers is through peer review, which allows the validity of data and 
results to be judged for quality by a research community before dissemina
-tion. Although traditional peer review practices remain essential for evaluating 
the importance and validity of research, it has become clear that these have 
limitations when it comes to ensuring that digital data have been appropriately 
collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Fortunately, it has also become clear that 
the advance of digital technologies is providing new opportunities to ensure 
data integrity through greater openness and transparency. The emergence and 
growth of accessible databases such as GenBank and the Sloan Digital Sky 
 
Survey illustrate these opportunities in widely disparate disciplines.

many ˜elds, a lack of technological infrastructure, cultural norms and expecta
-tions, and other factors act as barriers to openness and transparency.
The integrity of data in a time of revolutionary changes in research practice 
is too important to be taken for granted. Consequently, this
 report af˜rms the 
following general principle for ensuring the integrity of research data:
Data Integrity Principle: Ensuring the integrity of research data is essential for 
advancing scienti˜c, engineering, and medical knowledge and for maintaining 
public trust in the research enterprise. Although other stakeholders in the 
research enterprise have important roles to play, researchers themselves are 
ultimately responsible for ensuring the integrity of research data
.This straightforward principle leads to several speci˜c recommendations.
Recommendation
 1
: Researchers
 should
 design
 and
 manage
 their
 projects
 so
 as
 to
 ensure
 the
 integrity
 of
 research
 data,
 adhering
 to

 professional
 standards
 that
 distinguish
 scienti˜c,
 engineering,
 and
 medical
 research
 both
 as
 a whole
 and
 as
 their
 particular
 ˜elds
 of
 specialization.
Some professional standards apply throughout research, such as the injunc
-tion never to falsify or fabricate data or plagiarize research results. These are 
fundamental to research, and have been con˜rmed by leading organizations 
and codi˜ed in regulations.
3 Other standards are relevant only within speci˜c 
˜eldsŠsuch as requirements to conduct double-blind clinical trials.
 Researchers 
must adhere to both sets of standards if they are to maintain the integrity of 
research data, and they can adhere to professional standards only if they fully 
understand the standards.
Recommendation

 Although all researchers should understand digital technologies well 
enough to be con˜dent in the integrity of the data they generate, they cannot 
always be expected to be able to take full advantage of new capabilities. In 
an increasing number of ˜elds, professionals with expertise speci˜cally in the 
generation, analysis, storage, or dissemination of data are playing an essential 
role in taking advantage of digital technologies and ensuring the integrity of 
research data. 
Recommendation

 should
 ensure
 that the contributions
 of data professionals
 to research
 are
 appropri-ately
 recognized.
 In
 addition,

ENSURING ACCESS TO RESEARCH DATA
Advances in knowledge depend on the open ˚ow of information. Only if 
data and research results are shared can other researchers check the accuracy of 
the data, verify analyses and conclusions, and build on previous work. Further
-more, openness enables the results of research to be incorporated into socially 
bene˜cial goods and services and into public policies, improving the quality of 
life and the welfare of society.
Despite the many bene˜ts arising from the open availability of research 
data and results, many data are not publicly accessible, or their release is 
delayed, for a variety of reasons. Data may be withheld because they are being 
used to generate a commercial product or service, because of con˜dentiality 
considerations, or because of national security concerns. Furthermore, in some 
˜elds it is acceptable for researchers to have a limited period of exclusivity in 
which the data are used only by the principal investigators and their immediate

associates. In areas of potential commercial applications, patenting consider
-ations, contractual restrictions, and technological constraints also can limit or 
delay the accessibility of data.
Legitimate reasons may exist for keeping some data private or delaying 
their release, but the default assumption should be that research data, methods 
(including the techniques, procedures, and tools that have been used to collect, 
generate, or analyze data, such as models, computer code, and input data), and 
other information integral to a publicly reported result will be publicly acces
-sible when results are reported, at no more than the cost of ful˜lling a user 
request. This assumption underlies the following principle of accessibility:
Data Access and Sharing Principle: Research data, methods, and other infor
-mation integral to publicly reported results should be publicly accessible.
Although this principle applies throughout research, in some cases the 
open dissemination of research data may not be possible or advisable. Grant
-ing access to research data prior to reporting results based on those data can 
undermine the incentives for generating the data. There might also be technical 
barriers, such as the sheer size of datasets, that make sharing problematic, or 
legal restrictions on sharing as discussed in Chapter 3. Nevertheless, the main 
objective of the research enterprise must be to implement policies and promote 
practices that allow this principle to be realized as fully as possible.
This principle has important implications for researchers.
Recommendation
 5
: All
 researchers
 should
 make
 research
 data,
 methods,
 and
 other
 information
 integral
 to
 their

 publicly

 except
 in

 cases
 in

 data.
 In
 these
 cases,
 researchers
 should
 explain
 in
 a publicly
 accessible
 manner
 why
 the
 data
 are
 being
 withheld
 from

This principle may seem to apply only to publicly funded research, but a 
strong case can be made that much data from privately funded research should 
be made publicly available as well. Making such data available can produce 
societal bene˜ts while also preserving the commercial opportunities that moti
-vated the research.
As discussed earlier, differences in technological infrastructure, publication 
practices, data-sharing expectations, and other cultural practices have long 
existed between research ˜elds. In some ˜elds, aspects of this ﬁdata cultureﬂ 
act as barriers to access and sharing of data. With the growing importance of 
research results to certain areas of public policy, the rapid increase of interdisci
-plinary research that involves integration of data from different disciplines, and

7other trends, it is important for ˜elds of research to examine their standards 
and practices regarding data and to make these explicit.
Data accessibility standards generally depend on the norms of scholarly 
communication within a ˜eld. In many ˜elds these norms are now in a state 
of ˚ux. In some ˜elds, researchers may be expected to disseminate data and 
conclusions more rapidly than is possible through peer-reviewed publications. 
Digital technologies are providing new ways to disseminate research resultsŠ
for example, by making it possible to post draft papers on archival sites or by 
employing software packages, databases, blogs, or other communications on 
personal or institutional Web sites.
Data sharing is greatly facilitated when a ˜eld of research has standards and 
institutions in place that are designed to promote the accessibility of data. 
Recommendation

PROMOTING THE STEWARDSHIP OF RESEARCH DATA
Research data can be valuable for many years after they are generated. Data 
that led to initial insights can sometimes be used to generate new ˜ndings in 
the same or entirely different research ˜elds. Existing data can be reanalyzed 
or combined with new data to verify published results or arrive at new conclu
-sions. In some research areas, accessible databases have become essential parts 
of the research infrastructure, comparable to laboratories, research facilities, 
and computing devices and networks.
Maintaining high-quality and reliable databases can be costly, especially

 OF

over long time periods. Obviously not all data should be preserved, but decid
-ing what to save and what to discard becomes more dif˜cult as increasing 
quantities of data are generated. Because the future uses of data are dif˜cult to 
predict, returns on investments in stewardship can be uncertain. Furthermore, 
in many ˜elds of research, there is no consensus as to who should maintain large 
databases or who should bear the costs. These problems can be especially dif
-˜cult for investigators involved in small projects, who can face great challenges 
in deciding which data will be useful, in documenting those data thoroughly for 
future uses, and in ˜nding funds from limited budgets for data preservation.
The value of data for long-term use suggests the following general principle 
for the stewardship of data:
Data Stewardship Principle: Research data should be retained to serve 
future uses. Data that may have long-term value should be documented, ref
-erenced, and indexed so that others can ˜nd and use them accurately and 
appropriately.
Curating data requires documenting, referencing, and indexing the data so 
that they can be used accurately and appropriately in the future. Data steward
-ship must start at the beginning of the project, not partway through or at the 
end of the project. 
Recommendation
 9:
 Researchers
 should
 establish
 data
 management
 plans
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 each
 research
 project
 that
 include
 appropriate
 pro
visions
 for
 the
 stewardship
 of
 research
 data.
Because data without accompanying information about how they were 
derived can be useless, arranging for preserved data to be annotated so that they 
retain their long-term value is among the most important tasks for researchers 
establishing a data management plan.
This recommendation is not meant to imply that individual researchers are 
responsible for ensuring inde˜nite preservation of their own data, but that they 
ensure that data that are judged to have potential long-term value are prepared 
and transferred to the appropriate archives or repositories. Researchers should 
work in partnership with their institutions, sponsors, and ˜elds to formulate 
and implement their plans. 
Researchers need to participate in the development of policies and stan
-dards for data annotation, preservation, and long-term access. Data need not 
be annotated in such detail that nonspecialists can immediately use them, but 
guidelines should exist for the degree of expertise required to use a data collec
-tion. Researchers also need to develop procedures for error reporting, tracking, 
and correction. These policies and standards will vary greatly from ˜eld to ˜eld 
because they depend on the nature and potential uses of data. Nevertheless,

 The problem of paying for long-term stewardship of research data and 
other digital scholarly work is dif˜cult, and solutions need to be developed 
over time. It is important that requirements for improved data management 
practices not be imposed as unfunded mandates. In the digital age, data man
-agement needs to be integrated into research program funding as an essential 
component of the conduct of research. Where appropriate, grant applications 
should include costs for data stewardship.
Many issues regarding the integrity, accessibility, and stewardship of 
research data are common across the research enterprise. Bodies that oversee 
multiple ˜elds of research should disseminate lessons learned and help to foster 
interdisciplinary cooperation. Within the U.S. federal government, a recent 
report by the Interagency Working Group on Digital Data
 explores the needs 
for preservation and dissemination of publicly funded research data.
4 At the 
nongovernmental level, the National Research Council recently established 
a new Board on Research Data and Information that will address emerging 
issues in the management, policy, and use of research data at the national and 
international levels.

In a 1965 article in

, Gordon Moore, the cofounder 
of Intel, observed that the number of components on an integrated circuit per 
unit of cost was doubling on a regular basisŠa period he later set at 2 years.
1 What came to be known as Moore™s law has become a de˜ning property of the 
digital age.
2 For more than half a century, the power of computing available at 
a given cost has risen exponentially, which has increased computer power by 
many orders of magnitude. Today, the most powerful computers can perform 
more than a million billion operations per second. Storage devices can handle 
petabytes of information.
3 Data can be transferred at rates of 10 gigabits (or 
10 billion bits) per second (see Box 1-1 for a description of units of size for 
data). Sensors such as the charged-coupled devices used in modern cameras and 
telescopes can acquire data from billions of pixels simultaneously. Furthe
rmore, 
in key areas of computing, Moore™s law continues to hold.

4 Not all measures of computing power are increasing exponentially. For example, the transfer 
rate of data within computers from memory devices to the central processing unit is growing 
slowly and at a linear rate. Physical limitations on the power of single processors have constrained 
the continued general application of Moore™s law. However, new algorithms for processors and 
storage units linked in parallel may lead to resumed exponential increases in computing power in 
the future.

They can extract information about the functioning of nerve cells and construct 
models of neural processing. They can combine simultaneous measurements 
of atmospheric and oceanic conditions to predict the effects of pollutants 
on climates. They can extract patterns of health from extensive databases of

research ˜elds appear as sidebars throughout this report, and the number of 
such examples could be multiplied many times.
The advances in digital technologies have caused a massive increase in the 
quantity of data generated by research projects. The proposed Large Synoptic 
Survey Telescope is expected to gather 30 terabytes of data per night and more 
than 60 petabytes over its lifetime (see Box 1-2). Particle physics experiments 
conducted with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (Figure 1-2) will generate 
15 petabytes of data annually. Even relatively small-scale projects can generate 
immense quantities of data that can be valuable in multiple research ˜elds. 
These quantities of data are much too large to examine by hand. Instead, 
computers must conduct the initial analysis of data before the processed and 
condensed results are reviewed by researchers.

 Digital Data in Astronomy
 As astronomical observatories have become more powerful, they also have 
become more data-intensive.
a Table 1-1 shows the trend in recent decades. The Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), for example, has delivered an unprecedented ˜ood of data 
since it began operation in 2000. The SDSS uses a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope 
on Apache Point, New Mexico, equipped with two special-purpose instruments. The 
telescope™s camera can image 1.5 square degrees of sky at a timeŠabout eight times 
the area of the full moon. A pair of spectrographs can measure spectra ofŠand hence 
distances toŠmore than 600 galaxies and quasars in a single observation. A custom-
designed set of software pipelines keeps pace with the enormous data ˜ow from the 
telescope.
 In its ˚rst 5 years of operation, the Sloan telescope searched more than 8,000 
square degrees of the northern skyŠabout a ˚fth of the entire skyŠin ˚ve wavelength 
bands. It recorded some 217 million objects, mostly galaxies, stars, and asteroids, and 
measured spectra for around 675,000 of these.
b With funding from multiple sources and countries, the SDSS has followed a policy 
of freely releasing data annually, with separate Web sites for research users and the 
general public. A recent release, Data Release 7 (DR7), in November 2008, included 
some 16 terabytes of images and spectra. Its current phase, SDSS-II, is among the 
largest astronomical collaborations ever undertaken, involving more than 300 astrono
-mers, astrophysicists, and engineers at 25 institutions around the world.
 The SDSS has helped to revolutionize the interactions between a telescope, its 
data, and its user communities. Because the SDSS data archive is available to any 
astronomer, roughly half of the 2,100 refereed papers based on SDSS data have 
come from authors outside the project itself, and that proportion is rising. In fact, for 
the past 2 years, the SDSS has produced the most high-impact papers of any astro
-nomical observatory.
c At the same time, the project has extended the ﬁreachﬂ of those 
wishing to participate in frontier astronomy research or to simply enjoy the ability to 
ﬁbe thereﬂ as amateur a˚cionados. The public is offered both the raw data of SDSS 
and, at a ﬁSkyServerﬂ Web site, a range of search tools to help them use the data. 
Teachers are encouraged to adapt the projects for use in the classroom. SDSS data 
also are available through the National Virtual Observatory (http://www.us-vo.org), a 
collaborative effort involving universities, supercomputer centers, observatories, and 
data repositories.
d Even bigger projects are under development. For example, the Large Synoptic 
Survey Telescope (http:/www.lsst.org) that is currently being developed will generate 
as much data 
each night
 as a complete SDSS. As the ﬁLiving LSST Document, Version 
1.0, of May 15, 2008ﬂ put it: 
LSST has been conceived as a public facility: The database it will produce, 
and the associated object catalogs that are generated from that database, 
will be made available to the world™s astronomical research community and to 
the public at large with no proprietary period. The software which created the 
LSST database will be open source. LSST will be a signi˚cant milestone in the 
globalization of the information revolution. LSST will put terabytes of data each 
night into the hands of anyone who wants to explore it, and in some sense will 
become an Internet telescope: the ultimate network peripheral device to explore 
the universe, and a shared resource for all humanity.

 Digital Data in Astronomy
 As astronomical observatories have become more powerful, they also have 
become more data-intensive.
a Table 1-1 shows the trend in recent decades. The Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), for example, has delivered an unprecedented ˜ood of data 
since it began operation in 2000. The SDSS uses a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope 
on Apache Point, New Mexico, equipped with two special-purpose instruments. The 
telescope™s camera can image 1.5 square degrees of sky at a timeŠabout eight times 
the area of the full moon. A pair of spectrographs can measure spectra ofŠand hence 
distances toŠmore than 600 galaxies and quasars in a single observation. A custom-
designed set of software pipelines keeps pace with the enormous data ˜ow from the 
telescope.
 In its ˚rst 5 years of operation, the Sloan telescope searched more than 8,000 
square degrees of the northern skyŠabout a ˚fth of the entire skyŠin ˚ve wavelength 
bands. It recorded some 217 million objects, mostly galaxies, stars, and asteroids, and 
measured spectra for around 675,000 of these.
b With funding from multiple sources and countries, the SDSS has followed a policy 
of freely releasing data annually, with separate Web sites for research users and the 
general public. A recent release, Data Release 7 (DR7), in November 2008, included 
some 16 terabytes of images and spectra. Its current phase, SDSS-II, is among the

tory Network, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration™s 
Earth Observing System, depend heavily on sensor networks.
Digital technologies also are making possible a new kind of science that 
depends on simulations combined with experimentation and observation.
7 Cosmologists can combine simulations of galactic dynamics with astronomical 
observations of distant galaxies to analyze the early evolution of the universe. 
Records of calls made with cell phones can be compared to mathematical 
 
models of social networks. Researchers can model the functions of cells, simu
-late the effects of modifying those functions, and then re-create these modi˜
-cations in real cells to alter biological function and re˜ne the original models. 
Large-scale simulations of natural phenomena can be as valuable as data drawn 
from observations of the natural world.
The advances in research enabled by high-performance computing and 
high-performance communications are contributing to a steady growth of col
-laborations and interdisciplinary projects. Digital communication technologies 
enable researchers to communicate and exchange data with colleagues around 
the world, creating electronic collaborations that can catalyze progress. By 
making it possible to address more complex and integrative questions, these 
technologies also catalyze interdisciplinary collaboration. As one indicator of 
this trend, consider the growth in the number of authors on research papers 
over time. Over the course of 40 years, according to a computerized analysis of 
millions of published science and engineering papers, the number of authors 
for papers in the sciences nearly doubled, from 1.9 to 3.5.
8 In the environmental 
sciences, the fraction of papers with multiple authors rose from 25 percent to 
82 percent; in economics, it rose from 9 percent to 52 percent.
Collaborations have also become more international. In 2003, 20 per
-cent of all research publications had authors from more than one country, 
compared with 8 percent in 1988.
9 Citations to literature produced outside 
the author™s home country rose from 42 percent of all citations in 1992 to 
48 percent in 2003.
However, the most far-reaching effects of digital technologies are not 
evident in traditional measures of research collaboration. ResearchersŠand 
especially young researchersŠare developing new ways to interact with each 
other and with the subjects they study.

communities, write and read blogs on research developments, and are pioneer
-ing new methods to conduct research and share their results. In the long run, 
these developments are likely to have a more profound effect on research than 
increases in the pace or scale of traditional practices. These developments can 
be dif˜cult to foresee. For example, research in many ˜elds is moving toward 
much more open and collaborative models that are both served and driven by 
technology, and this trend is likely to result in research environments very dif
-ferent from those that have prevailed in the past. Although our committee has 
not tried to predict the long-term outcomes of this process, ongoing changes 
can be expected to continue to transform how research is done and how 
researchers interact with each other.
The rapid spread of digital technologies also is transforming the relation
-ship between researchers and the broader public that supports and expects to 
bene˜t from research. When research results that underlie important public 
policies are available electronically, they can be examined and questioned by 
any member of the public. Individuals interested in speci˜c issuesŠwhether 
the regulation of an environmental toxin or the development of therapies for a 
human diseaseŠcan monitor, comment on, and even shape ongoing research.
Similarly, digital technologies have profound implications for scienti˜c, 
engineering, and medical education.

 IN
 THE
 DIGITAL
 AGE 
19CHALLENGES POSED BY RESEARCH DATA IN A DIGITAL AGE
Rapid advances in computing and communication technologies have 
changed the professional responsibilities, interpersonal interactions, and daily 
practices of researchers. Many of these changes have strengthened the research 
enterprise, both by enabling researchers to ask new questions of nature and by 
providing new means of achieving research objectives. At the same time, some 
changes have raised important issues involving researchers, research institu
-tions, sponsors, and journals.
16
 These issues are the focus of this report on the 
integrity, accessibility, and stewardship of research data.
As discussed in Chapter 2, although advances in digital technologies allow 
phenomena and objects to be described more comprehensively and accurately, 
they also can complicate the process of verifying the accuracy and validity 
of the data (see Box 1-3 for an example). Digital technologies require the 
translation of phenomena and objects into digital representations, which can 
introduce inaccuracies into the data. Digital data often undergo several layers 
of complex processing as they move from an instrument or sensor to the point 
of being reviewed by a researcher. If this processing is not properly done or is 
misunderstood, the results can be misleading. In some cases, researchers may 
intentionally or unintentionally distort data in a misguided attempt to empha
-size particular features and downplay others. In the worst cases, researchers can 
falsify or fabricate data, thereby violating both the ethical and methodological 
standards of research integrity. Many of these considerations apply as well to 
data that are not generated or stored digitally, but digital technologies both 
expand and intensify the challenge of maintaining the integrity of data.
Chapter 3 describes the challenges that researchers face in maintaining 
the traditional openness of research in a digital age. Electronic technologies 
provide researchers with many new ways of communicating data to others, but 
providing other researchers with access to large databases can be dif˜cult and 
expensive. With smaller, heterogeneous databases, where quality control and 
documentation tend to be less formal, sociological and technological factors can 
restrict data sharing. Also, an increasing range of restrictions are being placed 
on research data as this information becomes more valuable for commercial 
uses, which can limit the distribution and utilization of data within and beyond 
the research community.
Even as more research data are being created, their value for future uses 
is increasing. Chapter 4 describes the need to preserve many research data for 
long-term use, even in situations where those uses cannot be currently envi
-sioned. Digital storage technologies, application environments, and operating 
systems change every few years, which means that digital bits must continually

BOX 1-3
 Digital Data in the Neurosciences
 The neurosciences illustrate both the potential value of well-organized and 
accessible data and the variety of issues raised by the increased importance of data 
handling and data sharing.
 It is not surprising that the neurosciences are rich in the use of and need for 
data, given the complexity of the nervous system. The brain has roughly a hundred 
billion neurons and more than 1,000 subdivisions, each with different structures and 
circuitry. In the past, neurological research has depended heavily on autopsy for clues 
about function and structure. Now it relies heavily on in vivo imaging methods and 
computational models, both of which depend on computing power and mathematical 
techniques.
 This new universe of neuroscience data is too vast and complex for manual 
analysis. Large-scale detailed maps of the brain can require some 25 gigabytes of 
memory per image. Also, neuroscientists must work across multiple scales of resolu
-tion because they do not yet know which levels are critical for many neurological 
processes. They must integrate such diverse datasets as cellular neuroimaging, gene 
expression data, genotype data, neuronal morphology, and clinical data.
 Making neuroscience data widely available holds tremendous potential for help
-ing science and society. This includes:

Facilitating replication and validation of experimental results,

Promoting collective analyses of large numbers of experiments by different 
groups,

Improving communication within and between groups, and

Promoting collaboration.
 Several very effective databases have been developed in the neurosciences. 
They include:

The Cell Centered Database, started in 2002, makes two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional static and dynamic microscopic data available to the research com
-munity. It also links data obtained at cellular and subcellular scales to molecular and 
higher order structure. It is built on the Biomedical Informatics Research Network and 
Telescience grid infrastructure for distributed collaboration.

SumsDB is a repository of brain-mapping data, including surfaces and vol
-umes, with both structural and functional data. It includes more than 500 studies on 
monkeys, rodents, apes, humans, and others, totaling about 10 percent of the pub
-lished literature. It also includes a data mining tool called WebCaret so that SumsDB 
can be searched online without downloading. Its designers have made attempts to 
provide metadata and show the source of data, including links to online publications.
 Many questions have arisen in developing these and other databases. Which 
digital data and data stored on ˚lm need to be stored? Do calibrations (i.e., the char
-acterization of an instrument™s response to known stimulus) need to be stored, and 
if so which ones? Should proprietary tools be stored so that users can see how the 
primary data were processed? For now, there is reason to err on the side of deposit
-ing too much data, because no one knows what subsequent researchers will need. 
However, it is likely that just a small percentage of databases will ˚nd widespread use, 
which complicates, rather than simpli˚es, the task of storage.
 Complex databases always include errors. Obvious errors, such as coordinates 
that lie outside the brain, can be found more easily when data are shared. However, 
policing data before they are added to a database can be so time-intensive that it can 
discourage database building. Fortunately, new technologies for assuring the quality 
of data based on advances in such areas as pattern recognition and learning theory, 
combined with rapid advances in data processing and storage, are providing new and 
automated methods for testing the quality of data.
 Another problem is that most data assigned to databases in the neurosciences 
are not adequately annotated, and even those with annotation tend to use nonstan
-dard terminology, making them ﬁislandsﬂ of diverse resources. Such databases may 
not be useful for comparative studies or other purposes.
 Issues of who has rights to use data also are far from resolved. A researcher may 
work for 5 years to assemble data on a transgenic mouse and be reluctant to give the 
data away. To make data open and accessible, incentives may need to be developed 
to encourage scientists to share their data.
 Another issue is whether journals may be responsible for receiving and storing 
all primary or supplementary data. Most publications lack a suitable place to enter and 
store supplementary data, and who should pay for this service remains unresolved.
 These issues, most of which we discuss later in this report, are being extensively 
explored in the research and policy-making communities. Many questions do not yet 
have clear answers that extend across all research disciplines.

all primary or supplementary data. Most publications lack a suitable place to enter and 
store supplementary data, and who should pay for this service remains unresolved.
 These issues, most of which we discuss later in this report, are being extensively 
explored in the research and policy-making communities. Many questions do not yet 
have clear answers that extend across all research disciplines.

they are not to be lost. Digital data also need to be annotated in suf˜cient detail 
that future researchers, sometimes in ˜elds well removed from those of the data™s 
original creators, can both use the data and understand their limitations. Main
-taining data collections for long-term use thus requires continued investment 
and planning, which can compete with expenditures for ongoing research.
DESCRIPTIONS OF TERMS USED IN THE REPORT
In describing issues as broad as those covered in this report, it is essential 
to have clear understanding of the basic terms. 
Research Data
Despite the importance of research data, there exists no standard or widely 
accepted de˜nition of exactly what research data are. For the purposes of this 
report, we have treated data as 
information
 used
 in
 scienti˜c,
 engineering,
 and
 medical
 research
 as
 inputs
 to
 generate
 research
 conclusions
 (see Box 1-4 for de˜ni
-tions from other reports). This usage encompasses a wide variety of information. 
It includes textual information, numeric information, instrumental readouts, 
equations, statistics, images (whether ˜xed or moving), diagrams, and audio 
recordings. It includes raw data, processed data, published data, and archived 
data. It includes the data generated by experiments, by models and simulations, 
and by observations of natural phenomena at speci˜c times and locations. It 
includes data gathered speci˜cally for research as well as information gathered 
for other purposes that is then used in research. It includes data stored on a wide 
variety of media, including magnetic and optical media.
17
Though our concerns in this report lie largely with the application of digi
-tal technologies in research, our examination of the issues is not limited to 
 
digital data. Nor does this report address just those areas traditionally consid
-ered ﬁscience.ﬂ It applies to all efforts to derive new knowledge about the physi
-cal, biological, or social worlds and thus encompasses research in engineering 
and in all of the physical, biological, behavioral, and social sciences. The conclu
-sions in the report generally apply to quantitative data. However, many of our 
conclusions also apply to qualitative data, though we have not focused on the 
issues unique to qualitative data. Also, this report does not address research in 
the humanities, which lies outside the committee™s charge and expertise.
17 
As a point of comparison, the Of˜ce of Management and Budget de˜nes research data as ﬁthe 
recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scienti˜c community as necessary to validate 
research ˜ndings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, drafts of scienti˜c papers, 
plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This ﬁrecordedﬂ 
 
material excludes physical objects (e.g., laboratory samples).ﬂ See OMB Circular A-110 at http://

 The term ﬁdataﬂ in this report excludes physical objects (including living 
organisms) and other materials used in research, such as biological reagents or 
the devices, instruments, or computers that generate experimental or observa
-tional data. In many cases, these physical objects can be described in written, 
numeric, or visual forms, and these descriptions constitute data. However, 
because materials are tangible whereas data are generally intangible, different 
issues surround their use, storage, and dissemination. Some of the observa
-tions and conclusions in this report apply to materials as well as to data, and 
on occasion we make this extension of our conclusions explicit. However, the 
treatment of materials in research introduces issues that are beyond the subject 
matter of this report.

tive statements, or matters of personal judgment, such as peer reviews, plans 
for future research, communications with colleagues, or personnel assess
-ments. Of course, the line between research data and subjective judgments 
is sometimes dif˜cult to draw, since subjective judgments can in˚uence the 
structure ascribed to data. Nevertheless, a distinction exists, and we do not 
mean to imply that all of the information associated with research necessarily 
constitutes research data.
Metadata
As used in this report, the term ﬁmetadataﬂ refers to descriptions of 
the
 content,
 context,
 and
 structure
 of
 information
 objects,
 including
 research
 data,
 at
 any
 le
vel
 of
 aggregation
 (for
 example,
 a single
 data
 item,
 many
 items,
 or
 an
 entire
 database).
 According to the National Science Foundation report 
Cyber
-infrastructure
 Vision
 for
 the
 21st
 Century
, metadata ﬁsummarize data content, 
context, structure, interrelationships, and provenance (information on history 
and origins). They add relevance and purpose to data, and enable the identi˜ca
-tion of similar data in different data collections.ﬂ
19
 Metadata make it easier for 
data users to ˜nd and utilize data, particularly if they are machine-readable.
Metadata are extremely diverse, ranging from written descriptions of 
instruments and software to the largely tacit knowledge on which the success of 
an investigation often depends. They are a critical part of the context needed 
to assess the integrity of data and use data accurately. Metadata are themselves 
data, since they consist of descriptive, factual information about data. Thus, 
conclusions about data in this report generally apply to metadata as well, 
although special considerations sometimes apply to metadata.
Until fairly recently, the term ﬁmetadataﬂ was used primarily by the library 
community and by individual research communities.
20
 As digital data has 
become more important in a variety of disciplines and ˜elds, the scope and 
value of metadata have grown, leading to the development of metadata stan
-dards. Metadata standards represent an agreed set of terminologies, de˜nitions, 
and values to be provided for data in a given ˜eld or community.

 DATA
 IN
 THE
 DIGITAL
 AGE 
25Raw and Processed Data
Raw data directly from an instrument or data that have not been docu
-mented or processed usually are of little value to anyone except the individuals 
who generate or collect them. In many ˜elds, capturing data that are ﬁwholeﬂ 
or ﬁperfectﬂ may be dif˜cult or impossible. Instruments may only partially and 
imperfectly record phenomena. Researchers may not even see the raw data on 
which their conclusions are based. In some cases, raw data may exist in a com
-puter buffer for only a fraction of a second before they undergo processing. In 
other cases, raw data may be so voluminous that they cannot be examined in 
anything other than a processed or condensed form. However, raw data may 
need to be retained to validate research ˜ndings and, in some research ˜elds, 
to support patent applications, investigate instances of research misconduct, or 
justify public policies.
Data used to draw conclusions, derive ˜ndings, and build models may 
undergo many changes as they are processed, distributed, and archived. They 
are analyzed, aggregated, and reformulated by researchers. Data often are orga
-nized into structures for long-term storage and access that require the expertise 
of professionals trained in the management and handling of large databases.
As soon as raw data are processed, the algorithms, computer programs, and 
other techniques used in that processing become crucial to their understand
-ing. Many data cannot be properly interpreted or used without understanding 
the processing they have undergone, and it is generally impossible to judge 
the integrity of processed data without access to the metadata documenting 
how they were processed. In some cases, this processing may be so machine-
 
dependent that the metadata must include either a thorough representation 
or a copy of the devices used to do the processing. Consequently, to judge 
the accuracy and validity of data, researchers, policy makers, and other users 
of data may need a thorough understanding of the tools and procedures used 
to analyze those data. In many cases, a high level of expertise is needed to use 
metadata in order to place data in context.
Given the relatively broad de˜nitions of data and metadata that we have 
adopted in this report, a great many issues are obviously associated with the 
generation, use, dissemination, and preservation of research data in the
 digital 
age. In this report, however, we focus on three speci˜c issues, which we describe 
using the terms integrity, accessibility, and stewardship.
Integrity
Integrity describes an uncompromising adherence to ethical values, strict 
honesty, and absolute avoidance of deception. Integrity also describes the state 
of being whole and complete, of being totally unimpaired. Thus, the word 
ﬁintegrityﬂ has both an ethical meaning and a structural or methodological 
meaning. In this report we use the word ﬁintegrityﬂ in both senses.
Ensuring the Integrity, Accessibility, and Stewardship of Research Data in the Digital AgeCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.26 ENSURING
 THE
 INTEGRITY,
 ACCESSIBILITY,
 AND
 STEWARDSHIP
 OF
 DATA
According to one de˜nition, ﬁbeing assured of data™s integrity means hav
-ing con˜dence that the data are complete, veri˜ed, and remain unaltered.ﬂ
22
 This is possible only if researchers adhere to professional and ethical standards 
of their ˜elds. In some research ˜elds, these standards are written, but in many 
areas they exist as tacit knowledge that is passed from senior researchers to 
beginning researchers over the course of a research apprenticeship. These pro
-fessional standards, in turn, describe the methods, procedures, and tools that 
researchers are expected to employ to minimize error and bias in their work. 
Consequently, integrity in research has both an individual and a communal 
meaning. Researchers maintain the integrity of research data by adhering to the 
professional standards of their ˜elds.
Researchers are expected to describe their methods and tools to others 
in suf˜cient detail that the data can be checked and the results veri˜ed. Com
-pletely and accurately describing the conditions under which data are collected, 
characterizing the equipment used and its response, and recording anything 
that was done to the data thereafter are critical to ensuring data integrity. Thus, 
for experimental data, integrity implies that the data can be reproduced in a test 
or experiment that repeats the conditions of the original test or experiment. For 
observational data, data of high ﬁqualityﬂ (a term that we sometimes will use 
as a synonym for data integrity) have been validated through comparison with 
data whose quality is known or by being generated with an instrument that has 
been adequately calibrated or tested.
Accessibility
In this report, accessibility refers to the availability of research data to 
researchers other than those who generated the data. Accessibility is a critical 
element of integrity, because data must be available to others in order for the 
validity of those data to be veri˜ed. However, in some cases an investigator may 
not be able to make data available to the public. For example, in private compa
-nies, data may need to be restricted for commercial reasons. In such cases, data 
are frequently made available within the company to evaluate their integrity.
In this report, the term ﬁaccessibilityﬂ generally implies public access as 
well as availability to other researchers upon request. Accessibility does not 
necessarily imply free access, because providing access to data entails ˜nancial 
costs that must be met. Also, access does not necessarily imply that
 researchers 
must provide inquirers with the training and expertise they would need to 
understand or use data. However, data should be accompanied by suf˜cient 
metadata for colleagues to assess the integrity of those data.

 THE
 DIGITAL
 AGE 
27Stewardship
In the broadest possible sense, the term ﬁutilityﬂ in the name of our com
-mittee refers to all of the various applications of research data. Both integrity 
and accessibility are critical elements of utility, because research data must have 
integrity and be broadly accessible to be effectively utilized.
However, our focus in this report is on a speci˜c aspect of utility that we 
refer to as data 
stewardship
Šthe long-term preservation of data so as to ensure 
their continued value, sometimes for unanticipated uses. Stewardship goes 
beyond simply making data accessible. It implies preserving data and metadata 
so that they can be used by researchers in the same ˜eld and in ˜elds other 
than that of the data™s creators. It implies the active curation and preservation 
of data over extended periods, which generally requires moving data from one 
storage platform to another. The term ﬁstewardshipﬂ embodies a conception 
of research in which data are both an end product of research and a vital com
-ponent of the research infrastructure.
THE 
VARIETIES OF RESEARCH DATA
As the examples presented throughout this report illustrate, research 
data are so varied that they can be described in their entirety only in the most 
general terms. Different research ˜elds have very different approaches to the 
treatment of research data. Even at the level of individual research groups, 
expectations and demands can vary greatly from one investigator to another. 
This tremendous variety within the research community complicates the task 
of arriving at conclusions that apply across all ˜elds of research. Research ˜elds 
are also characterized by diversity in the origins of data and by the size and 
other characteristics of data collections.
Diversity Across Disciplines
There is great diversity in the ways data are gathered and analyzed both 
among and within disciplines. The sidebars in this and other chapters describe 
some of the diversity among disciplines, but individual disciplines also harbor 
great diversity in the ways data are gathered and analyzed. Data in physics, for 
example, range from small datasets generated by a ﬁtabletopﬂ experiment to 
the terabytes of data generated by an accelerator-based experiment. Databases 
in the social sciences may be freely available to all researchers in some ˜elds 
and tightly restricted in other ˜elds. Some ˜elds within a discipline may have 
traditions of storing data for extended periods while others discard data rela
-tively quickly. (In this report, ﬁ˜eldﬂ refers to an area of research smaller than a 
discipline. In many cases, a ˜eld can be roughly associated with the community 
of researchers who follow and publish articles in a relatively small collection

 OF

of related journalsŠwhat analysts of science have referred to as ﬁinvisible 
colleges.ﬂ
23
)Furthermore, some of the most interesting and productive areas of research 
today involve researchers from multiple disciplines working together on com
-plex, integrative problems.
24
 In some cases, these areas of multidisciplinary 
research become so well de˜ned that they evolve into research ˜elds of their 
own, as in astrobiology. In other cases, researchers may come together to 
work on a multidisciplinary project and then disband once the project is over. 
In interdisciplinary research, different traditions of data treatment meet and 
sometimes clash, and new ways to gather, analyze, and store data may need to 
be developed to address novel challenges.
Diversity in Origins of Data
The practices for analyzing, disseminating, and storing research data vary 
greatly from ˜eld to ˜eld.
25
 For example, in some ˜elds, observational data can 
be re-created by other researchers, but in other ˜elds observations are impos
-sible or impractical to make a second time. In these cases, observational data 
may need to be carefully archived for future use, including uses that cannot 
currently be foreseen.
Data generated through computer simulations are increasingly important 
in a variety of ˜elds.
26
 Data generated entirely by computation can in principle 
be regenerated, assuming that enough is known about the hardware, software, 
and inputs used in the computation. However, each of these three components 
of a computation may be so complex or indeterminate that the computational 
data have some of the characteristics of observational data. Furthermore, many 
simulations involve random inputs, so that successive simulations will not be 
exactly the same. In some cases, sharing and preserving the models and soft
-ware tools used to create a simulation will be more important for verifying 
and building upon research than sharing and preserving the data generated. 
In other cases, the data themselves have value and can represent such a large 
investment of resources that they may need to be preserved for subsequent use 
in the same way that unique observational data are preserved.

Data from experiments may be reproducible if a robust description of the 
experiment is available. In practice, however, it may not be possible to re-create 
the exact conditions of the experiment. An experimental apparatus also may be 
so costly to build or use that experiments can be conducted only once or over a 
limited time period. If so, long-term preservation of the data generated by the 
experiment may be essential for optimizing the experiment™s value.
Diversity in Types of Data Collections
In this report, we use the term ﬁdatabaseﬂ to refer to a collection of data 
that is organized to permit search, retrieval, processing, and reorganization 
of stored information. Databases include datasets, which are collections of 
similar or related data. We use the term ﬁdata collectionﬂ interchangeably with 
ﬁdatabase.ﬂ
In its report 
Long-Li
ved
 Data
 Collections:
 Enabling
 Research
 and
 Education
 in
 the

 Century
, the National Science Board divided data collections into 
three broad categories (Box 1-5).
27
 ﬁResearch collectionsﬂ are the products 
of one or more focused research projects and typically serve just the research 
group that generated the data. ﬁResource collectionsﬂ serve a single science 
or engineering community and are generally intermediate in size and budget. 
ﬁReference collectionsﬂ serve large segments of the research and education 
communities and are often supported by large budgets.
These categories may seem to correspond to small-scale research, inter
-mediate-sized research projects, and large-scale research, but the National 
 
Science Board™s report shows that such an association can be misleading. Using 
digital technologies, relatively small-scale projects can generate immense quan
-tities of data that become the basis for research in many related ˜elds. Large-
scale reference data collections may be the product of many small projects 
linked through digital networks. Or large projects may produce focused data 
collections that serve a narrow research purpose and never become publicly 
available. Thus, distinguishing research data by the size of the group that gen
-erated those data is problematicŠin part because of new capabilities created 
by digital technologies.
STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT
The remainder of this report is organized into three thematic chapters and 
a ˜nal summary chapter. Chapter 2 considers the integrity of data throughout 
their life cycle, from their collection to their disposal or preservation. Maintain

BOX 1-5
 Three Types of Data Collections
 The National Science Board (NSB) has organized data collections into the three 
categories described below. In addition, the NSB de˚ned ﬁcollectionﬂ to refer ﬁnot only 
to stored data but also to the infrastructure, organizations, and individuals necessary 
to preserve access to the data.ﬂ
 Research data collections
 are the products of one or more focused research 
 
projects and typically contain data that are subject to limited processing or curation. 
They may or may not conform to community standards, such as standards for ˚le 
formats, metadata structure, and content access policies. Quite often, applicable 
standards may be nonexistent or rudimentary because the data types are novel and 
the size of the user community [is] small. Research collections may vary greatly in 
size but are intended to serve a speci˚c group, often limited to immediate participants. 
There may be no intention to preserve the collection beyond the end of a project. One 
reason for this is funding. These collections are supported by relatively small budgets, 
often through research grants funding a speci˚c project. (Example: The Fluxes Over 
Snow Surfaces Project, http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rtf/projects/FLOSS.)
 Resource or community data
 collections serve a single science or engineering 
community. These digital collections often establish community-level standards either 
by selecting from among preexisting standards or by bringing the community together 
to develop new standards where they are absent or inadequate. The budgets for 
resource or community data collections are intermediate in size and generally are 
provided through direct funding from agencies. Because of changes in agency priori
-ties, it is often dif˚cult to anticipate how long a resource or community data collection 
will be maintained. (Example: The Arabidopsis Information Resource, http://www.
arabidopsis.org.)
 Reference data collections
 are intended to serve large segments of the research 
and education community. Characteristic features of this category of digital collections 
are a broad scope and a diverse set of user communities including scientists,
 students, 
and educators from a wide variety of disciplinary, institutional, and geographical set
-tings. In these circumstances, conformance to robust, well-established, and compre
-hensive standards is essential, and the selection of standards by reference collections 
often has the effect of creating a universal standard. Budgets supporting reference 
collections are often large, re˜ecting the scope of the collection and breadth of impact. 
Typically, the budgets come from multiple sources and are in the form of direct, long-
term support, and the expectation is that these collections will be maintained inde˚
-nitely. (Example: Protein Data Bank, http://www.pdb.org.)

achieving this objective in the digital age can be either easier or more dif˜cult 
than in earlier times.
Chapter 3 considers the issues of accessing and sharing research data. The 
research enterprise is built on the precept that researchers will make the data on 
which publicly disseminated conclusions are based available to their colleagues 
so that others can verify and build on those data. Accessibility is vital for ensur
-ing the integrity of research data and facilitating their future use.
Chapter 4 discusses the stewardship of research data, that is, their long-
term preservation in databases for various future research uses and other appli
-cations. Preserving data collections can be expensive and dif˜cultŠso much so 
that it can compete with the conduct of research. Yet the loss of many kinds of 
research data also can incur substantial costs.
The ˜nal chapter reorganizes recommendations that have appeared earlier 
in the volume according to different actors within the research community 
rather than thematically. It also discusses how action can be motivated when 
responsibility for research integrity, accessibility, and stewardship is shared 
across the components of the research community. Each part of the research 
enterprise has much to gain or lose, depending on how research data are man
-aged, and each has a role to play in ensuring the integrity, accessibility, and 
stewardship of research data.

All rights reserved.2Ensuring the Integrity of Research Data
The ˜elds of science span the totality of natural phenomena and their 
styles are enormously varied. Consequently, science is too broad an enterprise 
to permit many generalizations about its conduct. One theme, however, threads 
through its many ˜elds: the primacy of scrupulously recorded data. Because the 
techniques that researchers employ to ensure the truth and accuracy of their 
data are as varied as the ˜elds themselves, there are no universal procedures 
for achieving technical accuracy. There are, however, some broadly accepted 
practices for pursuing science. In most ˜elds of science, for instance, experi
-mental observations must be shown to be reproducible in order to be credit
-able.
1 Other practices include checking and rechecking data to ensure that the 
interpretation is valid, and also submitting the results to peer review to further 
con˜rm that the ˜ndings are sound. Yet other practices may be employed only 
within speci˜c ˜elds, for instance, the use of double-blind trials, or the inde
-pendent veri˜cation of important results in separate laboratories.
Although the pervasive use of high-speed computing and communica
-tions in research has vastly expanded the capabilities of researchers, if used 
 
inappropriately or carelessly, digital technologies can lower the quality of data 
and compromise the integrity of research.
2 Digitization may introduce
 spurious 
information into a representation, and complex digital analyses of data can 
yield misleading results if researchers are not scrupulously careful in monitor
-ing and understanding the analysis process. Because so much of the processing 
1 Even this fundamental principle can have exceptions. For instance, observations with a his
-torical element, such as the explosion of a supernova or the growth of an epidemic, cannot be 
reproduced.
2 The challenges of maintaining data integrity over the long term, including the decay of physical 
storage media and improper manipulation of archived data, are discussed in Chapter 4.

and communication of digital data are done by computers with relatively little 
human oversight, erroneous data can be rapidly multiplied and widely dissemi
-nated. Some projects generate so much data that signi˜cant patterns or signals 
can be lost in a deluge of information. As an example of the challenges posed 
by digital research data, Box 2-1 explores these issues in the context of particle 
physics research.
Because digital data can be manipulated more easily than can other forms 
of data, digital data are particularly susceptible to distortion. ResearchersŠand 
othersŠmay be tempted to distort data in a misguided effort to clarify results. 
In the worst cases, they may even falsify or fabricate data.

physics, to the creation of the World Wide Web and the data acquisition technology 
for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), particle physics has been a major innovator of 
digital data technology. The LHC, which recently came into operation at the European 
Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, has spawned a new generation of 
data processing. The accelerator collides two beams of protons, resulting in about a 
billion proton-proton collisions every second. These collisions occur at several points 
around the 27-km circumference of the circular accelerator. This ˚rst step of the pro
-cess is dif˚cult enough to imagine, but the next steps are even more amazing.
 Part of the energy carried by the two colliding protons is converted into matter 
by fundamental processes of nature. Some of these processes are well understood, 
but others might represent major discoveries that could deepen our understanding of 
the universeŠfor instance, the creation of particles that constitute the so-called dark 
matter inferred from astrophysical measurements.
 The spray of energetic outgoing particles from one such collision is called an 
event.
 The particles in the spray have speeds approaching the speed of light. They ˜y 
out of the proton-proton collision point into a surrounding region that is instrumented 
with an array of sophisticated particle detection devices, collectively called a detector. 
The detector senses the passage of subatomic particles, creating a detailed electronic 
image of the event and providing quantitative information about each particle such as 
its energy and its relation to certain other particles.
 Each proton-proton collision generates about 1 megabyte of information, yield
-ing a total rate of 1 petabyte per second. It is not practical to record this staggering 
amount of information, and so the experimenters have devised techniques for rapidly 
selecting the most promising subset of the data for exhaustive analysis.
 Only a tiny fraction of the delugeŠperhaps one in a trillionŠwill be due to 
new kinds of physical processes of fundamental importance. Once the detector has 
recorded an event, a high-speed system performs a rapid analysis (within 3 micro
-seconds) that retains typically 1 in 30,000 of all events. A second rapid analysis 
step reduces the rate of permanently recorded data down to about 100 events per 
second. Research at the LHC is carried about by international collaborations that con
-struct, operate, and analyze the data from each of the four main detectors. The scale of 
the research borders on the fantastic: Two of the collaborations each have about 2,000 
members from 40 different countries; the volume of the ATLAS detector, for example, is 
about half that of Notre Dame cathedral, and the mass of iron in its gigantic solenoid 
magnet is approximately that in the Eiffel Tower.
 LHC detectors are complex systems that require meticulous calibration, align
-ment, and quality control procedures. The data from an LHC detector ˜ow from the 
arrays of devices that track the particles emitted when the protons collide. The data 
processing system determines the momentum and energy of each particle radiated 
from a collision, and identi˚es how the particles are correlated in space and time. 
The thousands of detection devices, the magnetic ˚eld in which the collisions occur, 
and the properties of the complex digital data acquisition system must all be known 
accurately. The complexities of data analysis in LHC experiments are comparable to 
those of the apparatus itself.
 Ensuring the integrity of data from a particle physics experiment presents special 
challenges because no form of traditional peer review would be suf˚cient. The experi
-ments are so complicated that a knowledgeable outsider who attempted to evaluate 
the performance of the detection system would require years for the job. Consequently, 
the particle physics community has developed a method for reliable internal quality 
assurance that goes beyond straightforward peer review.
 As part of each major collaboration, multiple data-analysis teams work to evalu
-ate the performance of the apparatus and analyze the data independently, withholding 
their ˚nal results until the latest possible moment. In effect, in the particle physics 
community a major portion of the role that was traditionally played by straightforward 
peer review has been augmented by a process of critical self-analysis.

disclosed in the ˜gure legend. All digital images in manuscripts accepted for publica

manipulation. Questions raised by the production department will be referred to the 
Editors, who will request the original data from the authors for comparison to the pre

 manuscript 
may be revoked. Cases in which the manipulation affects the interpretation of the 
data will result in revocation of acceptance, and will be reported to the corresponding 
author™s home institution or funding agency.

Having developed this policy, the editors at the 
Journal
 of
 Cell
 Biology
 began to screen all of the images in accepted articles for evidence of inappro
-priate manipulation. For example, simple brightness and contrast adjustments 
could reveal inconsistencies in the background of the image that are clues to 
manipulation. In this way, the editors could determine whether the images 
presented in a manuscript were an accurate representation of what was actually 
observed and whether the quality or context in which the images were obtained 
was apparent.
Over the course of the next 5 years, the editors screened the images in 
1,869 accepted papers.
3 Over a quarter of the manuscripts contained one or 
more images that had been inappropriately manipulated. In the vast majority 
of those cases, the manipulation violated the journal™s guidelines but did not 
affect the interpretation of the data, and the articles were published after the 
authors revised the images in accordance with the guidelines.
In 18 of the papersŠabout 1 percent of the total for which the edi
-tors sought and obtained the original dataŠthe editors determined that the 
image manipulations affected the interpretation of the data. The acceptance 
of those papers was revoked, and they were not published. In only one case 
did the authors state that the original data could not be found and withdrew 
the paper. 
According to a federal de˜nition of research misconduct developed by the

4 However, the editors at the

 do not consider the element of ﬁintentﬂ in their inquiries into 
potential violations of their guidelines. They obtain the original data directly 
from the authors, since whether an image has been inappropriately manipulated 
can be determined only by comparing the submitted ˜gures with the original 
data. Initial inquiries from the journal emphasize that questions are being asked 
only about the presentation of data, not its integrity, and inquiries are kept 
strictly con˜dential between a journal and authors.

 by the Council of Science Editors, which 
was written by the editors at the

, suggests that ﬁjournal 
editors should attempt to resolve the problem before a case is reported. This is 
because the vast majority of cases do not turn out to be fraudulent.ﬂ
5Since the 
Journal
 of
 Cell
 Biology
 adopted its policy, other journals, includ
-ing the 
Proceedings
 of
 the
 National
 Academy
 of
 Sciences
 and 
Nature
, have begun 
screening images for evidence of inappropriate manipulation (see Table 2-1). 
Generally, these journals have screened a subset of papers and have made the 
additional level of scrutiny known to authors in the hope that this will act as 
a disincentive to manipulation.
6 In addition, software is being developed that 
may automate at least part of the screening process so that more images can be 
examined with less expense.
Publishers of scienti˜c, engineering, and medical journals continue to 
grapple with issues related to technological change and ensuring the integrity 
of published results. Concurrent with the present study, a number of leading 
journals have held a series of meetings to discuss these issues. One question is 
whether the additional efforts on the part of journals to screen digital images 
entail additional responsibilities. For example, suppose a journal screens digital 
images in a manuscript, ˜nds something suspicious, and after undertaking an 
inquiry and ˜nding that an image has been fraudulently manipulated rejects 
the paper. Does the journal have further responsibilities, and if so what are 
they? According to the

 by the Council of Science Editors, when a journal ﬁsuspects an

to misrepresentation. Digital technologies can introduce technical sources of 
error into data analysis, communication, or storage systems. At the frontiers 
of human knowledge, the data that bear on a problem can be very dif˜cult to 
separate from irrelevant information.
10
 Research methods may not be ˜rmly 
established, and even the questions being asked may not be fully de˜ned.
Furthermore, researchers may have incentives to structure research or 
gather data in ways that favor a particular outcome, as in the case of drug 
 
studies funded by companies that stand to pro˜t from particular results.
11
 In 
addition, researchers can have philosophical, political, or religious convictions 
that can in˚uence their work, including the ways they collect and interpret 
data.
12
 Because of the many ways in which data can depart from empirical reali
-ties, everyone involved in the collection, analysis, dissemination, and preserva
-tion of data has a responsibility to safeguard the integrity of data.
THE ROLES OF DATA PRODUCERS, PRO
VIDERS, AND USERS
The example from the 
Journal
 of
 Cell
 Biology
 illustrates the different roles 
that individuals and groups can play in ensuring the integrity of data. For the 
purposes of this report, we have divided these individuals and groups into three 
categoriesŠdata producers, data providers, and data usersŠthough it should 
be kept it mind that many individuals and organizations fall into more than one 
of these categories.
Data
 producers
 are the scientists, engineers, students, and others who gener
-ate data, whether through observations, experiments, simulations, or the gather
-ing of information from other sources. Often the creation of data is an explicit 
objective of research, but data can be generated in many ways. For example, 
administrative records, archaeological artifacts, cell phone logs, or many other 
forms of information can be adapted to serve as inputs to research. Data also 
are produced by government agencies in the course of performing tasks for 
other purposes (such as remote sensing for weather forecasts or conducting 
the decadal censuses), and these data can be used extensively for research. This 
report focuses on data produced through activities that are related primarily 
to research, but the general principles laid out in this report apply to all data 
used in research.

Data
 pro
viders
 consist of the individuals and organizations who are respon
-sible, whether formally or informally, for making data accessible to others. 
Sometimes a data provider may be simply the producer of those data, because 
data producers generally are expected to make data available to verify research 
conclusions and allow for the continued progress of research. In other cases, 
data may be deposited in a repository, center, or archive that has the respon
-sibility of disseminating the data. Journals also can be data providers, either 
through the articles they publish or through the provision of supplementary 
material that supports a published article.
Data
 users
 are the individuals and groups who access data in order to use 
those data in their own work, whether in research or in other endeavors. At one 
extreme, the users of data may belong entirely to the community of originating 
researchers (as in the case of elementary particle physics, which is described in 
this chapter). At the other extreme, a given body of data may be of wide inter
-est to people outside a research ˜eld (as in the case of climate records, which 
is discussed in Chapter 3). Data producers are generally data users, but the 
collective body of data users extends beyond the research community to policy 
makers, educators, the media, the courts, and others. Data users can work in 
˜elds quite different from those of data producers, which means that they have 
an interest in being able to access data that are well annotated in order to use 
them accurately and appropriately.
As described below, each of these three groups has particular responsibili
-ties in ensuring the integrity of research data.
 THE COLLECTI
VE SCRUTINY OF RESEARCH DATA AND RESULTS
In Chapter 1, we noted that measures of data integrity have both individual 
and collective dimensions. At an individual level, ensuring integrity means 
ensuring that the data are complete, veri˜ed, and undistorted. This is essential 
for science and engineering to progress, but it is not suf˜cient because progress 
in understanding the world requires that knowledge be shared. This process of 
submitting research data and results derived from those data to the scrutiny of 
others provides for a collective means of establishing and con˜rming data integ
-rity. When others can examine the steps used to generate data and the conclu
-sions drawn from those data, they can judge the validity of the data and results 
and accept (perhaps with reservations) or reject proffered contributions to 
science. Of course, the collective scrutiny of research results cannot
 guarantee 
that those results will be free of error or bias. For instance, it is noteworthy that 
important phenomena such as plate tectonics, chaotic motion in mechanical 
systems, or the functions of ﬁjunkﬂ DNA were overlooked for decades because 
of theoretical perspectives that shaped the collection of data in those ˜elds. 
Nevertheless, by bringing multiple perspectives to bear on a common body of

information, the error and bias inherent in individual perspectives can be mini
-mized. In this way, the frontiers of understanding continually advance through 
the collective evaluation of new data and hypotheses.
Data producers, providers, and users are all involved in the collective scru
-tiny of research data and results. Data producers need to make data available to 
others so that the data™s quality can be judged. (Chapter 3 discusses the acces
-sibility of research data.) Data providers need to make data widely available in 
a form such that the data can be not only used but evaluated, which requires 
that data be accompanied by suf˜cient metadata for their content and value to 
be ascertained. (Chapter 4 discusses the importance of metadata.) Finally, data 
users need to examine critically the data generated by themselves and others. 
The critical evaluation of data is a fundamental obligation of all researchers.
Completely and accurately describing the conditions under which data 
are collected, characterizing the equipment used and its response, and record
-ing anything that was done to the data thereafter are critical to ensuring data 
integrity. In this report we refer to the techniques, procedures, and tools used to 
collect or generate data simply as methods, where a ﬁmethodﬂ is understood to 
encompass everything from research protocols to the computers and software 
(including models, code, and input data) used to gather information, process 
and analyze data, or perform simulations. The validity of the methods used 
to conduct research is judged collectively by the community involved in that 
research. For example, a community may decide that double-blind trials, inde
-pendent veri˜cation, or particular instrumental calibrations are necessary for a 
body of data to be accepted as having high quality. Scienti˜c methods include 
both a core of widely accepted methods and a periphery of methods that are 
less widely accepted. Thus, discussions of data integrity inevitably involve scru
-tiny of the methods used to derive those data.
The procedures used to ensure the integrity of data can vary greatly from 
˜eld to ˜eld. The methods high-energy physicists use to ensure the integrity 
of data are quite different from those of clinical psychologists. The cultures of 
the ˜elds of research are enormously varied, and there are no universal proce
-dures for achieving technical accuracy. Some practices may be employed only 
within speci˜c ˜elds, such as the use of double-blind trials. Some of these ˜eld-
 
speci˜c methods may be embodied in technical manuals, institutional policies, 
journal guidelines, or publications of professional societies. Other methods are 
part of the collective but tacit knowledge held in common by researchers in 
that ˜eld and passed down to beginning researchers through instruction and 
mentoring.
In contrast to ˜eld-speci˜c methods, some methods used to ensure data 
integrity extend across most ˜elds of research. Examples include the review of 
data within research groups, replication of previous observations and experi
-ments, peer review, the sharing of data and research results, and the retention 
of raw data for possible future use.

The importance of understanding the particular methods used (whether 
˜eld-speci˜c or general) is signaled in some publications by a ﬁmethods sectionﬂ 
that describes the procedures used to derive a result. In some print journals, 
methods sections are being squeezed by pressures to cut costs, though conven
-tionally sized or longer methods sections may be available in supplementary 
material online. Researchers also may abbreviate methods sections to keep some 
procedures private in order to obscure the processes used to derive data.
To some extent, researchers must simply trust that other researchers have 
adhered to the methods accepted in a ˜eld of scienti˜c, engineering, or medical 
research. Sometimes it is impossible to specify in enough detail the procedures 
used to gather or generate data so that others will get exactly the same results. 
In such cases, assistance from the original researcher may be necessary for other 
researchers to replicate or extend earlier results.
The importance of understanding the methods of collecting or generating 
the data emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of data. Most 
data cannot be properly interpreted without at least someŠand frequently 
detailedŠunderstanding of the procedures, instruments, and processing used 
to generate those data. Thus, data integrity depends critically on communicat
-ing to other researchers and to the public the context in which data are gener
-ated and processed.
PEER RE
VIEW AND OTHER MEANS FOR ENSURING 
 THE INTEGRITY OF DATA
Of all the social processes used to maintain the integrity of the research 
enterprise, the most prominent is peer review of articles submitted to a schol
-arly journal for publication. Review of submitted articles by the authors™ peers 
screens for quality and relevance and helps to ensure that professional stan
-dards have been maintained in the collection and analysis of data. It provides 
a forum in which the collective standards of a ˜eld can be not only negotiated 
but enforced, because of the researchers™ interests in having their results pub
-lished. Peer review examines whether research questions have been framed and 
addressed properly, whether ˜ndings are original and signi˜cant, and whether 
a paper is clearly written and acknowledges previous work. Peer review also 
organizes research results so that the most important research appears in spe
-ci˜c journals, which allows for more effective communication.
Because peer review is such an effective tool in quality control, it also is 
used in evaluating researchers. Researchers are judged for purposes of hiring 
and promotion largely on the basis of publication in peer-reviewed journals. 
Furthermore, publication in these journals remains the most important way 
to disseminate quality-controlled contributions to knowledge. The number of 
peer-reviewed journals is continuing to grow, and importance of peer review 
has not diminished during the digital era.

However, changes in the way research is conducted, including many 
changes caused by digital technologies, have put pressure on the peer review 
system.
13
 The volume or diversity of research data supporting a conclusion may 
overwhelm the ability of a reviewer to evaluate the link between the data and 
that conclusion. As supporting information for a ˜nding in a submitted paper 
increasingly moves to lengthy supplemental materials, reviewers may be less 
able to judge the merits of a paper. In addition, journals and funders can have 
trouble ˜nding peer reviewers who are competent and have the time to judge 
complex interdisciplinary manuscripts.
Peer review cannot ensure that all research data are technically accu
-rate, though inaccuracies in data can become apparent either in review or as 
researchers seek to extend or build on data. The research system is based to 
a large degree on trust. As described later in this chapter, training and the 
development of standards are crucial factors in building trust. Broader cultural 
forces such as reward systems, the reputation of researchers and their institu
-tions, and social and cultural penalties for violation of trust also serve to build 
and maintain trust.
A recent example that illustrates both the limitations of peer review and 
the strengths of the cumulative nature of science is the case of Seoul National 
University researcher Woo Suk Hwang. Major advances in stem cell technol
-ogy that were reported by Hwang and his colleagues and published in the 
journal 
Science
 were based on fabricated data.
14
 The fraud was uncovered and 
con˜rmed after the original publication because of continued scrutiny of the 
results by the research community. Another case involving fabricated data is 
described in Box 2-2.
Changes in publication practices are affecting peer review. Largely because 
of advances in digital communications, the scholarly publishing industry is 
undergoing dramatic changes, some of which are having a major in˚uence 
on the economics of the industry.
15
 Peer review is expensive because of the 
time devoted to the process by editors, reviewers, and authors responding to 
reviewers™ comments. Changes in the economics of scholarly publishing may 
put pressure on editors and publishers to lessen the emphasis on peer review 
as they strive to cut costs and increase ef˜ciency.
At the same time, digital technologies can strengthen peer review by 
 
catalyzing and facilitating new ways of reviewing publications. For example,

  Breach of Trust
 Beginning in 1998, a series of remarkable papers attracted great attention within 
the condensed-matter physics community. The papers, based largely on work done at 
Bell Laboratories, described methods that could create carbon-based materials with 
long-sought properties, including superconductivity and molecular-level switching. 
However, when other materials scientists sought to reproduce or extend the results, 
they were unsuccessful.
 In 2001, several physicists inside and outside Bell Laboratories began to notice 
anomalies among the papers. Several contained ˚gures that were very similar, even 
though they described different experimental systems. Some graphs seemed too 
smooth to describe real-life systems. Suspicion quickly fell on a young researcher 
named Jan Hendrik Schön, who had helped create the materials, had made the physi
-cal measurements on them, and was a co-author on all the papers.
 Bell Laboratories convened a committee of ˚ve outside scientists to examine 
the results published in 25 papers. Schön, who had conducted part of the work in the 
laboratory where he did his Ph.D. at the University of Konstanz in Germany, told the 
committee that the devices he had studied were no longer running or had been thrown 
away. He also said that he had deleted his primary electronic data ˚les because he did 
not have room to store them on his old computer and that he kept no data notebooks 
while he was performing the work.
 The committee concluded that Schön had engaged in fabrication in at least 16 of 
the 25 papers. Schön was ˚red from Bell Laboratories and later left the United States. 
In a letter to the committee, he wrote that ﬁI admit I made various mistakes in my sci
-enti˚c work, which I deeply regret.ﬂ Yet he maintained that he ﬁobserved experimentally 
the various physical effects reported in these publications.ﬂ
 The committee concluded that Schön acted alone and that his 20 co-authors 
on the papers were not guilty of research misconduct. However, the committee also 
raised the issue of the responsibility that co-authors have to oversee the work of their 
colleagues. The committee concluded that the extent of this responsibility had not 
been established within the research community. The senior author on several of the 
papers, all of which were later retracted, wrote that he should have asked Schön for 
more detailed data and checked his work more carefully, but that he trusted Schön 
to do his work honestly. In response to the incident, Bell Laboratories instituted new 
policies for data retention and internal review of results before publication. It also 
developed a new research ethics statement for its employees.

some journals have been experimenting with making reviews open and public.
16
 In some cases, reviewers™ names are known to authors and readers. In other 
cases, their reviews and authors™ responses become part of the online record 
of publication. More radical innovations, such as the continuous improvement 
of published materials through wikis and similar approaches, or peer rankings 
and commentary on published papers, could further change both journals and 
the institution of peer review.
Although it is clear that traditional peer review processes remain vital for 
evaluating the importance and relevance of research, the advance of digital tech
-nologies is providing new opportunities to ensure the integrity of data. The emer
-gence and growth of accessible databases such as GenBank and the Sloan Digital 
Sky Survey illustrate these opportunities in widely disparate disciplines.
17
Many researchers post databases, draft papers, oral presentations, simula
-tions, software packages, or other scholarly products on personal or institutional 
Web sites. Repositories, such as the Nature Precedings repository established 
by the Nature publishing group for the life sciences, allow researchers to share, 
discuss, and cite preliminary ˜ndings.
18
 The Web allows widespread dissemina
-tion of critiques, commentaries, blogs, and other communications. All of these 
communications can be widely disseminated without undergoing a formal peer 
review process. In these cases, the quality of research results and the underlying 
data may be uncertain, and other researchers may have questions in deciding 
whether to rely on that research in their own work.
The processes for reviewing data that are preserved in a repository or 
otherwise made widely available to researchers can be quite different from the 
procedures for reviewing data presented in a publication.
19
 Trust in the quality 
of data may require personal knowledge of how the data were collected and 
analyzed. Metadata that carefully describe the origins and subsequent process
-ing of the data can increase con˜dence in the validity of the data.
In some cases, digital technologies can assist in ensuring data quality and 
building trust in the integrity of the data. Veri˜ed technical methods for gather

ing, analyzing, and disseminating data can establish tight connections between 
natural phenomena and representations of those phenomena. Digital technolo
-gies also can allow for the widespread dissemination of data and research results 
to potential reviewers and data users. The emergence and growth of accessible 
databases such as GenBank and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey illustrate these 
opportunities in widely disparate disciplines.
20
 (Box 2-3 on clinical research in 
this chapter describes another example.) However, it can be dif˜cult to verify 
the integrity of results based on large datasets that have undergone substantial 
processing.
In cases where research results or underlying data are distributed elec
-tronically without undergoing peer review, researchers may be able to ˜nd 
other ways to submit them to collective evaluation. For example, they may 
be able to submit data to informal review by colleagues or open review by 
users of electronic documents. To advance science, in some cases it may be 
desirable to
 disseminate data and conclusions in ways other than through 
peer-reviewed publications. Electronic technologies are greatly enhancing this 
dissemination.
However, widespread dissemination of research results and underlying 
data that have not been vetted through the social mechanisms characteristic of 
research poses the risk that the conclusions drawn from available data can be 
distorted. Furthermore, it can be dif˜cult for a community to assess the validity 
of evaluations that are outside traditional peer review processes. And academic 
disciplines and institutions are just beginning to develop methods for evaluating 
and rewarding researchers for the production of results that have not under
-gone peer review or have undergone only informal review.
21
Fields of research may settle on methods that enhance the quality of 
research without following all the steps of a formal review process. For exam
-ple, a research community may structure itself to examine and verify research 
procedures and data, even though the data are not publicly accessible, as hap
-pens in high-energy physics. Another example is research in economics, where 
authors often work on papers for extended periods, presenting preliminary 
version of their papers (and data) at conferences and receiving of˜cial critiques 
from their colleagues prior to submitting a paper for publication.
In other cases, the accuracy of data may be continuously reviewed as they 
are incorporated into ongoing research in such a way that their accuracy is 
checked; for example, this is one of the quality control mechanisms used with

 Using Digital Technologies to Enhance Data Integrity
 Digital technologies can pose risks to data integrity, but they also offer ways to 
improve
 the reliability of research data. By enabling phenomena and objects to be 
described and analyzed more comprehensively, they make it possible to remove some 
of the simplifying assumptions inherent in earlier research. They enable researchers to 
build checking and veri˚cation procedures into research protocols in ways that reduce 
the potential for error and bias. Automated data collection that is quality controlled 
can be much more accurate when either substituting for or supplementing human 
observations.
 Although examples from many disciplines could be cited, a good example is the 
use of digital technologies in clinical research, including the conduct of clinical trials 
and plans to link clinical trial information with individuals™ electronic health records.
 Access to the data behind the production of new drugs and other medical treat
-ments is often a contentious issue because of the proprietary traditions of the phar
-maceutical industry and concerns about the privacy and security of patients enrolled 
in clinical trials. Nonetheless, the trend in drug development is toward openness, as 
databases are made more widely available and prepublication information is pub
-lished in electronic form to make signi˚cant ˚ndings quickly available. For example, 
a GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trial Register has been created to afford online access to 
factual summaries of clinical trails of marketed prescription medicines and vaccines.
a Although some specialty journals oppose this practice, the general trend toward open
-ness is being pulled by powerful demands for public assurances about accuracy, 
completeness, and timeliness.
 In the United States the federal government has been the primary force behind 
making drug development data both electronic and public. The Food and Drug Admin
-istration (FDA), for example, is moving away from onsite audits of clinical trials to 
statistically based sampling and electronic audits. The agency is adapting many tools 
borrowed from the banking, nuclear, and other sectors where security checks and 
balances have been in place for a long time.
 An important catalyst for electronic data handling has been the FDA™s issuance 
of regulation 21 CFR Part 11 in 1997,
b which provided criteria for acceptance of 
electronic records and electronic signatures. This regulation not only opened the door 
to electronic submissions but also encouraged the widest possible use of electronic 
technology in all FDA program areas, including data storage, archiving, monitoring, 
auditing, and review. A signi˚cant goal was that data should be shareable between 
sponsors and reviewers.
 In 2004, FDA made electronic submission mandatory and called for electronic 
data handling as well, with the primary goal of faster product reviews and acceptance. 
FDA is currently planning to adopt single standards for the full life cycle of clinical 
 
trials, from the protocol through the capture of source data to analysis, submission, 
and archiving.
 Industry has long been viewed as opposed to making data supporting clinical 
trials or publications public, partly out of a desire to maintain competitive advantages 
and partly out of concern that data could be misjudged, mishandled, or otherwise 
abused in a public forum. This attitude is starting to change as the use of the Internet 
becomes widespread (the accessibility of data is discussed in more detail in the next 
chapter).c The next frontier of the evolution of clinical research toward an electronic future 
is the electronic integration of clinical trials data and patients™ health records. This 
integration is anticipated to open new areas of research that feature enhanced risk 
assessment, improved natural history and epidemiological assessment, more reliable 
information, and better drug use.
 The primary challenge is to develop standards to bridge the different standards 
and terminologies used in clinical trials with those used in medical recordkeeping. This 
process presents daunting dif˚culties, including:

Health records include a broader range of terminology than clinical trials. For 
example, a myocardial infarction might be described in a medical record as coronary 
insuf˚ciency, chest discomfort, or other terms that may be dif˚cult to capture in an 
electronic system.

The codes for most electronic health records were developed for reimburse
-ment and billing purposes, not for clinical use or research.

Health records data are retrospective, which can make it dif˚cult to check for 
errors.
 Questions have been raised about whether digitizing individuals™ electronic health 
records will compromise their security and privacy. Will inappropriate usage be prop
-erly restricted? Will companies be able to acquire and share these data? If companies 
use the data to develop publications, will they later be liable to requests to make 
the primary data available to others? Another potentially dif˚cult problem is that the 
merging of two datasets might make it possible to identify patients who have been 
ﬁde-identi˚edﬂ in each.
 Although these and other potential concerns must be addressed, the experience 
since implementation of 21 CFR Part 11 a decade ago is encouraging. Existing pro
-cesses, standards, and computer systems have been largely effective in maintaining 
the accuracy, integrity, and privacy of data. Furthermore, there are grounds to believe 
that these experiences can be extended to the effective handling of individuals™ elec
-tronic health recordsŠas witnessed, for example, by the success of the U.S. Depart
-ment of Veterans' Affairs in developing secure practices.

The rapid release of validated, high-quality data requires analysis and planning 
by the researchers who built the data-gathering and processing system (which 
requires that those researchers be rewarded for their efforts) and the design of 
systems that incorporate innovative automated data-quality assessment. In these

DATA INTEGRITY IN THE DIGITAL AGE AND 
 THE ROLE OF DATA PROFESSIONALS
In the digital age, the methods used to maintain data integrity are increas
-ingly complex. As new methods and tools are brought into practice,
 researchers are continually challenged to understand them and use them effectively. Further
-more, providing data to users inevitably becomes more involved as the size 
and complexity of databases increase. Because methods continually change as 
digital technologies evolve, researchers may be required to make a substantial 
investment of time in order to keep pace.
In some ˜elds, the researchers themselves may be at the forefront of efforts 
to meet these data challenges, but in many ˜elds the challenges are met at least 
in part by what we call in this report ﬁdata professionals.ﬂ These individuals 
have a very wide range of responsibilities for data analysis, archiving, preserva

22
 Often, they are the leaders in developing new methods 
of data communication, data visualization, educational outreach, and other key 
advances. They also often participate in the development of standards,
 formats, 
metadata, and quality control mechanisms. They can bring new perspectives on 
existing datasets or new ways of combining data that yield important advances. 
Through their familiarity with rapidly changing digital technologies, they can 
enhance the ability of others to conduct research. They also are in a unique posi
-tion to make digital data available to the broadest possible range of researchers, 
educators, students, and the general public. Educational opportunities, viable 
career paths, and professional recognition all help ensure that data

GENERAL PRINCIPLE FOR ENSURING 
 THE INTEGRITY OF RESEARCH DATA
The new capabilities and challenges posed by digital technologies point 
to the need for a renewed emphasis on data integrity. The assumption that 
traditional practices will suf˜ce is no longer tenable as digital technologies 
continue to transform the nature of research. Researchers must be aware of how 
the integration of digital technologies into research affects the quality of data. 
As the generation and dissemination of data become the primary objectives of 
some research projects, researchers need to ˜nd ways to validate the quality of 
those data. They need to take steps to ensure that digital technologies enhance 
rather than detract from data integrity.
These observations lead to the following general principle:
Data Integrity Principle: Ensuring the integrity of research data is essential for 
advancing scienti˜c, engineering, and medical knowledge and for maintaining 
public trust in the research enterprise. Although other stakeholders in the 
research enterprise have important roles to play, researchers themselves are 
ultimately responsible for ensuring the integrity of research data
.In emphasizing the importance of this principle, the committee is not call
-ing for formal assurances of data integrity. Maintaining the quality of research is 
an essential part of being a responsible and competent researcher. In assigning 
researchers the ultimate responsibility for data integrity, the committee is asking 
no more than that researchers adhere to the standards established and held in 
common by all researchers.
This principle may seem apparent, but its application in the digital age 
leads to several important recommendations.
THE OBLIGATIONS OF RESEARCHERS TO ENSURE 
 THE INTEGRITY OF RESEARCH DATA
Researchers have a fundamental obligation to their colleagues, to the pub
-lic, and to themselves to ensure the integrity of research data. Members of the 
research community trust that their colleagues will adhere to the standards of 
their ˜eld and will be transparent in describing the methods used to generate 
data. They also assume that colleagues will make available the data on which 
publicly disseminated research results are based. (Chapter 3 discusses issues of 
data access in detail.) Members of the general public may be unfamiliar with 
the standards of a research ˜eld, but they, too, trust that researchers will gather, 
analyze, and review data accurately, honestly, and without unstated bias. If trust 
among colleagues or the public is misplaced and research data are shown to be 
inaccurate (or, even worse, fabricated), the consequences can be severe both 
within science and in the broader society.

 ENSURING
 THE
 INTEGRITY,
 ACCESSIBILITY,
 AND
 STEWARDSHIP
 OF
 DATA
The twin ideals of trust and transparency lead to our ˜rst recommendation:
Recommendation
 1
: Researchers
 should
 design
 and
 manage
 their
 projects
 so
 as
 to
 ensure
 the
 integrity
 of
 research
 data,
 adhering
 to
 the
 professional
 standards
 that
 distinguish
 scienti˜c,
 engineering,
 and
 medical
 research
 both
 as
 a whole
 and
 as
 their
 particular
 ˜elds
 of
 specialization.
Some professional standards apply throughout research, such as the injunc
-tion never to falsify or fabricate data or plagiarize research results. These are 
fundamental to research, and have been con˜rmed by leading organizations and 
codi˜ed in regulations.
23
 Others are relevant only within speci˜c ˜elds, such as 
requirements to conduct double-blind clinical trials. Researchers must adhere 
to both sets of standards if they are to maintain the integrity of research data.
THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING
The integrity of research data can suffer if researchers inadvertently or will
-fully ignore the professional standards of their ˜eld. Data integrity also can be 
negatively affected if researchers are unaware of these standards or are unaware 
of their importance. 
Recommendation
 2:
 Research
 institutions
 should
 ensure
 that
 every
 researcher
 recei
ves
 appropriate
 training
 in
 the
 responsible
 conduct
 of
 research,
 including
 the
 proper
 management
 of
 research
 data
 in
 general
 and
 within
 the

 ˜eld
 of
 specialization.
 Some
 research
 sponsors
 pro
vide
 support
 for
 this
 training
 and
 for
 the
 de
velopment
 of
 training
 programs.
 The training that is appropriate for researchers varies by ˜eld. While 
every researcher should be familiar with the standards common to all research, 
other standards may be unique to a particular ˜eld. Much of this knowledge is 
handed down from senior researchers to junior researchers during the course of 
a person™s education and research apprenticeship. In at least some ˜elds, a more 
formal statement of accepted practices, combined with more explicit instruc
-tion in those practices, could enhance the quality and utility of the data pro
-duced by those ˜elds. Given the rapid pace of change in many research ˜elds, 
research focused speci˜cally on methods to ensure the integrity of research data 
may be necessary.
Today, the actual implementation of training varies greatly from ˜eld to 
˜eld and institution to institution. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)

requires that graduate and postdoctoral students who are supported by NIH 
training grants receive instruction in the responsible conduct of research. The 
Of˜ce of Research Integrity at the Department of Health and Human Ser
-vices supports programs undertaken by the Council of Graduate Schools, the 
National Postdoctoral Association, and the Laboratory Management Institute 
at the University of California at Davis to develop education and training pro
-grams in the responsible conduct of research.
24
 Many research institutions also 
require such training of students or beginning researchers, often in the form 
of seminars, workshops, or Web-based modules. (Box 2-4 describes one such 
program.) 
A 2002 Institute of Medicine report examined how institutions can cre
-ate environments that foster research integrity.
25
 The report points out that 
although education and training can be helpful, not much is currently known 
about which approaches are most effective. Institutional self-assessment and 
external peer review can be valuable tools in developing and improving educa
-tion and training. Smaller institutions may need to take advantage of consortia 
or electronic communications to provide their researchers with adequate educa
-tion and training.
The leaders of research groups have a particular responsibility to see that 
professional standards are observed in the conduct of research. They should 
ensure that the members of their groups have opportunities to learn about the 
proper management of data. Research leaders also have an obligation to set 
a standard for responsible behavior and to monitor and guide the actions of 
the members of their groups. Implementing institutional policies at the group 
level, holding regular meetings to discuss data issues, and providing careful 
 
supervision all help to create a research environment in which the integrity of 
data is understood, valued, and ensured.
26
As described earlier, the need for training in the standards of research has 
been made more urgent by the advance of the digital age. The application of 
digital technologies in research has fundamentally altered the daily practices 
and interpersonal interactions of everyone involved in the research enterprise. 
Researchers need to become familiar with complex and rapidly changing sys
-tems to review, visualize, store, summarize, and search for information. They 
need to understand the technologies and methods they apply to the collection, 
analysis, storage, and dissemination of data in suf˜cient detail to have con˜
-dence in the integrity of those data. Unless they understand the procedures 
used to generate, process, represent, and document data, they risk wasting

 Training in Data Management
 The program Fostering Integrity in Research, Scholarship, and Teaching (FIRST) 
at the University of Minnesota includes an online workshop in research data manage
-ment. New faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students who are 
acting as principal investigators or otherwise have responsibility for the management 
of data are required to take the workshop, which takes about an hour to complete.
 The workshop is organized around four online case studies in the following 
areas: ensuring data reliability, controlling access to data, maintaining data integrity, 
and following retention guidelines. The case study on data retention, for example, is 
the following:
A group of scientists gathered new research data and published their ˚nd
-ings. This exciting research led to a rethinking of some fundamental aspects 
of superconductivity, and generated a signi˚cant amount of discussion. About 
3 years after the original publication date, however, a suggestion for a different 
interpretation of the data was made. To prove that the initial interpretation was 
correct, the principal investigator (PI) from the project decided to reevaluate 
the data taken 5 years earlier. Unfortunately, the raw data had been destroyed 
after they were entered into the computer, and the computer ˚les were thrown 
out with the computer 1 year ago.
Each case study is followed by a series of questions to answer and links to additional 
information. Pages that provide answers to frequently asked questions and an oppor
-tunity to send additional questions to experts in the responsible conduct of research 
provide additional resources.

profession so dependent on advanced computing and communications, every 
researcher needs to understand not only how to use computers but how com

 STANDARDS FOR DATA INTEGRITY: 
 A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESEARCH ENTERPRISE
Researchers, research institutions, research sponsors, professional
 societies, 
and journals all are responsible for creating and sustaining an environment 
that supports the efforts of researchers to ensure the integrity of research 
data. In some cases, digital technologies are having such a dramatic effect on

 The research enterprise needs to redouble efforts to set 
clear expectations for appropriate behavior and effectively communicate those 
expectations.

 To date, research communities have responded to the new challenges of 
the digital age in a largely decentralized fashion, adapting traditional ethical 
standards to new circumstances. This decentralized approach is appropriate in 
that data management practices are so varied across research ˜elds that a ﬁone 
size ˜ts allﬂ approach would not address important issues, and the imposition 
of detailed standards from outside a ˜eld is unlikely to be effective. In some 
cases, ˜elds of research within and across disciplines may be able to cooperate 
in developing standards for ensuring the integrity of research data.
The application of professional standards can be complicated in the case 
of interdisciplinary research, where investigators in different ˜elds bring differ
-ent practices to joint projects. In this case, familiarity with the standards and 
expectations of all the ˜elds represented by that research is preferable to the 
blanket imposition of overly broad standards. Better education and training in 
data management for investigators, combined with expanded access to research 
data across disciplines (which is the subject of the next chapter), will best serve 
the advance of knowledge and other public interests.
THE ROLES OF DATA PROFESSIONALS
Although all researchers should understand digital technologies well 
enough to be con˜dent in the integrity of the data they generate, they cannot 
always be expected to be able to take full advantage of new capabilities. Instead, 
they may have to rely on collaborations with colleagues who have specialized 
training in applying digital technologies in research. Through their in-depth 
knowledge of digital technologies and how those technologies can advance

Data professionals have a wide range of backgrounds, levels of training, 
and roles in research. Some serve in a support role for research groups; others 
make substantial intellectual or other contributions to research that warrant 
professional rewards such as inclusion in a list of authors. The roles of data 
professionals vary from ˜eld to ˜eld, but in an increasing number of ˜elds, data 
professionals are assuming a shared professional responsibility with research
-ers for maintaining the integrity of research data. Chapters 3 and 4 return to 
the roles of data professionals in enabling access to and preserving research 
data. The following recommendation re˚ects their importance in ensuring data

Ensuring the Integrity, Accessibility, and Stewardship of Research Data in the Digital AgeCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.3Ensuring Access to Research Data
The advance of knowledge is based on the open ˚ow of information. Only 
when a researcher shares data and results with other researchers can the accuracy 
of the data, analyses, and conclusions be veri˜ed. Different researchers apply their 
own perspectives to the same body of information, which reduces the bias inherent 
in individual perspectives. Unrestricted access to the data used to derive conclu
-sions also builds public con˜dence in the processes and outcomes of research.
Furthermore, scienti˜c, engineering, and medical research is a cumulative 
process. New ideas build on earlier knowledge, so that the frontiers of human 
understanding continually move outward. Researchers use each other™s data 
and conclusions to extend their own ideas, making the total effort much greater 
than the sum of the individual efforts. Openness speeds and strengthens the 
advance of human knowledge. As an example, Box 3-1 describes how the shar
-ing of genomic data has advanced life sciences research.
Finally, only by sharing research data and the results of research can new 
knowledge be transformed into socially bene˜cial goods and services. When 
research information is readily accessible, researchers and other innovators can 
use that information to create products and services that meet human needs 
and expand human capabilities. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) describes a new effort to enhance public access to 
research data (see Box 3-2). According to this approach, ﬁOpenness means 
access on equal terms for the international research community at the lowest 
possible cost, preferably at no more than the marginal cost of dissemination. 
Open access to research data from public funding should be easy, timely, user-
friendly and preferably Internet-based.ﬂ

 Access to Genomic Data
 In biology, the culture of research and the applications of digital technologies 
have traditionally been heterogeneous, independent, and dispersed. However, the 
growth of interdisciplinary research, the advent of projects that have generated large 
volumes of data, and the invention of data-intensive devices such as DNA micr
oarrays 
and high-throughput sequencers have highlighted the increasing importance of digiti
-zation of the biomedical sciences.
a In the ˚eld of genomics, strong forces have pushed in the direction of unrestricted 
access to data, including directives from funding agencies, requirements from jour
-nals that researchers submit data to public repositories, community expectations, 
and the development of powerful data-sharing systems such as PubMed. In the case 
of the human genome, for example, the desire by funding agencies, researchers, and 
the general public for public access to research data led the genomics research com
-munity to develop an ethic of unrestricted access. This ethic was formally adopted as 
the ﬁBermuda statementﬂ in February 1996: 
All human genomic information produced at large-scale sequencing centres 
should be freely available and in the public domain, in order to encourage 
research and development and to maximize its bene˚t to society.
b At the same time, other forces have had the effect of restricting access to
 genomics 
data, including:

The need to protect patient or individual privacy;

The principal investigator™s desire to maintain research advantage;

The danger of misuse (e.g., of virus sequences);

A pro˚t motive (for data with potential commercial value);

The tendency to ﬁpublish and forgetﬂ used data, especially supplementary 
data. The generation of complete genome sequences for a growing number of organ
-isms has intensi˚ed the digitization of biomedical research. These data have many 
applications in both basic and applied research, with the lines between the two often 
being dif˚cult to discern. For example, computational processing and reference to 
information and knowledge bases about organisms and disease processes allow 
researchers to reach faster conclusions about the likely results of a therapy.
c The 
combination of cellular data, genomic pro˚ling, and biological simulation may reduce 
the failure rate of drug candidates and the cost of testing. In the near future, it will even 
be possible, given suf˚cient computing and storage resources, to record the genotype 
of each person in a secure database. Variations in genes may indicate speci˚c disease 
susceptibility or responses to known drug types. This information could enable physi
-cians to prescribe a personal immunization and screening schedule or to recommend 
speci˚c preventive measures for each patient.
 Further integration of the biomedical sciences using digital technologies could 
allow independent investigators to remain the engine of innovative research by par
-ticipating in ﬁvirtual team science.ﬂ Early examples of such ﬁcyberinfrastructureﬂŠ
 
including the Biomedical Informatics Research Network, myGrid, and the cancer Bio
-medical Informatics GridŠindicate that it is technically feasible, if not easy, to integrate 
the many threads of biomedicine. The challenge is to ensure that new ﬁcybersilosﬂ do 
not replace existing disciplinary and institutional silos.

 Access to Genomic Data
 In biology, the culture of research and the applications of digital technologies 
have traditionally been heterogeneous, independent, and dispersed. However, the 
growth of interdisciplinary research, the advent of projects that have generated large 
volumes of data, and the invention of data-intensive devices such as DNA micr
oarrays 
and high-throughput sequencers have highlighted the increasing importance of digiti
-zation of the biomedical sciences.
a In the ˚eld of genomics, strong forces have pushed in the direction of unrestricted 
access to data, including directives from funding agencies, requirements from jour
-nals that researchers submit data to public repositories, community expectations, 
and the development of powerful data-sharing systems such as PubMed. In the case 
of the human genome, for example, the desire by funding agencies, researchers, and 
the general public for public access to research data led the genomics research com
-munity to develop an ethic of unrestricted access. This ethic was formally adopted as 
the ﬁBermuda statementﬂ in February 1996: 
All human genomic information produced at large-scale sequencing centres 
should be freely available and in the public domain, in order to encourage 
research and development and to maximize its bene˚t to society.
b At the same time, other forces have had the effect of restricting access to
 genomics 
data, including:

The need to protect patient or individual privacy;

The principal investigator™s desire to maintain research advantage;

The danger of misuse (e.g., of virus sequences);

A pro˚t motive (for data with potential commercial value);

The tendency to ﬁpublish and forgetﬂ used data, especially supplementary 
data. The generation of complete genome sequences for a growing number of organ
-isms has intensi˚ed the digitization of biomedical research. These data have many 
applications in both basic and applied research, with the lines between the two often 
being dif˚cult to discern. For example, computational processing and reference to 
information and knowledge bases about organisms and disease processes allow 
researchers to reach faster conclusions about the likely results of a therapy.
c The 
combination of cellular data, genomic pro˚ling, and biological simulation may reduce 
the failure rate of drug candidates and the cost of testing. In the near future, it will even 
be possible, given suf˚cient computing and storage resources, to record the genotype 
of each person in a secure database. Variations in genes may indicate speci˚c disease 
susceptibility or responses to known drug types. This information could enable physi
-cians to prescribe a personal immunization and screening schedule or to recommend 
speci˚c preventive measures for each patient.
 Further integration of the biomedical sciences using digital technologies could 
allow independent investigators to remain the engine of innovative research by par
-ticipating in ﬁvirtual team science.ﬂ Early examples of such ﬁcyberinfrastructureﬂŠ
 
including the Biomedical Informatics Research Network, myGrid, and the cancer Bio
-medical Informatics GridŠindicate that it is technically feasible, if not easy, to integrate 
the many threads of biomedicine. The challenge is to ensure that new ﬁcybersilosﬂ do 
not replace existing disciplinary and institutional silos.

journals require the submission and public dissemination of the data supporting 
an accepted manuscript. Funding agencies and research institutions also have 
policies that require the open sharing of the data on which research conclusions 
are based. Codes of conduct in a research community, whether explicit or tacit, 
can exert a powerful in˚uence on researchers to make data accessible.

 OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to 
 Research Data from Public Funding
 From 2004 to 2006 the 30-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) developed a set of guidelines based on commonly agreed 
principles to facilitate cost-effective access to digital research data generated through 
public funding. Endorsed by the OECD Council on December 14, 2006, the ﬁOECD 
Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Fundingﬂ serve as 
objectives for each member country to achieve given its own legal, cultural, economic, 
and social context.
 The Principles and Guidelines cover 13 broad areas:
 Openness Flexibility
 Transparency
 Legal conformity
 Protection of intellectual property
 Formal responsibility
 Professionalism
 Interoperability
 Quality Security
 Ef˚ciency Accountability Sustainability The Principles and Guidelines call ﬁfor a ˜exible approach to data accessﬂ under 
a default principle of openness and recognize ﬁthat one size does not ˚t all.ﬂ They also 
state that ﬁWhatever differences there may be between practices of, and policies on, 
data sharing, and whatever legitimate restrictions may be put on data access, practi
-cally all research could bene˚t from more systematic sharing.ﬂ

occurs, researchers are organizing their work in new ways to take advantage 
of new possibilities. An innovative example is the conduct of research in what 
can be called an open-knowledge environment.

the identi˜cation of a problem that is to be examined in a public forum on the 
Internet. Researchers from different disciplines, organizations, and countries 
then can all contribute to solving the problem, with the open sharing of data 
and ideas that might bear on that problem. An open-knowledge environment 
allows people with many different backgrounds and viewpoints to interact 
in a relatively unstructured way while moving toward a common objective. 
The free ˚ow of information speeds progress, while the global reach of the 
Internet greatly expands the number and breadth of researchers who can con
-tribute to a project. Another approach to sharing is open-notebook science.
5 Similarly, blogs, wikis, and other forms of electronic interaction are tools that 
enable collaborative work on common problems in a generally open research 
environment.
In the context of this report, sharing research data enhances the data™s integ
-rity by allowing other researchers to scrutinize and verify them (as described in 
the Chapter 2). Sharing also increases the likelihood that data will be preserved 
for long-term uses, although the stewardship of data requires more than that 
the data be accessible (as described in the Chapter 4). Thus, the three themes 
of this reportŠintegrity, accessibility, and stewardshipŠare intertwined.
BARRIERS TO SHARING DATA
Despite the many bene˜ts to be gained by the sharing of research data and 
results, even a cursory survey of research activity reveals many circumstances 
in which access to data is limited.
Because researchers require time to verify data, analyze their data, and 
derive research conclusions, individual researchers generally are not expected 
to make all their data public immediately. Individual researchers need latitude 
to follow hunches, experiment with methods, explore conjectures, and make 
mistakes. New tools for automatically assessing the quality of data and sharing 
them with others can facilitate the rapid sharing of digital data, although verify
-ing the reliability of these tools presents its own set of challenges. 
Once a research result is published, the norms of scienceŠand often the 
terms of the research grant or contractŠcall for the supporting data to be 
accessible. Researchers may nevertheless try to keep the data private, perhaps 
to derive additional results without competition from others, for the exclusive 
use of a student or postdoctoral fellow whose career would be advanced by 
generating further papers, or just to avoid the effort to put the data in usable 
form for others. In the worst cases, they may retain data to hide acts of research 
misconduct or to conceal defects in the dataset.
The norms of a research community may allow keeping data private for 
a certain period. These norms can be formalized through the terms of a grant

giving the investigator a de˜ned period of exclusive use of the data, with the 
exclusivity ending upon the publication of results, after a particular length of 
time, or when data are deposited in a data center or archive. 
There is great variation among research ˜elds in their data-sharing norms, 
to such an extent that different ˜elds can be said to have different data cultures. 
(Box 3-3 describes aspects of the data culture in economics.) A recent report 
commissioned by the Research Information Network of the United Kingdom 
examined data-sharing practices and expectations across a number of ˜elds 
(Table 3-1).
6 The report highlights the global importance and relevance of data 
accessibility in research, as well as the fact that differences between ˜elds are 
often more important than national differences in determining data-sharing 
practices. The international aspects of data access and sharing are discussed in 
more detail below.
Observational astronomy offers a good example of the data-sharing 
norms that can characterize a ˜eld of research. Astronomical data often can 
be used for multiple purposes and are usually made public, but proprietary 
periods in which only the members of a research team have access to data 
are common. The European Southern Observatory (Europe™s large optical 
observatory) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have 
12-month proprietary periods. The U.S. National Optical Astronomy Obser
-vatory has an 18-month proprietary time. These periods provide researchers 
with an opportunity to make discoveries as a reward for dedicating signi˜cant 
periods of their careers to creating new facilities and developing new tech
-niques. They also provide an opportunity for critical evaluation of the data 
before they are released.
In the high-energy physics community, collaborations are so large and the 
experiments so complexŠwith hundreds of scientists involved with the opera
-tion of a single detectorŠthat it could take years for an independent scientist to 
learn enough to reanalyze the data. The data of each collaboration are treated as 
proprietary. Other groups that want to undertake the same measurement must 
form their own large collaboration and repeat the experiment. As explained in 
Box 2-1, large collaborations in high-energy physics involve elaborate proce
-dures for internal scrutiny of and validation of data.
Cultural norms and expectations in research ˜elds regarding data can 
change over time. For example, as data sharing has proven increasingly valuable 
to the advancement of research in many areas of the life sciences, researchers, 
sponsors, research institutions, and other stakeholders have built new infra
-structure and established guidelines to facilitate data sharing. A 2003 National 
Research Council study (Box 3-4) recommended guidelines for the sharing of

 Data Sharing Within Economics
 Economists rely on an enormous variety of research dataŠfor instance, adminis
-trative data from government records, datasets provided by companies to the federal 
government, or data provided directly to researchers by companies. Some economists 
rely on methods similar to those used by anthropologists, in which large quantities 
of data are collected and analyzed. Often the datasets are subject to con˚dentiality 
agreements because individuals could be identi˚ed from the data. Use of the data may 
even be restricted to ﬁenclaves,ﬂ where a researcher has to work on a nonnetworked 
computer in a secure room from which materials cannot be removed.
 Analysis of economic data may depend critically on highly complex computer 
programs. These programs, rather than the actual data, can be the most valuable part 
of an economist™s research, because many datasets are available publicly, whereas a 
computer program could embody months or years of individual effort. Thus, to assess 
the original analysis, other researchers often need access to the computer programs 
as well as to the original data.
 As in other sciences, the social sciences have an expectation of reproducibil
-ityŠthat if the data are available and analyzed with the same assumptions, the same 
results will emerge. But without considerable assistance from the original researchers, 
actual replication of published results in economics can be time-consuming, tedious, 
and subject to many errors. Furthermore, journals are reluctant to publish studies that 
are con˚rmatory rather than groundbreaking. Social scientists, like other scientists, 
are more interested in doing their own studies and getting credit for something new 
than in repeating work that has already been done.
 Even if replication is not common, the data should be available to enable replica
-tion, but in economics this often is not the case.
a Several years ago two economists 
wrote to the authors of every paper in the March 2004 issue of the 
American Economic 
Review
, a leading journal in the ˚eld,
 and requested the data to replicate the research. 
Although the journal has a statement saying ﬁAuthors are required to maintain their 
data and supply it to other researchers upon request,ﬂ 14 of the 15 sets of authors to 
whom the economists wrote said that they did not have the data or would not share 
them. The authors summarized their ˚ndings in an article and submitted it to the 
American Economic Review
, which published their paper.
 As a result of this and other cases, the 
American Economic Review
 adopted a new 
policy. For published articles, the authors must provide both the data and the programs 
suf˚cient for the articles™ ˚ndings to be replicated. These data and programs are then 
posted on the journal™s Web site. If the use of the data is restricted, the authors must 
provide instructions on how to obtain permission to use the data. If some of the data 
are proprietary, the editors try to work out ways for other researchers to use the data. 
In addition, the journal is encouraging studies to reanalyze data and replicate results.
 The 
American Economic Review
 is supported by dues from 20,000 members and 
has the resources to institute such a policy, whereas journals with fewer resources 
could have dif˚culty adopting and enforcing the same or similar policies. Also, the data 
and programs are not requested at the time of submission of an articleŠonly upon 
acceptanceŠso that the 92 percent of the papers submitted to the journal that are 
rejected do not fall under the new guidelines. Some economists have decided not to 
submit a paper to the 
American Economic Review
 because they do not want to release 
their data or software. Nevertheless, because authors want to publish their papers in 
the journal, it has considerable in˜uence over their actions.

 Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials
 In 2003 the National Research Council Committee on Responsibilities of Author
-ship in the Biological Sciences released a report that focused directly on the issues 
discussed in this chapter. In that report, the committee established what it called ﬁthe 
uniform principle for sharing integral data and materials expeditiouslyﬂ (UPSIDE). They 
described this principle as follows:
Community standards for sharing publication-related data and materials should 
˜ow from the general principle that the publication of scienti˚c information is 
intended to move science forward. More speci˚cally, the act of publishing is a 
quid pro quo
 in which authors receive credit and acknowledgment in exchange 
for disclosure of their scienti˚c ˚ndings. An author™s obligation is not only to 
release data and materials to enable others to verify or replicate published ˚nd
-ings (as journals already implicitly or explicitly require) but also to provide them 
in a form on which other scientists can build with further research. All members 
of the scienti˚c communityŠwhether working in academia, government, or a 
commercial enterpriseŠhave equal responsibility for upholding community 
standards as participants in the publication system, and all should be equally 
able to derive bene˚ts from it.
 The committee also identi˚ed ˚ve corollary principles associated with sharing 
publication-related data, software, and materials. For example, the committee stated 
that ﬁauthors should include in their publications the data, algorithms, or other infor
-mation that is central or integral to the publicationŠthat is, whatever is necessary to 
support the major claims of the paper and would enable one skilled in the art to verify 
or replicate the claims.ﬂ
 The committee noted that its purview extended only to the biological sciences. It 
also stated, however, that ﬁin the committee™s view, there should be a single scienti˚c 
community that operates under a single set of principles regarding the pursuit of 
knowledge. This includes a common ethic with regard to the integrity of the scienti˚c 
process and a long-held commitment to the validation of concepts of experimentation 
and later veri˚cation or refutation of published observations.ﬂ

related to human subjects from our study, it is important to note that these 
issues can act as barriers to data access. Some data are not released because 
of con˜dentiality or privacy considerations, such as data related to biomedical 
research or the social sciences. For example, the 1996 Health Insurance Por
-tability and Accountability Act established rules for disclosure of individually 
identi˜able health information (known as protected health information, or 
PHI).
8 If PHI is used in research, the researcher must comply with regulations 
regarding its use and storage in the project. There are instances where PHI may 
be disclosed, but the need to support published research is not among them. 
For PHI to be made publicly available, a subject must agree to the disclosure 
of the information.
For some medical research data, privacy and con˜dentiality obstacles can 
be overcome by removing identi˜ers prior to the private sharing of data or the 
public release of data. However, this remains an area of ongoing concern and 
investigation. Efforts are now under way to make medical research data avail
-able while ensuring that the data cannot be used to identify individuals.
Research data also can be kept private because they pertain to intelligence, 
military, or terrorist activities.
9 Examples include research related to nuclear, 
radiological, and biological threats; human and agricultural health systems; 
chemicals and explosives; and information technology infrastructure. National 
Security Decision Directive 189 (NSDD 189), which was issued by President 
Ronald Reagan in 1985, states that the policy of the U.S. government is not to 
restrict, to the maximum extent possible, the products of unclassi˜ed funda
-mental research.
10
 The challenge to policy makers and researchers is where to 
draw the line between classi˜ed and unclassi˜ed information and how to bal
-ance restrictions on access to sensitive information with the potential costs of 
such restrictions.
Our committee was not asked to examine national security issues in depth. 
Other National Research Council committees, including the Committee on Sci
-enti˜c Communication and National Security (CSCANS), are directly focused 
on issues such as classi˜ed information, export controls, and nonimmigrant visa 
policies. A recent CSCANS report points out that many federal government 
policies and practices since the September 11 attacks have effectively reversed 
NSDD 189.

69ensure that the small risks of basic research being misused are balanced with the 
enormous bene˜ts that accrue from the free exchange of information. Another 
National Research Council Committee examined the national security implica
-tions of access to genomic databases and found that unrestricted access, com
-bined with the development of education programs by professional societies, is 
the best approach to balancing the advancement of knowledge with protecting 
the public from misuse of genomic data for bioterrorism threats.
12
 The federal 
government™s creation in 2008 of a new categoryŠﬁControlled Unclassi˜ed 
InformationﬂŠillustrates that restrictions on the sharing of research based 
on national security concerns will continue to pose challenges to the research 
enterprise.
13
When research is carried out or sponsored by public agencies, the general 
presumption in the United States is that data generated as part of that research 
should be publicly available.
14
 Different considerations apply for research funded 
by a private company, whether that research occurs within a company or in the 
academic sector. Though some companies have been experimenting with the 
bene˜ts of freely sharing results from proprietary research,
15
 many companies 
carefully guard this information as a trade secret and a potential source of com
-mercial advantage. Similarly, an academic researcher may temporarily withhold 
data in order to ˜le a patent or develop a commercial product, even when the 
research is publicly funded. These issues are discussed later in this chapter.
The cost of disseminating data can be a barrier to its use. Circular A-130 
from the Of˜ce of Management and Budget (OMB) stipulates that
 government-
generated data should be available to users at cost suf˜cient to recover the 
expense of dissemination but not higher.
16
 However, data from private sources, 
even when purchased by the federal government for research purposes, fre
-quently have high distribution costs and restrictions on redistribution. These 
costs can be a signi˜cant problem for academic researchers who need access to 
large databases for modeling or data analysis.
Finally, research data may be kept private because the resources are lack
-ing to make data collections available to the public. A project might generate 
data that could be valuable to researchers in the same or other ˜elds, but the

investigators who generated those data may not have the resources or capabili
-ties needed to make them available. This is frequently the case in small-scale 
research that does not have funding set aside for such functions or does not 
have a robust data management component in place. Alternatively, the data may 
be available, but the essential metadata needed to understand and use those 
data may be missing, making the data useless for anyone outside the immediate 
research team.
In general, researchers have a strong incentive to release the results of 
research. Their own recognition and advancement in their ˜eld generally 
depend on public dissemination of those results. In contrast, researchers have 
traditionally had few incentives to make publicly available the data they gener
-ate in the course of research. However, those data may have great value for 
other researchers, and making data publicly accessible can speed the advance 
of knowledge.
THE COSTS OF LIMITING ACCESS TO DATA
Barriers that restrict access to data, such as withholding data or delaying 
their release, can result in substantial costs.
17
 Once data have been gathered 
from an instrument or compiled from other sources, it is obviously more cost-
effective to share the data than to reconstruct or recompile them. Furthermore, 
resources spent accessing data then are not available for other research uses.
Limitations on research data also can be barriers to innovation, which 
incurs costs in the broader society.
18
 In today™s economy, the creation of new 
goods and services often depends on access to research data. When access is 
withheld, economic innovation slows, reducing the returns to investments in 
research.
Limiting access to research data also hinders the kinds of interdisciplinary 
and international cooperation that has proven so productive in recent research. 
When data are restricted to a particular research team or ˜eld, other researchers 
not only cannot use the data but often cannot even ascertain the value of those 
data to their own research. Similarly, if students are unable to work with new 
research data, their education and training may be adversely affected.
Limitations on the accessibility of data invariably retard, and can even 
block, the process of verifying the accuracy of those data. As a result, the quality 
of the data could be lower than would be the case if they were freely available, 
again reducing the return on the investment in producing the data.
Finally, researchers who are deprived of access to data are disadvantaged 
in conducting research and possibly seeking support to do research. This

problem can be particularly acute in developing countries, where lack of access 
to data from developed countries can stymie not only the development of 
research capacity but advances in economic productivity, public health, and 
well-being.
DATA ACCESS ISSUES IN RESEARCH AFFECTING 
 PUBLIC POLICY OR PRI
VATE INTERESTS
Restricting access to data can be costly and wasteful, but there also are 
circumstances in which providing access to data can entail substantial costs 
and waste. There are situations in which responding to requests for data could 
actually slow the progress of research, and there have been instances in which 
requests for data have been intended to inhibit research.
It is not uncommon for a small research group to lack the resources to 
make data readily accessible. Especially as data collections grow in size and 
complexity, small groups may have dif˜culty providing data to other
 researchers 
in the same ˜eld, much less making data readily accessible to researchers in 
˜elds less directly connected to the research, or to the public.
Access to data can also become an issue of contention in cases where 
research has important implications for public policy or has a potential for 
affecting private interests in such areas as the environment or health. An early 
example was the case of Paul Fischer, who was subpoenaed in the early 1990s 
by a tobacco company after publication of his research showing widespread 
recognition among young children of the ﬁJoe Camelﬂ character used in ciga
-rette advertising.
19
 Fischer initially was subpoenaed in a lawsuit to which he was 
not subject. In addition to requesting details about the research that would be 
considered reasonable and necessary to replicate the results, the subpoena con
-tained more problematic demands, such as personal details about the subjects. 
According to his own account, Fischer™s institution, the Medical College of 
Georgia, refused to provide legal support. After Fischer, using his own
 attorney, 
had quashed the subpoena, the Medical College of Georgia™s counsel wrote 
an article that had the effect of alerting R.J. Reynolds to an alternative legal 
mechanism, the Georgia Open Records Act. Under this act, Fischer ultimately 
was compelled to turn over all the information except the children™s names.
Perhaps the most famous recent example involved a research project to 
reconstruct global temperature trends over the last two millennia. A 1998 
paper by Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University and two co-authors 
made extensive use of proxy studies in which paleoclimatic conditions were 
inferred from measurements of tree rings, sediments, coral, glaciers, oxygen 
isotopes, and other phenomena, concluding that global surface temperatures

were relatively stable for 900 years and then rose rapidly between 1900 and 
2000, providing a ˜ngerprint for human-caused climate change.
20
 After the release of the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change that cited this ˜nding in 2001, it became a point of 
contention in debates over the reality and causes of global warming. Mann 
resisted when researchers skeptical of his work requested access to the underly
-ing data and computer programs used in the reconstruction, and controversy 
ensued.
21
 Two Members of the U.S. House of Representatives issued a letter 
requesting a wide variety of information from each of the three co-authors of 
the paper, giving them 18 days to provide, among other things, a curriculum 
vitae with a list of all studies they authored on climate change and the speci˜c 
sources of funding; a list of all ˜nancial support received from private, state 
and federal sources for climate-related work; the location of all underlying data 
archives related to such research and its speci˜c availability; correspondence 
regarding requests for such data from other researchers, responses to such 
requests and the researchers™ reasons for their decisions, and in-depth responses 
to inquiries about their work on bristlecone pines and the Intergovernmental 
Panel on
 Climate Change.
22
 This request was viewed by some as intimidation.
23
 The National Research Council released a study in 2006 that examined the rap
-idly emerging ˜eld of multiproxy paleoclimate studies.
24
 The report ultimately 
af˜rmed some, but not all, of the key results of Mann™s work, while stating that 
ﬁall research bene˜ts from full and open access to published datasets and . . . a 
clear explanation of analytical methods is mandatory.ﬂ The report also points to 
the need for researchers, professional societies, journals, and research sponsors 
involved in paleoclimate research to improve access to data and methods.
25
 This is not an isolated example of a research ˜eld with highly charged 
policy implications. Research data and ˜ndings have a substantial in˚uence 
on a growing number of issues, ranging from arms control to air quality, 
endangered species, environmental toxins, and school vouchers.

 In many 
of these cases, researchers are being asked to contribute information in areas

where government has responsibility for public health and well-being, such as 
environmental quality regulations or the legal responsibility of manufacturers 
for product harms. In these areas, the role of research is increasingly being 
challenged by those who oppose particular regulations, laws, or legal rulings.
27
 These cases raise important and dif˜cult questions: When are researchers 
justi˜ed in withholding underlying data and methods? What recourse do col
-leagues, policy makers, and the public have when data or methods underlying 
research on important policy issues are withheld? What is the line between 
harassment that unreasonably slows the pace of research and justi˜ed requests 
for information? 
These trends point to the need for clearer standards and understand
-ings between researchers, their employers, and the public about the overarch
-ing value of openness, as well as the circumstances under which requests or 
demands for data are reasonable and when they cross the line into the realm 
of harassment that can slow the advance of knowledge. There are important 
and complex questions about how to balance the need for important data to be 
widely accessible, with fundamental issues of academic freedom,
 con˜dentiality, 
and the need for researchers to carry out their studies free of harassment, 
intimidation, or outside pressure.
OWNERSHIP OF RESEARCH DATA AND RELATED PRODUCTS
Addressing the question of ﬁwho owns research dataﬂ is a key element of 
the authoring committee™s charge. There is a range of possible answers, includ
-ing the researcher, the institution, the sponsor, or nobody, depending on the 
particular meaning of ﬁownershipﬂ and the context. This section will review 
the laws and policies relevant to the ownership of research data and related 
rights to control its dissemination and use. The next section will cover other 
laws and policies related to research data, focusing on obligations to keep or 
share data.
To begin with, general principles of property law apply to the media on 
which data are stored and may also apply to the bits themselves in the case of 
digital data. One analogy is to the master recording in the music business when 
analog technology dominated. The owner of the master tape has a property right 
in the object but does not necessarily own the copyright that controls the copy
-ing and distribution of the data stored in the recording. Similarly, the researcher, 
his or her institution, or the sponsor (depending on the terms of the research 
grant or contract) may own the medium on which the data are stored. 
More important, for the purposes of this discussion, than ownership of 
the physical storage media are intellectual property rights in a database (some

speci˜c arrangement or organization of the data), in a publication whose central 
ideas are based on the data, or in an invention that is based on the data. We will 
consider each of these related issues in turn.
Copyright, Database Protections, and Licensing
In the United States, copyright protection is extended to ﬁoriginal works 
of authorship ˜xed in any tangible medium of expression. . . .ﬂ
28
 Copyright 
holders enjoy the exclusive right to disseminate their creations and to earn a 
pro˜t by selling or licensing them. Raw data and other facts, however, are not 
protected as copyrightable subject matter. Databases are copyrightable if the 
selections or arrangement are original; the mere compilation of facts or data 
into a collection does not entitle them to protection. These provisions were 
reinforced by the 1991 Supreme Court ruling in 
Feist
 Publications,
 Inc.
 v
. Rural
 Telephone
 Ser
vice
 Co.
, which limited copyright protection for databases 
to those arranged and selected in an original manner.
29
 In addition, the federal 
government is prohibited from exerting copyright protection over its own 
publications, including data generated by government entities. Finally, copy
-right law includes provisions for ﬁfair useﬂ exceptions in which portions of a 
copyrighted work may be used without permission in teaching, research, and 
other speci˜ed pursuits. 
This basic framework has served to support the open ˚ow of research 
data. Federal agencies have been central in sustaining a strong public domain 
in data.
30
 With regard to research data, private companies and nonpro˜t enti
-ties play an important role in creating databases and information services that 
are utilized by researchers. The existence of copyright protection for creative 
and original data collections provides an incentive for investments in valuable 
products and services in the private sector. 
Digital technologies have introduced new considerations into copyright laws 
and enforcement.
31
 Technological barriers to violating copyrights have fallen, 
posing challenges to copyright-based industries such as music, newspapers, and 
motion pictures. Before the digital age, the trigger for a copyright violation of a 
printed document was the act of copying. A photocopy of a document for per
-sonal use falls under the fair-use provisions, but copying now can be done almost 
effortlessly. If a document is made into a PDF ˜le that can be circulated on the 
Internet, the distinction between private use and publication vanishes.

Digital technologies have also made possible new approaches to com
-mercializing the provision of data and data services.
32
 Several legal and policy 
changes of recent years have strengthened the position of copyright holders. 
These include lengthening of the term of copyright protection and the passage 
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). The DMCA imple
-mented the World Intellectual Property Organization treaty on copyrights, 
and criminalized the circumvention of technical measures to prevent copying 
of digital materials, even in the absence of actual copying. These technical 
measures include hardware and software-based access controls, increasingly 
effective forms of encryption, and other forms of digital rights management 
that limit access to or copying of data.
In addition, in 1996 the European Community enacted a Directive on the 
Legal Protection of Databases that established a framework for new propri
-etary rights speci˜c to databases.
33
 Experts have warned that a combination of 
expanded copyright protections, advances in technological means of restrict
-ing access to digital content, and database protections of the type that Europe 
has adopted could enable the assertion and enforcement of proprietary claims 
to factual matter that previously entered the public domain as soon as it was 
disclosed.
34
 The United States and many other countries have not followed 
the European Union in establishing a new intellectual property regime for 
databases. 
An area where advancing technology and the increased use of contracts 
and licensing have changed the environment for access is remote sensing and 
geographic data and services.
35
 Federal agencies have traditionally acquired full 
ownership rights to geographic data (such as maps and books) from private 
entities and have allowed that information to enter the public domain so as to 
be accessible without restrictions to other uses. However, as digital media have 
become more prevalent, private data providers have moved to business models 
focused on selling multiple licenses and access subscriptions to databases. A 
2004 National Research Council report recommended approaches agencies 
should take to licensing geographic data and services in order to maximize their 
utility, including a recommendation that the federal government should foster

the creation of a National Commons and Marketplace in Geographic Informa
-tion.
36
 Such an approach might be relevant to other ˜elds where commercial 
entities play a major role in data collection and dissemination. 
Certainly, copyright protection, licensing, and an active commercial data
-base market can coexist with a strong public domain in digital data. In recent 
years, efforts have been undertaken to utilize licensing to actively foster an 
expanded public domain. Although, as noted above, data are not subject to 
copyright protection, uncertainties about what data users are legally allowed to 
do with them can inhibit sharing and reuse. For example, it may not be clear 
whether a particular data collection is copyrightable or whether the creator 
intends to assert copyright. 
The fact that copyright persists for many yearsŠwhether it is asserted or 
notŠmeans that a database may need to be actively placed into the public 
domain in order for users to be certain that it is free from copyright restric
-tions and any type of reuse is permitted. Creative Commons and its offshoot, 
Science Commons, have developed a number of innovations in the area of 
licensing aimed at facilitating open dissemination, sharing, and use of a wide 
 
variety of information, including data. For example, Creative Commons recently 
launched its CC0 (ﬁCCZeroﬂ) protocol that allows creators of copyrightable 
work, including database generators, to waive all rights they may have to a given 
work, to the extent possible in the applicable jurisdiction.
37
 Patents
Patents give researchers, nonpro˜t organizations, companies, and other 
entities the right to pro˜t from an innovation. In return, the property owner 
must make the innovation public, which enables others to build on it. Once 
intellectual property is patented, it can be freely disseminated while still main
-taining its commercial value to a company or research institution.
The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 has had a major in˚uence on the develop
-ment of products from publicly funded research. The act granted the rights 
to inventions with the university, small-business, or nonpro˜t institution that 
accepted the research grant supporting the work. To accept this ownership, the 
university, small business, or nonpro˜t institution must:

Report each disclosed invention to the funding agency;

Elect to retain title in writing within a statutorily prescribed time frame;

File for patent protection;

Grant the federal government a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevo
-cable, paid-up license to the invention;

Actively promote and attempt to commercialize the invention;

Not assign the rights to the technology, with a few exceptions;

Share royalties with the inventor;

Use any remaining income for education and research;

Give preference to U.S. industry and small business.
For research that is supported exclusively by nonfederal money, the title 
to any inventions resulting from those data is owned according to the condi
-tions established by the funder. For instance, corporate employees must assign 
their intellectual property rights to their employer, even sometimes for work 
done outside the scope of their employment. When research in an academic 
institution is supported by corporate money, the conditions of ownership must 
be clearly speci˜ed. The conditions often include proprietary control over the 
outputs of that research. In the case of academic research that is supported by 
nonpro˜t organizations, control is established by the granting organization. 
One example is the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which retains title to 
all inventions arising from its support but frequently assigns its rights to the 
associated university or nonpro˜t institution. 
Trade secrecy may be used as an alternative to patenting. In some cases, 
inventions and underlying data have been held as proprietary trade secrets by 
companies and even universities and thus are treated as protected information 
as long as reasonable efforts are made to maintain secrecy. Researchers and 
their employers have this option, particularly if they do not plan to seek credit 
for the ˜ndings by reporting or publishing the results. Also, in cases where 
research at a university is supported by a private company, a research contract 
may provide for a short delay in publication or sharing data until the patent
-ability of the research ˜ndings can be evaluated and, if appropriate, patent 
applications are ˜led.
As noted above, academic researchers may have incentives to transfer 
their research ˜ndings to the private sector. These include the desire to see 
their discoveries translated into useful products or to pro˜t themselves from 
commercial opportunities made possible by research. If these incentives cause 
researchers to withhold data, the net effect can be for research data to become 
less available.
In 2006, a National Research Council Committee examined whether 
changes in patenting and licensing practices by companies and research insti
-tutions pose a threat to continued progress in the rapidly advancing areas of 
genomics and proteomics research.
38

efforts, limited access to data is currently not a serious problem. The committee 
recommended that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) continue efforts to 
encourage the free exchange of data and materials through mechanisms such as 
requiring grantees to develop and adhere to data-sharing plans. The committee 
also called for efforts on the part of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Of˜ce to 
improve understanding of rapidly emerging technologies in order to avoid the 
extension of patent protection to inventions that do not meet the patentability 
standards of novelty, utility, and nonobviousness. 
Journals and Access to Data
The interest of scienti˜c, technical, and medical (STM) journals in the 
integrity of research data, and their role in ensuring it, was discussed in Chap
-ter 2. Because journal articles are the primary means of communicating the 
results of research, and rely on data to support their ˜ndings, journals also 
play an important role in facilitating access to data. Although research data 
are not copyrightable, papers incorporating those data are. The conventional 
arrangement in traditional STM publishing has been for authors to transfer 
their copyright in the article they have written to the publisher, generally with 
some retention of rights to use the article.
39
 The environment for STM journal publishing has changed considerably in 
recent years, as it has for nearly all publishing and media businesses.
40
 Tradi
-tional subscription-access STM journals are published by both commercial and 
nonpro˜t entities. Commercial STM publishing has seen signi˜cant consolida
-tion, with fewer companies publishing larger numbers of journals. Subscription 
prices for traditional STM journals have seen steep increases, putting severe 
pressure on research library budgets.
41 Concurrently, open access STM journals 
have emerged as a signi˜cant part of the scholarly publishing world.
42
 One 
prominent example of an open access publisher is Public Library of Science 
(PLoS), which publishes several high-impact journals in the life sciences.
43
 39 
Some universities assert copyright in selected categories of work by faculty, but often grant 
rights back to faculty for the purpose of traditional academic scholarship. See National Academy of 
Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine. 2004.

79Another relevant trend is the growth in open access mandates for pub
-lished research that have been initiated by research sponsors and research 
institutions. The most signi˜cant of these was adopted in early 2008 by NIH, 
having been mandated by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2008 and made permanent in the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009.
44
 The 
NIH policy provides that: 
The Director of the National Institutes of Health (ﬁNIHﬂ) shall require in the current 
˜scal year and thereafter that all investigators funded by the NIH submit or have sub
-mitted for them to the National Library of Medicine™s PubMed Central an electronic 
version of their ˜nal, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication, to be 
made publicly available no later than 12 months after the of˜cial date of publication: 
Provided, that the NIH shall implement the public access policy in a manner consistent 
with copyright law.ﬂ 
45
Research institutions are also adopting open access recommendations for 
faculty research, encouraging faculty to provide electronic copies of their arti
-cles for submission to an institutional or other open access repository, generally 
with an embargo period of 6 to 12 months. This is an international trend, with 
research institutions or sponsors (both public and private) adopting open access 
publication recommendations in Europe, Canada, Australia, and India.
46
 The issues raised by the changing environment for scholarly publishing are 
the subject of continued, vigorous debate. Although they are not within the task 
statement of this study, it is necessary to review them in this context because 
access to scholarly publications is related to access to research data at several 
levels. For example, institutional and governmental repositories that support 
access to, and stewardship of, faculty articles may serve the same function for 
data (the data stewardship function of repositories is discussed in Chapter 4). 
It is also important to note the distinctions between open access to data and 
open access to publications. Traditional access STM publishers that might look 
unfavorably on open access publication mandates might support practices and 
guidelines encouraging open access to data.
47
 Open access mandates for data, 
to be discussed in the next section, are distinct from open access mandates for 
publications.

LEGAL AND POLICY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO DATA
The Data Access Act and the Information Quality Act
Various government laws, regulations, and policies in˚uence the accessibility 
of research data. Among these are the Data Access Act (DAA) of 1999 and the 
Information Quality Act (IQA) of 2001, also known as the Data Quality Act.
48
The DAA is also known as the ﬁShelby Amendment,ﬂ after its sponsor, 
Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. It was passed as a rider to an appro
-priations bill in 1999. The DAA requires that data from federally funded 
research be made available to requesting parties under Freedom of Informa
-tion Act procedures if the research is: (1) used to support an agency action, 
and (2) performed by a university or other nonpro˜t institution.
49
 In response, 
OMB modi˜ed its Circular A-110 to read as follows:
 [I]n response to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request for research data 
relating to published research ˜ndings under an award that were used by the federal 
government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law, the 
federal awarding agency shall request, and the recipient will provide within a reason

The provision established which types of research data are subject to dis
-closure and the procedures, standards, and exemptions that apply in requesting 
and disclosing those data. Before the provision was published, persons could 
only obtain raw data that were in possession of a federal agency, whereas the 
revised provision provided access to data that are in possession of a grantee 
institution. If even a small amount of public money was used to produce data, 
those data may be subject to DAA requests. However, studies conducted by 
industry or by others without the use of public funds are not covered by the 
data-sharing requirements, even if the studies are employed in the formulation 
of public policy or regulations. Also, as interpreted by OMB, the provision 
applies only to data supporting regulations with a ﬁmajorﬂ impact on the 
economy and is prospective, covering studies launched after the OMB guide
-lines were put into effect.
The DAA was controversial at the time the legislation passed and when 
OMB was developing the speci˜c changes to Circular A-110. Participants in a 
2001 National Research Council workshop pointed out future problems that

might not be an ideal way to ensure public access to data underlying federal 
policies and regulations.
50
 At the same time, the DAA does not appear to have 
led to any contentious cases during the decade since it went into effect. For 
example, a 2003 General Accounting Of˜ce report found that two agencies had 
received a total of 42 requests under the DAA up to that time, and that none 
of the requests had actually met the Circular A-110 criteria.
51
The IQA was passed as a two-sentence rider to the 2001 Consolidated 
Appropriations Act. The IQA called on OMB to issue regulations for ﬁensur
-ing and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of informa
-tion (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.ﬂ In 
response, OMB issued guidelines that all agencies ﬁmust embrace a basic stan
-dard of quality as a performance goal, and agencies must incorporate quality 
into their information dissemination practices.ﬂ
52
 The guidelines state that ﬁif an agency is responsible for disseminating 
in˚uential scienti˜c, ˜nancial, or statistical information, agency guidelines shall 
include a high degree of transparency about data and methods to facilitate the 
reproducibility of such information by quali˜ed third parties.ﬂ
53
 For ﬁoriginal 
and supporting data,ﬂ agencies are to consult with ﬁrelevant scienti˜c and tech
-nical communitiesﬂ and determine which data are subject to the reproducibility 
requirement.54 ﬁReproducibilityﬂ here means a high level of transparency about 
research design and methods, which is meant to negate any need to replicate 
work before dissemination. For ﬁanalytic resultsﬂ there must be ﬁsuf˜cient 
transparency about data and methods that an independent reanalysis could be 
undertaken.ﬂ

Federal and Journal Policies Affecting the Availability of Data
Table 2-2 shows federal agency policies toward availability of data gener
-ated directly by agencies as well as data generated by external grantees. In 
2008 the federal government released its Principles for the Release of Scienti˜c 
Research Results in response to the America COMPETES Act of 2007.
59
 These 
principles promote sharing of data from research undertaken by federal civilian 
agency employees. 
For federally sponsored research performed by external organizations, 
the grants guides of agencies vary in how strongly data sharing is encouraged 
or required. A 2007 Government Accountability Of˜ce (GAO) assessment of 
agency policies toward grantees in climate science found that although agen
-cies encouraged data sharing, the speci˜c requirements varied from program 
to program.
60
 For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) grants 
guide states the expectation that grantees make their data ﬁwidely available 
and usefulﬂ within a ﬁreasonable time.ﬂ Speci˜c NSF programs might require 
that data be deposited in a speci˜c repository within a set time period follow
-ing data collection. The GAO report also found that agencies generally do 
not monitor whether data-sharing requirements are being met and have not 
overcome
 barriers to sharing, such as the lack of appropriate data archives in 
some sub˜elds of climate science.
Although speci˜c federally sponsored research programs include a range 
of data-sharing mandates, no federal agency has yet adopted an agencywide 
open access data mandate, analogous to NIH™s open access publication man
-date. NIH does require that grant proposals above a certain size include a 
data management plan consistent with NIH™s Data Sharing Policy, which is 
discussed further below in the section on ﬁResponsibilities of Research Institu

THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF 
 ACCESS TO RESEARCH DATA
The advent of digital networks has enabled and stimulated global access 
to all types of digital information, including research data. Access to research 
data online means that researchers can use the data on a global basis, enhancing 
the universal progress of science to solve common problems and develop new 
knowledge. Both the bene˜ts and the costs of unrestricted and restricted access 
are thus ampli˜ed in the international context.
The United States has been a leader in promoting openness to public 
 
sector information, as well as to publicly funded research data. Despite the 
trends in ˜elds with commercial potential toward more proprietary treatment 
of academic research and the post-September 11 increase in national security 
restrictions on some sensitive data sources and types, the overall policy trend 
may be seen as moving toward greater access to both governmental and aca
-demic research data sources. The international dimensions of access to research 
data are being shaped both from the bottom up and the top down.
At the informal working level of the individual investigator, data are now 
shared across geographic boundaries as easily as they once were with the col
-league next door. Countless international data exchanges are made among 
scientists on a daily basis, or through the posting of datasets on individual 
researchers™ Web sites.
At a more formal level, international research projects establish data
-sharing 
protocols that re˚ect the norms of the ˜elds in which they are operating. Some 
of the larger research or infrastructure programs are establishing data centers 
or federated networks for sharing of data resources. The ˜rst international net
-work of such data centers, the World Data Center system, was formed following 
the 1957 International Geophysical Year to help bridge the gap in cooperation 
and data exchanges during the cold war.

 THE
 INTEGRITY,
 ACCESSIBILITY,
 AND
 STEWARDSHIP
 OF
 DATA
With the advent of global digital networks over the past two decades, both 
international cooperation in research and the formation of networked data 
resources on regional and global levels have become commonplace. Examples 
include the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the International Federa
-tion of Digital Seismograph Networks, the International Nucleotide Sequence 
Database Collaboration, the International Virtual Observatory Alliance, and 
the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, to name but a few. Almost all 
˜elds of inquiry have some data centers or networks designed to provide access 
to data. In most cases, the U.S. research community has been the organizing 
force for the collaborative data-sharing networks.
Greater access to research data from public funding also is receiving more 
attention at the national policy levels of many countries, in part because such 
data resources are now seen as being major research infrastructure components. 
For example, the Research Councils of the United Kingdom adopted a more 
open policy for their data holdings in 2006. The Ministry of Science and Tech
-nology in China initiated the Scienti˜c Data Sharing Project in 2002, in recog
-nition of the fact that ﬁ[t]he insuf˜cient use of China™s massive data holdings 
has been an urgent problem.ﬂ
64
 Many other countries are similarly reviewing 
or revising their national policies and myriad institutional ones to make better 
use of their data resources.
Finally, some international scienti˜c, engineering, and medical organiza
-tions at both the intergovernmental and nongovernmental levels, such as the 
International Council of Scienti˜c Unions, the Committee on Data for Science 
and Technology, and the OECD, are developing data-sharing policies and 
guidelines for adoption by members and the international research commu
-nity. For example, the OECD in 2007 published its Principles and Guidelines 
for Access to Research Data from Public Funding, which are summarized in 
Box 3-2. The InterAcademy Panel, an organization of national science acad
-emies, supports a program to expand access to digital scienti˜c information to 
researchers in developing countries.

GENERAL PRINCIPLE FOR ENHANCING 
 ACCESS TO RESEARCH DATA

-ated, it is possible to say both that more data are being publicly disseminated 
than have ever been before and that more data are being withheld from public

 RESEARCH
 DATA 
85access today than have ever been before. Many ˜elds of research have moved 
toward more open data-sharing policies as the value of data has increased 
and as digital technologies have enabled information to be disseminated more 
broadly. At the same time, heightened interest in the commercial applications 
of research data has caused some forms of data to be more restricted.
As described earlier in this chapter, there are legitimate reasons why some 
research data are not made publicly available, ranging from privacy concerns to 
technical barriers. Yet the basic principle that should guide decisions involving 
research data supporting publicly reported research results is clear:
Data Access and Sharing Principle: Research data, methods, and other infor
-mation integral to publicly reported results should be publicly accessible.
This principle applies throughout research, but in some cases the open dis
-semination of research data may not be possible or advisable when viewed from 
the perspective of enhancing research in science, engineering, or medicine. 
Access to research data prior to reporting results based on those data might 
undermine the incentives to pursue the research. There might also be technical 
barriers, such as the sheer size of datasets, that make sharing problematic, or 
legal restrictions on sharing as discussed in the section on ﬁLegal and Policy 
Requirements for Access to Data.ﬂ Also, ﬁaccessibleﬂ does not necessarily 
imply that data should be disseminated for free, though free or marginally 
priced distribution is the ideal. Nor are researchers responsible for providing 
data users with instruction or training in the use of their data, though they do 
have a responsibility to provide metadata, analysis software, models (including 
code and input data) and other information necessary for practitioners to vali
-date and build on the results. Where researchers have proprietary interests in 
such tools, they have the option of protecting those interests through applying 
for patents and/or asserting copyright, as appropriate, in advance of publicly 
reporting results.
This principle is a standard that is not currently being met in some areas of 
research. Yet it provides a yardstick against which to measure current initiatives 
and future plans. Researchers know that the information they generate should 
be available to others to advance the frontiers of knowledge. The objective 
therefore must be to implement policies and promote practices that allow this 
principle to be realized as fully as possible. 
This principle may seem to apply only to publicly funded research, but 
a strong case can be made that much data from privately funded research 
should be made publicly available as well. In many cases, making such data 
available can produce societal bene˜ts while not threatening the commercial 
opportunities that led to the data™s generation. Note that this principle covers 
data underlying publicly reported results. When a researcher working at a cor
-porate lab seeks to publish results, patent applications can be ˜led in advance

of publication, so that making data accessible at the time of publication will 
not compromise commercialization of the invention in question. If a company 
decides to protect an invention as a trade secret, it might be assumed that 
researchers will not publish papers about the invention and the question of 
providing access to data will not arise. 
In the past few years we have also seen private companies announce plans 
to make signi˜cant data resources available on an open access basis. For exam
-ple, Merck has spun off a nonpro˜t, open access platform known as Sage.
66
 Sage is aimed at helping researchers to build new databases aimed at more 
effectively modeling disease. Where possible, public policies should encourage 
the release of such data, and privately funded researchers and their managers 
should explore possible means of making data available.
The Access and Sharing Principle is consistent with recommendations from 
National Academies committees that have previously addressed data access. A 
2003 report, 
Sharing

 and

 in

 puts forward the ﬁuniform principle for sharing 
integral data and materials expeditiously (UPSIDE).ﬂ
67
 The UPSIDE principle 
calls on researchers employed in the academic, government, and commercial 
sectors to provide data and materials needed to support published ˜ndings, 
and to ﬁprovide them in a form on which other scientists can build with further 
research.ﬂ The 1997 report

 states that ﬁfull and open access to scienti˜c data should be adopted as 
the international norm for the exchange of scienti˜c data derived from publicly

68
RESPONSIBILITIES OF RESEARCHERS
As with the integrity of research data, the primary responsibility for shar
-ing data lies with the researchers who produced them. (In addition, other parts 
of the research enterprise have responsibilities for sharing data, as described 
later in this chapter and in the next chapter.) Only researchers know their data 
well enough to ascertain what information must be publicly available to allow 
others to verify their results and build on their work. Only researchers are in a 
position to work with research institutions, research sponsors, and journals to 
make data available in a way that they can be understood and used effectively 
by others. Thus, our committee recommends that:

Making data available does not necessarily mean providing them at no cost. 
The next chapter discusses the need for research projects to develop plans for 
the management and sharing of data from the initial stages of a research pro
-gram. Chapter 4 also describes the evolving infrastructure for providing data 
access and stewardship, whose components include institutional and disciplin
-ary repositories. 
Ful˜lling this recommendation also requires that researchers be familiar 
with any possible constraints on the release of data. Although this information 
is usually known to researchers and their managers from the outset of a research 
project, agreements may be informal, may be understood differently by different 
parties (such as principal investigators and graduate students), or may change 
during the course of a research project. Requiring that researchers clarify and 
agree to these arrangements places the responsibility on researchers to oversee 
the accessibility of research data and to decide whether to participate in research 
where data accessibility is limited. Researchers who are considering becoming 
involved in a project where data accessibility is restricted need to ask themselves 
whether the bene˜ts of participating in that project outweigh the bene˜ts of 
transparency in generating and disseminating data.
Research thrives under conditions where data are available to others. If data 
are not available, there should be a clear and public reason why those data are 
being withheld from dissemination. Indeed, justi˜cations for not making data 
available should be understood by the researcher, sponsor, and institution. Dis
-semination of the reasons why data are being withheld could be published with 
journal articles, posted on Web sites, stated in the publicly accessible award state
-ments of research sponsors or research institutions, or made available by some 
other means. The important point is that the reasons should be publicly available 
so that others can review and comment on the grounds for withholding data. 
As discussed in the following section, the committee believes that research 
˜elds, research sponsors, research institutions, and journals have considerable 
ability to set appropriate standards and expectations regarding data access and 
sharing, and to develop the necessary incentives. Some are taking leadership 
roles in setting standards and instituting incentives. The committee believes 
that continued efforts taken by these stakeholders can create an environment in 
which the Data Access and Sharing Principle is widely followed in the research 
enterprise, and in which a bureaucratic framework of regulations and enforce
-ment will not need to be imposed.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF RESEARCH FIELDS
As emphasized earlier, there are major differences between research ˜elds 
in the handling of data, including technological infrastructure, publication 
practices, and data-sharing expectations. In some ˜elds, aspects of their data 
culture act as barriers to access and sharing of data. Because of the growing 
importance of research data and the rate at which practices are changing in 
research, it is important for various ˜elds and disciplines to examine their 
standards and practices regarding data and to make these explicit.
The development of plans for data management and sharing is greatly 
facilitated when a ˜eld of research has standards and institutions in place 
designed to promote the accessibility of data.

The development of standards and institutions can occur in different ways 
depending partly on the ˜eld of research in which it occurs. The process can 
be led by journal editors, professional societies, ad hoc bodies of researchers 
established to solve particular problems, or permanent institutions charged 
with overseeing data management issues. National Academies committees 
and advisory committees to federal agencies can play constructive roles. In 
large, complex ˜elds, multiple initiatives may be undertaken to address various 
aspects of standard setting. Input and participation from international stake
-holders will often be needed.
The life sciences provide useful examples of the standards-setting process. 
As described in Box 3-4, a National Academies committee developed broad 
standards for the sharing of research data in the life sciences. Similarly, as 
described in Box 3-5, a journal-led effort incorporating community input devel
-oped the Paris Guidelines for the management of protein data. Both examples 
demonstrate how standards can be put in place to deal with existing or new 
issues affecting the management of research data.
The Principles for the Release of Scienti˜c Research Results, released in 
2008 and discussed in the earlier section on ﬁFederal and Journal Policies 
Affecting the Availability of Data,ﬂ establish data-sharing standards for research 
conducted by employees of federal civilian agencies.

 The Paris Guidelines
 In some ˚elds, journals have played a major role in developing standards for 
data collection, sharing, and preservation. In 2004, for example, the journal 
Molecular 
and Cellular Proteomics
 (MCP) developed standards for the management of protein 
data.
a These standards were revised 1 year later based on community input, resulting 
in the ﬁParis Guidelines.ﬂ
b These guidelines were made available in a checklist format, 
in a tutorial, and in MCP-hosted workshops to educate researchers about the details 
of the requirements for publication and data submission.
c MCP™s standard requires all relevant quantitative data to be made available 
at a level in which it is possible to reproduce the reported results. Methods can 
reference previously published standards but any deviations must be explained. In 
 
particular, authors must submit along with the manuscript the data that have the 
greatest potential for misinterpretationŠfor instance, mass spectrographic spectra for 
post-translationally modi˚ed proteinsŠfor the journal to publish.
 Data considered less important but worthy of access are recommended for 
submission to the journal as supplementary material to be deposited in a nonjournal 
repository, which therefore may not be archival.
d In addition, an institutionally based 
government-funded data depository was recommended (ﬁTrancheﬂ) that has a dis
-tributed storage system similar to Bit Torrent, thereby lessening costly bandwidth 
problems caused by downloading large amounts of data over the Internet.
 In this way the Paris guidelines ensure that the most important data are depos
-ited for perpetual and accessible storage while second-tier data also are accessible 
without placing too large a burden on the journal as the sole repository for data.

Research data produced by scientists working within Federal agencies should, to the 
maximum extent possible and consistent with existing Federal law, regulations, and 
Presidential directives and orders, be made publicly available consistent with established 
practices in the relevant ˜elds of research.
This principle is consistent with the Data Sharing and Access Principle 
stated above. This report advocates that the principle apply not just to federal 
scientists but to all research where results are publicly reported.

A wide range of issues must be considered in setting data standards, includ

vary greatly from ˜eld to ˜eld, depending on particular traditions and require

which all researchers should adhereŠindeed, the general principles stated in 
this report apply to all researchersŠevery ˜eld collectively and every researcher 
individually must address issues of data accessibility.

-tions and research sponsors need to create incentives for researchers to share 
data, just as they have incentives to maintain the integrity of research data and 
to publish their ˜ndings. Researchers need both formal and informal ways of 
being acknowledged and rewarded for making research data accessible and 
usable. For example, in some cases tenure and promotion decisions could 
take into account efforts to promote the accessibility of data, the creation of 
 
publication-based metrics, or service to a community or institution. 
Data professionals also have an important role to play in ensuring the 
accessibility of research data. In close cooperation with researchers in a ˜eld, 
data professionals can anticipate the needs of data users and establish data 
management systems that meet those needs. Their contributions to making data 
accessible, as well as ensuring the integrity of data, need to be recognized.
One way for research sponsors and journals to promote data accessibility is 
to establish the terms of access and sharing expected of institutions and inves
-tigators. For example, NIH explicitly requires that all grant applications for 
more than 
$500,000 in direct costs in a single year must include a data manage
-ment plan that embodies the principles of the NIH Data Sharing Policy. This 
policy says that ﬁdata should be made as widely and freely available as possible 
while safeguarding the privacy of participants, and protecting con˜dential and

and ﬁNIH expects that plan to be enacted. . . . In the case of noncompliance 
(depending on its severity and duration) NIH can take various actions to pro
-tect the Federal Government™s interests.ﬂ
70
 These actions are not speci˜ed but 
may affect the review of future proposals.
As discussed above, research institutions, research sponsors, and journals 
have considerable leverage in encouraging data access and sharing on the part 
of researchers. Several leading research institutions have announced open access 
publication recommendations, which encourage faculty to deposit their publica
-tions in their institutional repository. Such recommendations could be extended 
to data. Some federal research programs and journals have adopted open access 
data policies that require or encourage researchers to deposit underlying data in 
a disciplinary or institutional repository (see Tables 2-1 and 2-2). Depending on 
the program or discipline, adopting and effectively enforcing such open access 
data policies may be an appropriate way for research institutions, research spon
-sors, and journals to implement this recommendation. 
The Council on Government Relations points out that ﬁfew institutions 
have formal policies and procedures for access to and retention of research 
data.ﬂ
71
 As described above, the terms of research contracts and grants and 
other regulations often specify that research institutions are responsible for 
retaining data and providing access. Given the current lack of formal policies 
and procedures, we make the following recommendation.

to keep it. Or researchers and institutions may have different perspectives on 
how to respond to outside requests for access to data, including requests made 
under the auspices of the DAA or in connection with litigation. As described 
earlier in this chapter, requests for information can go beyond research data to 
information about a researcher™s personal life.
Procedures for handling requests for data that either intentionally or inad
-vertently hamper the progress of research need special attention. Although the 
data from publicly funded research should be accessible in general, exploiting 
the norms of science to slow or stop the progress of research harms society. For 
example, institutional policies might stipulate that an institution will come to 
the aid of researchers in disputes with third parties, but researchers also must 
comply with institutional policies.
Many journals play a critical role in ensuring access to the data that sup
-port the publications appearing in those journals (see Box 3-6 for an example). 
Access to those data may be lost as journals evolve under the pressures of dra
-matic changes being catalyzed by digital technologies. The following chapter 
covers the responsibilities of journals to make data accessible in the context of 
the long-term preservation of research data.

 Promoting Reproducibility in Medical Research
 As of April 1, 2007, the 
Annals of Internal Medicine
 instituted a new policy 
designed to help the research community evaluate and build on published results. 
Authors of original research articles in the 
Annals are required to include a state
-ment indicating whether the study protocol, data, and statistical code are available 
to readers and under what terms the authors will share this information. Sharing is 
not mandatory, but authors are required to state whether they are willing to share the 
protocol, data, and statistical code. Authors are not asked whether they are willing to 
make this information available until after a manuscript is accepted for publication.
 According to an article announcing the new policy, the goal of the new require
-ment is to promote ﬁreproducible researchﬂ in which independent researchers can 
reproduce results using the same procedures and data as the original investigators. 
Reproducible research does not require unlimited access to data and methods, but it 
requires access to as much of the dataset and statistical procedures as is necessary 
to reproduce the published results. As the article states:
Major cultural shifts in research must occur before a world of completely 
reproducible research can exist. These shifts include increasing the technical 
 
capacity of many research teams, further developing acceptable data-sharing 
mechanisms, and supportingŠboth professionally and ˚nanciallyŠthe pub
-lishing of reproducible research. . . . We hope that shining a spotlight on the 
availability of the study protocol, data, and statistical code for every 
Annals research report will be seen as a small but important step toward biomedical 
research that the public can really trust. At the same time, it will enhance what 
is perhaps the main function of a journal: to provide a transparent medium for 
a conversation about science.

All rights reserved.4Promoting the Stewardship of 
 Research Data
Realizing the full value of research data requires that the data be accessible 
to the community of researchers and others who might be able to use them. 
The data need to be accompanied by suf˜cient metadata for them to be found 
easily, understood in context, and used appropriately. Data need to be stored 
in repositories using up-to-date technologies until a decision is made that the 
information is no longer needed. Data useful for ongoing research or historical 
purposes may need to be stored inde˜nitely. These issues of useful
 accessibility, 
annotation, curation, and preservation are the heart of what we term in this 
report the 
stewardship
 of research data.
Digital technologies are having a revolutionary effect on every aspect of data 
stewardship. The Internet provides a mechanism for making data available to any
-one anywhere in the world. Powerful new computers and sophisticated software 
can automate part of the process of annotating data. Data repositories offer a 
means for preserving digital data for the inde˜nite future. Though the infrastruc
-ture necessary for data stewardship is still taking shape, much of the technological 
capability needed to realize the full value of research data already exists.
Secondary use of data is of growing importance in an increasing number 
of ˜elds. In astronomy, for example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a project for 
which the open provision of both processed and raw data over the Internet is 
central, is the facility responsible for the most high-impact papers in astronomy 
in recent years.

(see Figure 4-1). In other areas, such as clinical data, the potential gains from 
data reuse are clear, even though technical and other barriers stand in the way 
of realizing that potential.
2This technological capability has given rise to a powerful new vision of 
how some areas of research can be conducted.
3 Known as e-science or cyber
-infrastructure, this approach to research involves decentralized collaborations 
of researchers who draw on remote sensors and facilities, very large data col
-lections, and powerful computing resources. These distributed resources are 
interconnected so that they can be shared in a ˚exible, secure, and coordinated 
manner. Individuals and groups can build and make available services and 
tools that extend across research ˜elds.
4 In an interconnected grid of facilities, 
instruments, and computers, the collective knowledge of scienti˜c, engineer
-ing, and medical research resides not just in published books and articles but 
in the grid itself.
THE LOSS AND UNDERUTILIZATION OF RESEARCH DATA
E-science has been partially implemented in a number of research ˜elds, 
but in others information technology is not being used to advantage.
Today, much research data that could be of value in the future are lost 
because of the lack of provisions for preserving them: Research notebooks are 
discarded; computer hard disks crash, destroying unique data; an investigator 
changes ˜elds, retires, or dies and leaves behind data that are poorly organized, 
haphazardly stored, or otherwise unusable.
Digital data are often stored in formats that rapidly become technologically 
obsolete. Data stored on paper can survive for decades or centuries before the 
paper breaks down and becomes unreadable. In the digital age, however, the 
longevity of storage media sometimes seems to conform to an inverse Moore™s 
law, with accelerating technological advances hastening the demise of super
-seded media. Many scientists have data on ˚oppy disks, hard drives, or zip 
drives that new generations of computers cannot read. One expert raises the 
possibility of a ﬁdigital dark age,ﬂ in which large amounts of digital data stored 
in a variety of proprietary ˜le formats are permanently lost.
5 Digital media also decay over time, a phenomenon known as ﬁbit rot.ﬂ 
Many old magnetic tapes molder in boxes and are now essentially worthless.

research community, resources can be devoted to replication so as to minimize 
the risk of digital media decay. As generations of applications, data formats, 
operating systems, and digital archives interoperate and succeed one another, 
multiple locations and systems for data access and sharing might be engaged 
to preserve a given data collection. Ensuring that archived data are not altered 
due to human error or intentional mischief is an additional challenge for large 
data repositories, particularly those utilizing automated processes to ingest large 
datasets.

 OF
 DATA
The loss of valuable data is especially a problem in small research projects. 
Large projects often have data management plans and funds set aside for data 
storage and dissemination. Individual investigators, however, typically face 
much greater challenges in deciding which data may be useful in the future, 
in documenting those data thoroughly, and in ˜nding funds from limited bud
-gets for adequate data curation and preservation. Furthermore, although large 
projects can generate immense quantities of data, small research projects can 
themselves produce substantial quantities and varied kinds of data.
Some research ˜elds that formerly consisted almost exclusively of small 
projects, such as molecular biology or ecology, have moved in part toward 
larger and more data-intensive programs. Some of these ˜elds have groups that 
oversee the collection and annotation of data for use by others. The social sci
-ences, for example, have long sponsored a specialized institution that has data 
stewardship as part of its mission (see Box 4-1). Other ˜elds, despite generating 
much larger quantities of data, continue to be characterized by largely disparate 
and often inadequate data management efforts.
Not all research data should be preserved, but deciding what to save and 
what to discard becomes increasingly dif˜cult as ever larger quantities of data 
are generated. Furthermore, there is a ˜nancial trade-off between creating 
new data and preserving old data. While the cost of storage per bit is declin
-ing rapidly, as described in Chapter 1, data stewardship requires a long-term 
commitment of attention and resources. As the secondary use of data becomes 
more important for ˜elds and disciplines, they need to develop guidance for 
researchers, research sponsors, and research institutions on what data should be 
preserved, and whether new organizations or capabilities are needed to perform 
stewardship functions. A 2002 National Research Council report on geosciences 
data and collections is a useful example of how research ˜elds can develop cri
-teria for prioritizing the data and collections that should be preserved, and for 
making the trade-offs between creating new data and preserving existing data.

The discussion of neuroscience data issues in Box 1-3 illustrates the challenges 
facing data-intensive ˜elds that need to develop policies, standards, and new 
organizational approaches to data stewardship. 
Ownership considerations in˚uence the stewardship of research data, just 
as they do access to the data. As discussed in Chapter 3, the institutions that 
receive research grants are generally acknowledged to be the owners of the 
data and other ﬁintangible propertyﬂ resulting from that research.
8 However, 
for practical reasons, researchers may retain possession of the data on behalf of 
the institution, and institutions may specify in policies or contracts that inves
-tigators are to serve as the custodian of data and as the responsible party for 
preserving and retaining data.
9 Indeed, investigators often assume that they are 
the owners of the research data that they produce, which can create problems 
when they move to a different institution and their original institution exerts 
its ownership rights over the data.
INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCENTI
VES FOR THE 
 STEWARDSHIP OF DATA
Each group associated with the generation, use, and preservation of 
research data has different incentives and expertise with respect to the steward
-ship of those data.
Researchers
Although the researchers who generate the data have the greatest stake in 
their use, they do not necessarily have a strong interest or incentive in preserv
-ing data, especially in small-scale projects. Most researchers prefer to pursue 
new goals rather than devote effort to making their existing and past data use
-ful for others. Figure 4-2 shows the results of a survey by the Inter-University 
Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). Many National Science 
Foundation (NSF)- and NIH-sponsored projects that promised to create social 
science data have not followed through. Investigators typically have little exper
-tise in data annotation or long-term database management. 
This resistance to sharing on the part of faculty is changing over time, 
and this can be expected to accelerate as the value of publicly accessible data 
becomes more apparent in a wider range of disciplines, and as infrastructure for

 Data Stewardship and Accessibility in the 
 Social Sciences
 The Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) is 
an interdisciplinary institution established in 1962 to provide data stewardship and 
access for a wide range of datasets from the social sciences. Part of a global network 
of social science data archives, ICPSR is the world™s largest archive of digital social 
science data and is hosted by the University of Michigan.
a It is supported by dues 
from more than 600 member institutions, plus support from government agencies and 
other research sponsors.
 ICPSR, which currently houses 7,500 studies and 500,000 data ˚les, has rec
-ommended guidelines, but not requirements, for submission of data. As part of its 
mission, ICPSR proactively seeks out data at risk of being lost. It also emphasizes 
the importance of preparing good documentation, or metadata, which are critical to 
data interpretation and to successful data sharing and preservation. These meta
-data include project summaries, descriptions of data collection instruments, summary 
 
statistics, database dictionaries, and bibliographies. As technology progresses, ICPSR 
migrates data to new storage media and maintains sets of redundant copies in various 
locations. 
 Ownership and access to data in the social sciences is determined by funding, 
with contract-funded data belonging to the sponsor and grant-funded data belonging 
to the grantee (typically a university). ICPSR does not acquire copyright to databases 
but instead requests permission to redistribute. Barriers to data access and sharing 
in the social sciences include generally weak federal requirements to archive and 
provide access to research data and the heterogeneity of expectations across ˚elds 
(with economics, demography, sociology, and criminology having a stronger tradition 
of data sharing than anthropology and epidemiology).
 In a recent ICPSR study on data-sharing and archiving practices,
 researchers surveyed principal investigators from NIH- and NSF-funded projects and asked whether 
their projects had produced data and, if so, whether the data had been archived (see 
Figure 4-2). Of the 1,599 responses received as of late 2008, 327
 studies had been 
archived, 876 studies were still in the hands of researchers, and 396 studies had 
been ﬁlost.ﬂ
 Preserving and sharing social sciences data involves the risk of violating an 
individual™s privacy. Each data collection is reviewed to see if it could reveal individual 
identities. If such information is found, it is removed, masked, or collapsed in the 
public-use version. ICPSR staff are trained and certi˚ed in disclosure risk limitation 
procedures. Original restricted data can be requested under terms of a contract, and 
the most sensitive data can be viewed onsite in a nonnetworked ﬁdata enclaveﬂ with 
signi˚cant security checks.
 ICPSR also has a strong educational component. Workshops and courses on 
research methods in the quantitative social sciences are offered to graduate students 
and faculty from around the world, mainly in the summer. ICPSR also provides data-
driven instructional modules at the undergraduate level to enable teachers to integrate 
data into the curriculum.
 Over time, ICPSR™s archival model has proven to be an effective approach to 
ensuring data integrity, facilitating data sharing, and providing data stewardship across 
a range of ˚elds and many institutions. Because many social science data are used for 
secondary analysis, and because the social sciences reward academic pr
oducers of 
general-purpose data, universities see the value of ICPSR, which makes the member
-ship funding model sustainable.
 The emerging world of massively complex and voluminous data raises new 
challenges. There will be no single repository and no single harmonization scheme. 
Unrestricted access is needed to realize the full value of data, which may lead to 
greater risk of disclosure and con˚dentiality breaches. New tools need to be devel
-oped to enable the merging of disparate data and communication across disciplines. 
Building new, dynamic communities around data and cutting-edge research questions 
will require the collaborative efforts of technologists and domain scientists. A greater

 Research institutions typically have more experience with the long-term 
preservation of data than do individual researchers, especially since many insti

103can then be accessed by anyone over the Internet. Many repository efforts are 
led by university libraries, which have begun exploring the new issues posed by 
research data and other digital information as increasingly central components 
of the scholarly record.
13
 These efforts are part of a trend in which some research institutions, large 
research universities in particular, are reassessing their institutional role in the 
dissemination and stewardship of scholarship, both that of their own faculty 
and more broadly.
14
 During the time when the scholarly record was primarily 
print-based, a relatively small number of research libraries, most connected 
with research institutions, saw comprehensive stewardship of scholarship as 
part of their missions. Likewise, in the digital age, some research institutions 
and their libraries are likely to play leadership roles in the stewardship of 
research data.
Institutional repositories naturally face challengesŠfor instance, build
-ing faculty awareness and participationŠeven at large institutions.
15
 A recent 
report on the role of research libraries in providing repository services identi
-˜es several key issues as repositories develop and grow.
16
 The issues include 
building new services (as the focus expands from publications, theses, and dis
-sertations to research data, courseware, images, and other content), engaging 
with the larger networked environment (as the demand grows for higher-level, 
cross-repository services), attending to the ﬁdemand sideﬂ (meeting the needs 
of heterogeneous user groups), and sustainability (going beyond money to 
organizational commitment). 
Smaller institutions that seek to ful˜ll a stewardship mission face even 
greater challenges. The size and complexity of digital datasets can overwhelm 
small institutional libraries or archives, which traditionally have dealt with 
 
analog textual information. Yet new partnerships and approaches hold the 
promise of overcoming many of these barriers. For example, the National Insti
-tute for Technology and Liberal Education now offers institutional repository 
services to member institutions for an annual fee.

Federal Agencies, Data Centers, and Digital Archives
Federal agencies and other funding organizations can play key roles in 
preserving research data. In some ˜elds, such as the earth and environmental 
sciences, federal agencies play a central role in the collection and stewardship 
of research data. For example, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) collects, manages, and disseminates a wide range of 
climate, weather, ecosystem and other environmental data used by scientists, 
engineers, resource managers, policy makers, and others in the United States 
and around the world. NOAA must deal with the challenges of an increasing 
volume and diversity of its data holdingsŠwhich include everything from 
satellite images of clouds to the stomach contents of ˜shŠas well as a large 
number of users. 
A recent National Research Council report offered nine general principles 
for effective environmental data management, along with a number of guide
-lines on how the principles could be applied at NOAA.
18
 The principles and 
guidelines developed for NOAA are consistent with the principles laid out 
in this study, and represent an example of how they apply to an agency with 
signi˜cant data management responsibilities in the earth sciences. The descrip
-tion of NOAA™s data management challenges also illustrates the challenges of 
providing access and stewardship for large, heterogeneous datasets.
In some ˜elds, federal agencies have established large digital archives that 
house important collections of data provided by grantees and other external 
researchers. NCBI at the National Library of Medicine is perhaps the best exam
-ple. NCBI houses several data and literature collections, provides education, and 
develops software for various computational biology applications. GenBank, 
which has been discussed previously, is a large database of nucleotide sequences 
that has become an essential national and global resource in the life sciences.
19
Federal agencies have traditionally supported the data management needs 
of the research ˜elds with which they work most closely. NSF is undertaking a 
large initiative explicitly focused on developing capabilities to meet longer-term 
data stewardship needs across science and engineering ˜elds.
20
 The Sustainable 
Digital Data Preservation and Access Network (DataNet) program intends to 
make about ˜ve awards totaling 
$100 million over 5 years to organizations that 
will ﬁprovide reliable digital preservation, access, integration, and analysis capa
-bilities for science and/or engineering data over a decades-long timeline.ﬂ By

105the awardees would be helping to demonstrate the feasibility of long-term 
digital stewardship. 
In other ˜elds where federal agencies themselves are not as central to data 
collection and stewardship efforts, federal capabilities may be more limited. In 
these cases, nonfederal research sponsors need the support and active partici
-pation of research institutions and communities if they are to help ensure the 
long-term preservation and availability of data. Also, sponsors may be more 
interested in the initial development of data collections than in maintaining 
those collections over long periods as an open-ended commitment.
The federal government can also foster data exchange among research 
institutions and companies in speci˜c, highly applied areas. For example, the 
Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) is a joint activity of 
the military services, other federal agencies such as the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration and the Department of Energy, defense and space 
contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon, and even the 
Canadian Department of National Defence.
21
 GIDEP has existed since the 
1950s, and is a mechanism for sharing research, development, design, testing, 
acquisition, and logistics information among government and industry partici
-pants in order to reduce or eliminate expenditures.
In recent years, other organizations and networks, including data centers, 
have taken on important roles in the stewardship of research data. The San 
Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), managed by the University of
 California 
at San Diego, is a high-performance computing center and a national data host
-ing facility, providing an integrated set of data services (access, manipulation, 
management, and storage).
22
 SDSC is a data services provider for the Protein 
Data Bank and the National Virtual Observatory (NVO). For NVO, SDSC 
stores two replicants of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as well as other sky sur
-veys, over 88 terabytes in all. SDSC DataCentral also hosts over 100
 community data collections, including Molecular Dynamics Simulation Data (chemistry), 
Human Brain Dynamics Resource data (neuroscience), and Employment 
Responses to Global Markets data (economics). 
SDSC™s agreements with research communities vary substantially with 
regard to standards, sharing, formats and ontologies, usage scenarios, and 
intellectual property. SDSC utilizes multiple levels of data reliability and data 
integrity mechanisms.
Research communities and data centers such as SDSC need to develop 
common understanding on key issues such as trust, expectations, incentives
/penalties, and privacy/security/con˜dentiality. Good long-term stewardship 
requires resources for increased capacity, up-to-date reliability tools, and skilled 
people. Developing sustainable economic models for long-term stewardship is

a challenge. In some very high-priority areas, federal support on an ﬁin˜nite 
mortgageﬂ basis might be sustainable. In other cases, some combination of 
relay funding, user fees, endowments, and other mechanisms may need to be 
employed.
Companies and Journals
Opportunities for new public-private partnerships for data stewardship 
also exist. For example Google had announced a free service named
 Palimpsest 
that would make massive datasets accessible to researchers, but canceled the 
of˜cial launch of the project in late 2008.
23
 At the same time, Amazon has 
launched a service to host large public datasets, allowing researchers to upload 
their own data.
24
 Researchers would be charged fees for online data storage 
and data analysis capability. Many datasets have become so large that they are 
impossible to download over the Internet in a reasonable time. 
Some journals play a role in maintaining the data submitted to support 
published articles. Journals are also participating in initiatives such as Portico, 
an archive of electronic scholarly literature.
25
 However, many journals lack the 
˜nancial resources for maintaining databases for extended periods. And many 
journals face ˜nancial constraints, especially as they make the transition to 
electronic publication, which could threaten their ability to preserve and supply 
data either now or in the future.
ANNOTATING DATA FOR LONG-TERM USE
As noted in Chapter 2, raw data are typically of use only to the research 
group that generated them. To be useful to others, data must be accompanied 
by metadata that describe the content, structure, processing, access condi
-tions, and source of the data in a form that permits the data to be used by 
researchers, educators, policy makers, and others. For computational data, for 
example, annotation might mean preserving the software used to generate the 
data along with a simulation of the hardware on which the software ran (or, 
in some cases, the hardware itself). For observational data, the documentation 
of the hardware, instrumental calibrations, preprocessing of data, and other 
circumstances of the observation are generally essential for using the data. In 
some cases, these metadata can be generated automatically, but annotation can 
be a labor-intensive process.

 DATA 
107Different types of users of data generally have different needs for annota
-tion. Researchers in the same ˜eld can be expected to need less metadata than 
a researcher in a quite different ˜eld or a nonresearcher. Making data usable 
in the latter case can be dif˜cult and involved, and researchers do not have a 
responsibility to make data understandable to a nonexpert. However, guidelines 
should exist for the degree of expertise required to use a dataset.
E-science that ranges widely across research ˜elds requires standardized 
interfaces and protocols to enable useful communication across widely sepa
-rated research ˜elds. However, there is a trade-off between the demands of 
 
interoperability between research ˜elds and detailed annotation within a ˜eld.
26
FOSTERING DATA STEWARDSHIP FOR 
 THE BROAD RESEARCH ENTERPRISE
Most of the discussion in this chapter involves overseeing and promoting 
data stewardship in individual ˜elds of research. There is also the question of 
how the broad research enterprise should develop data management standards 
and long-term strategies across all ˜elds of research, both within and outside 
government. Many issues are common to multiple ˜elds. 
In late 2007, the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Sustainable Digital Preser
-vation and Access was created to ﬁanalyze previous and current models for 
sustainable digital preservation, and identify current best practices among 
existing collections, repositories and analogous enterprises.ﬂ
27
 The Task Force 
is developing recommendations and a research agenda aimed at catalyzing and 
supporting sustainable economic models for stewardship of digital information, 
including research data. The Task Force is supported by NSF, the Andrew 
W. Mellon Foundation, and several other organizations. NSF™s DataNet pro
-gram, described earlier in this chapter, is seeking to develop technologies and 
organizational capabilities that would be broadly applicable to long-term data 
stewardship in science and engineering.
Within the U.S. federal government, the Interagency Working Group on 
Digital Data under the National Science and Technology Council has been 
examining the needs for preservation and dissemination of publicly funded 
research data. In January 2009 the working group released its report, 
Harness

 and

. The report provided goals 
and implementation plans for the federal government to work, as both leader 
and partner, with other sectors to enable reliable and effective digital data 
preservation and access. The working group noted, as we have in this report, 
that ﬁcommunities of practice are an essential feature of the digital landscapeﬂ

and that ﬁpreservation of digital scienti˜c data is both a government and private 
sector responsibility and bene˜ts society as a whole.ﬂ To provide reliable man
-agement of digital scienti˜c data, the working group calls for ﬁa comprehensive 
framework of transparent, evolvable, extensible policies and management and 
organizational structures that provide reliable, effective access to the full spec
-trum of public digital scienti˜c data.ﬂ
The goals and recommendations of the working group are complementary 
to those of our committee. The working group recommends that federal agen
-cies ﬁpromote a data management planning process for projects that generate 
preservation data.ﬂ These plans should identify the types of data and their 
expected impact, specify relevant standards, and outline provisions for protec
-tion, access, and continuing preservation. The working group™s report points 
out that not all digital scienti˜c data need to be preserved and not all preserved 
data need to be preserved inde˜nitely. Stakeholders that should be involved 
in decisions about which data to preserve include research communities, data 
professionals, data users, entities such as professional organizations and govern
-ments, and preservation organizations.
In addition, the working group calls for the creation of a subcommittee 
on digital scienti˜c data preservation, access, and interoperability under the 
National Science and Technology Council that would track and recommend 
policies on such issues as national and international coordination; education 
and workforce development; interoperability; data systems implementation and 
deployment; and data assurance, quality, discovery, and dissemination.
At the nongovernmental level, in fall 2008 the National Research
 Council 
established a new Board on Research Data and Information. The board is engaged 
in planning, program development, and administrative oversight of projects deal
-ing with the management, policy, and use of digital data and information for 
science and the broader society. The board™s primary objectives are to:
1.
 Address emerging issues in the management, policy, and use of research 
data and information at the national and international levels.
2.
 Through studies and reports of the National Research Council, provide 
independent and objective advice, reviews of programs, and assessment of pri
-orities concerning research data and information activities and interests of its 
sponsors.
3.
 Encourage and facilitate collaboration across disciplines, sectors, and 
nations with regard to common interests in research data and information 
activities.
4.
 Initiate or respond to requests for consensus studies, workshops, confer
-ences, and other activities within the board™s mission, and provide oversight for 
the activities performed under the board™s auspices.
5.
 Broadly disseminate and communicate the results of the board™s activi
-ties to its stakeholders and to the general public.

GENERAL PRINCIPLE FOR ENHANCING 
 THE STEWARDSHIP OF RESEARCH DATA
Data are a critical part of the research infrastructure, with an importance 
comparable to that of laboratories, research facilities, and computing devices 
and networks. Researchers need to access data quickly and from multiple 
sources. Data need to be annotated so that they can be used by researchers in a 
wide variety of ˜elds. Data need to be migrated to successive storage platforms 
as technologies evolve. These observations lead to the committee™s third general 
principle.
Data Stewardship Principle: Research data should be retained to serve 
future uses. Data that may have long-term value should be documented, ref
-erenced, and indexed so that others can ˜nd and use them accurately and 
appropriately.
As with the two previous broad principles, this principle is not a recom
-mendation but a general statement of intent that can guide speci˜c actions. 
Also, as with the Data Access and Sharing Principle, the Data Stewardship 
Principle™s reference to future uses should be seen as limiting rather than broad
-ening the scope of the principle. Decisions must continually be made about 
which data to save and which data to discard. General heuristics offer some 
guidance on these decisions.
28
 Observational data that cannot be re
-collected 
are candidates for being archived inde˜nitely. Experimental data may or may 
not be saved depending on whether the experimental conditions can be repro
-duced precisely at minimal cost. In general, decisions about data retention 
require focused attention within each research group and ˜eld.
Many critical questions involving the retention of data are not directly 
addressed by the Data Stewardship Principle. For how long should data be 
retained? In what format and by whom? Who should pay for the preservation 
of data? These questions can be answered only by the researchers, research 
institutions, research sponsors, and policy makers who have responsibility for 
data stewardship.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF RESEARCHERS
As with ensuring the integrity and accessibility of data, researchers have 
unique responsibilities for data stewardship. As stated in an editorial for its 
issue on ﬁpetabyte science,ﬂ which appeared in September 2008, the journal 
Nature
 states that ﬁResearchers need to be obliged to document and manage

their data with as much professionalism as they devote to their experiments. 
And they should receive greater support in this endeavor than they are afforded 
at present.ﬂ
29
Through their planning and actions, researchers facilitate or complicate the 
retention of data. Researchers need to provide much of the metadata that can 
allow data to be used in the future by colleagues who may be in quite different 
˜elds. Only the researchers and data professionals directly involved in a project 
know their data well enough to judge what should be preserved and what should 
be discarded. The heterogeneity of data and the variety of possible needs argue 
that policies and strategies be set by those within a ˜eld, not outside it.
Among the most important tasks for researchers establishing a data man
-agement plan is to arrange for preserved data to be annotated in such a way that 
they retain their long-term value. Annotation might include computer codes, 
algorithms, or other processing techniques used in the course of research. 
Furthe
rmore, this information should be suf˜cient to allow other researchers 
not only to verify previous results but to extend those results into new areas. 
Data stewardship must start at the beginning of a project, not partway 
through or at the end of a project. 
Recommendation
 9:
 Researchers
 should

 data
 management
 plans
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 each
 research
 project
 that
 include
 appropriate
 pro
visions
 for
 the

 data.
At a minimum, data management plans for research projects should pro
-vide for compliance with the relevant legal and policy requirements covering 
research data. These would include institutional policies, sponsor requirements, 
federal law (e.g. the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), 
and state law as appropriate. Under certain circumstances (e.g., when the data 
can be reproduced cheaply, no secondary use is anticipated), provisions for 
stewardship of the data beyond what is legally required may not be necessary. 
In other cases, the data management plan would specify whether the data would 
be deposited in an institutional and/or disciplinary repositories, annotation and 
metadata speci˜cations, and other elements. 
This recommendation does not imply that individual researchers are 
responsible for ensuring inde˜nite preservation of their own data, only that 
they ensure that it is prepared and transferred to the appropriate archives or 
repositories. Also, researchers should be working in partnership with their 
institutions, sponsors, and ˜elds in formulating and implementing their plans. 
Researchers need to participate in the development of policies and stan
-dards for data access, annotation, and preservation, including standards regard

As research data become more voluminous, complex, and valuable, a 
need may arise to formalize the process of making data management decisions 
within research ˜elds. As with data access and data integrity, international 
participation may be needed in the development of data management stan
-dards, or international organizations might take the lead role. Often ad hoc 
groups can provide guidance, such as National Research Council commit
-tees, federal agency advisory groups, or collaborative efforts such as the one 
undertaken by the Ecological Society of America and described in Box 4-2. 
In some ˜elds it might become desirable to charge a data oversight board 
with this
 responsibility. Such a board could serve many functions including 
the following:

Make recommendations about whether data should be stored in special 
repositories or by individuals.

Determine how long particular kinds of data need to be preserved and 
who is responsible for the quality of the data as they move from one storage 
platform to another.

Inventory and publicize good practices for data management.

Conduct assessments of which datasets offer the most potential future 
value and which can be sacri˜ced.

Organize interactions with specialized support organizations, either 
nonpro˜t or commercial, to store and distribute data.

Evaluate access and preservation to identify problems and ensure that 
data with the greatest potential utility are being preserved.
As was discussed in Chapter 3, science, engineering, and medical research 
is a global enterprise. A wide range of governmental and private entities around 
the world have developed expertise in areas related to data stewardship, many 
working at the level of disciplines and ˜elds.

biotechnology, ozone depletion, species extinction, and many other topics.
a All of

b Funded by 
the 
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Ithaka, the Library of Congress, and JSTOR, Portico 
was launched in 2005 and has almost 6 million journal articles archived. The ESA 
requires that data and information on methods and materials needed to verify conclu
-sions be made available to editors of its journals on request, and strongly encourages 
authors to register their data in ESA™s of˚cial registry (data.esa.org).
 ESA also has devoted considerable attention to making unpublished foundational 
data accessible. In 2004 it formed a joint working group to promote data sharing and 
archiving. Representatives of the working group came from many organizations and a 
wide range of ˚elds. Over the course of three meetings, the working group discussed 
the promotion and design of data registries,

 Research institutions and research sponsors have an interest in seeing data 
used to full advantage. Research data represent a sizable investment of human 
and ˜nancial resources, and preserving those data typically costs less than 
generating them in the ˜rst place. Nevertheless, maintaining high-quality and 
reliable databases can have signi˜cant costs. Because future uses of data are 
dif˜cult to predict, the return on those costs can be uncertain. In many ˜elds, 
there still is no consensus as to who should maintain large databases or who 
should bear the costs.
Depending on the ˜eld, data management plans might include incentives 
for proper data stewardship (including research sponsor policies and conditions 
for grants and contracts), investments in technological and institutional tools, 
standardization of interfaces, and the support of data centers. The examples 
of the Ecological Society of America and ICPSR (Boxes 4-1 and 4-2) show 
how ˜elds and coalitions of ˜elds can develop policies and capacity for data 
stewardship over time.
Research institutions, including research libraries, can play leadership roles 
in the stewardship of research data, both those produced by their own faculties 
and more broadly. As with the preservation of scholarship in the print era, not 
every institution will be positioned to develop comprehensive capabilities by 
itself. Coalitions and partnerships among institutions and between institutions 
and agencies can accomplish much of this work. 
It is important that requirements for improved data management prac
-tices not be imposed as unfunded mandates. They need to be integrated into 
research program funding as an essential component of the conduct of research. 
Where possible, grant applications should include costs for data stewardship.
The questions of who pays, how much, and for how long are at the heart 
of the problem of how to ensure long-term stewardship of research data. It has 
been suggested that only the federal government is positioned to guarantee 
the preservation of research data, and that a federal data archive or system of 
archives analogous to the Library of Congress should be established to under
-take this mission. 
This chapter discusses the variety of federal resources and programs related 
to research data stewardship that already exist, many of which involve partner
-ships of various types with research ˜elds and research institutions. Many of 
them are relatively new. This committee was not in a position to comprehen
-sively evaluate whether the current, largely decentralized, approach is likely to 
meet the needs of the research enterprise. The relevant communities are actively 
engaged in addressing these issues, through groups such as the Blue Ribbon 
Task Force for Sustainable Digital Preservation and Access mentioned earlier.

ASSIGNING ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Periods of rapid technological change offer strong incentives as well as 
unique opportunities for examining current policies and instituting new poli
-cies to address changing circumstances. Every part of the research enterprise 
is being affected by the changes in how research is being planned, conducted, 
and used, and each has responsibilities for ensuring the integrity, accessibility, 
and stewardship of research data. However, shared responsibilities can create 
problems. When responsibility is shared, each group can assume that the other 
groups should be the ones taking action. As a speaker at one of the committee™s 
meetings memorably described the problem, ﬁIf two people are responsible for 
feeding a dog, that dog™s going to starve.ﬂ
The remainder of this chapter revisits the recommendations made in the 
three preceding chapters by brie˚y describing the roles and responsibilities of 
the major sectors of the research enterprise in ensuring the integrity, accessibility, 
and stewardship of research data. In that regard, it functions as a summary of the 
report™s recommendations, though the recommendations are resorted according 
to the groups responsible for each action (see Table 5-1). It also discusses some 
of the particular responsibilities incumbent on parts of the research enterprise to 
avoid inaction caused by an overly diffuse allocation of responsibilities.
RESEARCHERS
Researchers have particular obligations in each of the three areas discussed 
in this report. As data producers, providers, and users, they know best how to 
generate data of high quality, disseminate data to others so that the data are 
useful, and preserve the data for future uses. In some ˜elds they may need to 
work in close association with data professionals. They might also carry out

their responsibilities through informal groups or formal organizations created 
with the involvement of funding agencies or professional societies.
In a period of rapid technological change, researchers can be challenged 
to master all of the information they need to ful˜ll their responsibilities toward 
data. Training in the responsible conduct of research that includes guidance on 
the management of data can clarify and emphasize researchers™ responsibilities 
(Chapter 2). Many research data have potential uses and users that may not be 
obvious from the perspective of a single research ˜eld. Courses, seminars, or 
Web-based modules in data management can list and describe these potential 
uses and users, providing researchers with a more comprehensive set of factors 
to consider in making decisions about data accessibility and stewardship.
Researchers also need to be aware of the many considerations surrounding 
data when they are considering possible restrictions on data and the appropri
-ateness of any such restrictions (Chapter 3). Restrictions may be necessary, yet 
most restrictions on the accessibility of data have costs for the research commu
-nity. Because of these costs, researchers have a responsibility to provide compel
-ling reasons for any limitations on the accessibility of data, which requires that 
they fully understand and are able to justify these limits.
Finally, researchers are the ones best positioned to plan both how data will 
be made available and how they will be preserved and curated for long-term use 
(Chapter 4). When standards for data accessibility and stewardship do not exist 
in a ˜eld, researchers need to be involved inŠand most likely will leadŠthe 
process of developing such standards.
The integrity, accessibility, and stewardship of research data are too impor
-tant to be secondary considerations or afterthoughts in the development of a 
research plan. Provisions for maintaining these three qualities of research data 
should be part of every research plan, whether a sponsor requires such provi
-sions or not.
RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS
Research institutions, including colleges, universities, medical schools, and 
other nonpro˜t organizations, have a major in˚uence on the policy environ
-ment in which research is conducted. Their supportŠor lack of supportŠfor 
data integrity, accessibility, and stewardship can have a major effect on the 
quality and usability of research data. Research institutions need to have clear 
 
written policies regarding data management and communicate these policies to 
researchers. Organizations such as the National Association of State Universi
-ties and Land-Grant Colleges, the American Association of Universities, the 
Committee on Government Relations, the Committee on Institutional Coopera
-tion, and others can help formulate and disseminate these policies.
Research institutions need to support training in data management (Chap
-ter 2). They should establish an expectation that researchers will undertake

9such training and provide the ˜nancial support for researchers to be able to do 
so. Research institutions and sponsors also facilitate the development of data 
professionals by providing career paths for these individuals, supporting their 
training, and recognizing and rewarding their contributions.
Researchers have many incentives for maintaining the integrity of the 
data they generate. They have fewer incentives, in general, for making their 
data widely available, and fewer still to invest the time and resources needed 
to ensure the stewardship of data. Policy initiatives are therefore essential if 
research data are to achieve their maximum value.
Research institutions have a special responsibility to be proactive in
 making 
research data accessible (Chapter 3). Research grants and contracts typically 
give research institutions ownership rights in research data, and so those insti
-tutions have a particular interest in seeing that research data are available, that 
restrictions on the accessibility of research data are justi˜ed, and that proce
-dures exist for responding to requests for research data. Both formal policies 
and informal expectations help to avoid con˚icts over data accessibility.
Research institutions also can and should play the leading role in steward
-ship of its scholarship and knowledge resources (Chapter 4).
RESEARCH SPONSORS
Research sponsors, including government agencies, philanthropies, private 
companies, and other funders, also have an interest in all three of the qualities 
discussed in this report. But they have a particular responsibility toward data 
stewardship (Chapter 4). The infrastructure needed for data stewardship is 
much less developed than is the infrastructure for publishing research conclu
-sions. Also, the long-term preservation of data in a usable form can be costly, 
and research data are so varied across ˜elds that different systems are needed 
for different ˜elds.
Funders can maximize the value of the research they fund by also taking 
steps to support the stewardship of data. They need to work with researchers 
in the ˜elds they sponsor to develop incentives for researchers to invest in data 
stewardship, and they need to consider support for the data centers and tools 
that facilitate stewardship.
PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES AND JOURNALS
Finally, professional societies and journals have important roles to play in 
all three of the areas explored in this report. They can help develop and dis
-seminate guidelines for a research ˜eld and then help monitor and enforce com
-pliance with those guidelines. Journals are directly responsible for the long-term 
preservation of the articles they publish, and an increasing number of journals 
are assuming responsibility for maintaining the data on which research conclu

sions are based. And journals and professional societies can help ensure that the 
contributions of data professionals are recognized and rewarded through such 
mechanisms as prizes, publication, and recognition at disciplinary meetings.
In general, more dialog is needed among researchers, research institutions, 
and research sponsors about the need for education and training, how spon
-sors should support the stewardship of data, the role of data professionals, and 
how institutions and sponsors should respond to reasonable and unreasonable 
requests for research data. Professional societies and journals can catalyze these 
dialogues within research ˜elds, providing a base of knowledge that can then 
be applied across disciplines.
CONCLUSION
During periods of rapid change, an emphasis on speci˜c policies may be 
less useful than reiterating and reemphasizing the fundamental principles that 
should guide action. Thus, we close by restating three general principles that 
have motivated our recommendations in the areas of data integrity, accessibility, 
and stewardship.
Data Integrity Principle: Ensuring the integrity of research data is essential for 
advancing scienti˜c, engineering, and medical knowledge and for maintaining 
public trust in the research enterprise. Although other stakeholders in the 
research enterprise have important roles to play, researchers themselves are 
ultimately responsible for ensuring the integrity of research data.
Data Access and Sharing Principle: Research data, methods, and other infor
-mation integral to publicly reported results should be publicly accessible. 
Data Stewardship Principle: Research data should be retained to serve 
future uses. Data that may have long-term value should be documented, ref
-erenced, and indexed so that others can ˜nd and use them accurately and 
appropriately.

Biographical Information on the 
 Members of the Committee on 
 Ensuring the Utility and Integrity of 
Research Data in a Digital Age
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
DANIEL KLEPPNER
, Co-Chair, is professor emeritus at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT) and co-director of the MIT-Harvard Center for 
Ultracold Atoms. He has made fundamental contributions to atomic physics 
and quantum optics. His research encompasses spectroscopic tests of extreme 
precision and novel quantum phenomena. He was director of the MIT-Harvard 
Center for Utracold Atoms from 2000 to 2006, and from 1987 to 2000 he was 
associate director of the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics. In 1960, 
along with Norman Ramsey, he developed the Hydrogen maser, later used as an 
atomic clock of unprecedented stability. Applications of this early work range 
from coordination of radio signals in long-baseline radio astronomy, to satellite-
based global positioning systems. 
 In the 1970s, Dr. Kleppner was a pioneer in the physics of Rydberg atoms, 
demonstrating the inhibition of spontaneous emission from them. This was a 
pioneering step in the development of cavity quantum electrodynamics, the 
study of the radiative properties of atoms in con˜ned spaces. Kleppner™s inves
-tigations of Rydberg atom spectra in high electric and magnetic ˜elds pro
-vided deep physical insight into the implications of classical chaos for quantum 
systems. 
  Professor Kleppner and MIT colleague Professor Thomas Greytak were 
among the ˜rst to search for quantum degeneracy effects in ultra-cold gases. 
After a 20-year-long quest, in 1998, they achieved Bose-Einstein condensation 
(BEC) in hydrogen. In the meanwhile, they developed tools instrumental to the 
1995 discovery of BEC in alkali atoms by MIT alumni Eric Cornell and Carl 
Wieman, and MIT™s Wolfgang Ketterle. These include the technique of evapo
-rative cooling, developed in collaboration with Harald Hess. Bose-Einstein

 Acondensates and fermionic degenerate samples of cold atoms represent a new 
form of matter at the lowest temperatures ever achieved. These species are now 
the subject of intense investigation in laboratories around the world.
 In addition to these research achievements, Dr. Kleppner has been a dedi
-cated teacher at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and has served on 
numerous national committees charged with investigating key scienti˜c or 
social issues. His honors include election to the National Academy of Sciences, 
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical 
Society, and the Academies of Science (Paris), and the Davisson-Germer Prize, 
Leo Szilard Lectureship Award and Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical 
Society, the Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers, 
the Frederick Ives Medal of the Optical Society of America, the Wolf Prize, and 
the 2006 National Medal of Science. 
PHILLIP A. SHARP, 
Co-Chair, is Institute Professor at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. Much of Dr. Sharp™s scienti˜c work has been con
-ducted at MIT™s Center for Cancer Research (now the Koch Institute), which 
he joined in 1974 and directed from 1985 to 1991. He subsequently led the 
Department of
 Biology from 1991 to 1999 and the McGovern Institute from 
2000 to 2004. His research interests have centered on the molecular biology of 
gene expression relevant to cancer and the mechanisms of RNA splicing; his 
landmark achievement was the discovery of RNA splicing in 1977. This work 
provided one of the ˜rst indications of the startling phenomenon of ﬁdiscon
-tinuous genesﬂ in mammalian cells. The discovery that genes contain nonsense 
segments that are edited out by cells in the course of utilizing genetic infor
-mation is important in understanding the genetic causes of cancer and other 
diseases. Dr. Sharp™s research opened an entirely new area in molecular biology 
and forever changed the ˜eld. For this work he shared the 1993 Nobel Prize 
in Physiology or Medicine with Dr. Richard Roberts who did work in parallel 
at Cold Spring Harbor.
 Dr. Sharp has authored more than 350 scienti˜c papers and serves on 
many scienti˜c committees, including the National Cancer Institute™s Advisory 
Board, which he chaired for two years (2000Œ2002). His work has been hon
-ored with numerous awards including the Gairdner Foundation International 
Award, General Motors Research Foundation Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. Prize for 
Cancer Research, Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize, and Albert Lasker Basic
 Medical 
Research Award. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sci
-ences, the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 
and the American Philosophical Society.
 A native of Kentucky, Dr. Sharp earned a B.A. degree from Union
 College, 
Kentucky, and a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Illinois at
 Champaign-
Urbana in 1969. He did his postdoctoral training at the California Institute of 
Technology, where he studied the molecular biology of plasmids from bacteria

Committee on Responsibilities of Authorship in the Biological Sciences, 
National Research Council
Synopsis:
 The publication of experimental results and sharing of research 
 
materials related to those results have long been key elements of the life sci
-ences. Over time, standard practices have emerged from communities of life 
scientists to facilitate the presentation and sharing of different types of data and 
materials. But recently a concern has emerged that, in practice,
 publication-
related data and materials are not always readily available to the research 
community. This report ˜nds that the life sciences community does possess 
commonly held ideas and values about the role of publication in the scienti˜c 
process. Those ideas de˜ne the responsibilities of authors and underpin the 
development of community standards: practices for sharing data, software, and 
materials adopted by different disciplines of the life sciences to facilitate the use 
of scienti˜c information and ensure its quality. The report is a very clear and 
thorough exploration of standards and expectations for making data accessible 
in an important ˜eld. The principles developedŠthat authors are required to 
make data available as a quid pro quo for publication, that authors are obligated 
to provide data and other materials in a form on which scientists can build fur
-ther with research, and that all members of the scienti˜c community have equal 
responsibility for upholding community standardsŠare consistent with those 
recommended by this study, and represent something of a ﬁgold standardﬂ that 
other ˜elds might try to emulate.

as a whole; it provides advice to a journal editor about the importance of the 
˜ndings and whether the reported evidence supports the author™s claims. Illus
-trates the barriers to making data available, particularly in ˜elds where data 
can be used to identify individuals. Also illustrates the pros and cons of

 (2001)
Committee on Geophysical and Environmental Data, National Research 
Council
Synopsis:
 De˜nes appropriate spheres for the public and private sectors in the 
growing ˜eld of environmental data. Recommends that the public sector should 
continue to collect and synthesize data, and to provide such data at no more than 
the marginal cost of reproduction with no usage restrictions. The private sector 
would focus on value-added distribution and speci˜c observational systems.

-ity restrictions. The challenge of improving access to data with con˜dentiality 
restrictions goes across several ˜elds. 

 (2000)
Committee on Intellectual Property Rights in the Emerging Information Infra
-structure, National Research Council
Synopsis:
 In-depth examination of copyright issues, including those related to 
digital archiving, in the wake of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Relevant 
to the changing environment for scienti˜c publishing, an important aspect of 
the context for this study, as well as the role of libraries.


(1999)
Committee for a Study on Promoting Access to Scienti˜c and Technical Data 
for the Public Interest, National Research Council
Synopsis:
 Describes the importance of scienti˜c and technical databases in 
research, and standard practices for production, dissemination, and use of data 
in federal, nonpro˜t, and commercial contexts. Develops principles and guide
-lines for agencies, research institutions, and investigators. Explores various 
proposals for creating new intellectual property protection for noncopyright
-able databases current at the time of the study, along with the pros and cons 
of these proposals. The European Union had recently created such protection. 
Several of the principles and guidelines are consistent with this study, including: 
(1) scienti˜c and technical data owned or controlled by the government should 
be made available for use by not-for-pro˜t and commercial entities alike on a 
nonexclusive basis and should be disseminated to all users at no more than the 
marginal cost of reproduction and distribution, whenever possible; (2) federal 
funding agencies should require university and other not-for pro˜t researchers 
or their employing institutions that use federal funds, wholly or in substantial 
part, in creating databases not to grant exclusive rights to such databases when

submitting them for publication or for incorporation into other databases. Also 
provides a good overview of intellectual property issues related to data. Data 
itself is not copyrightable, and there are signi˜cant limitations on copywriting 
databases. The policy context has not changed much since the time of this 
report, as the United States and other nations have not followed the European 
Union to create new intellectual property protection for databases. 

 (1999)
Committee on Federal Policy for Access to Research, Resources, National 
Research Council
Synopsis:
 This conference summary describes issues affecting access to a vari
-ety of research resources in the life sciences, including data and databases, 
 
materials, software, and so forth. Provides background on data access issues 
in the life sciences. The recommendations are largely superseded by

Jonathan R. Davis, 
Vivian P. Nolan, Janet Woodcock, and Ronald W.
 Estabrook, 
Editors, Institute of Medicine
Synopsis:
 Describes the process for assuring the integrity of clinical trial data and 
suggests improvements. Background to the issues of clinical trials data discussed 
in this study.

(1997)
Committee on Issues in the Transborder Flow of Scienti˜c Data, National 
Research Council
Synopsis:
 Outlines the needs for access to data in the physical, astronomical, 
geological, and biological sciences. Characterizes the legal, economic, policy, 
and technical factors and trends that have an in˚uence on access to data by the 
scienti˜c community. Identi˜es and analyzes the barriers to international access 
to scienti˜c data. Recommends approaches that could help overcome those 
barriers. The two key challenges are the increasing quantities, varieties, dissemi
-nation modes, and interdisciplinary relevance of data, and increasing legal and 
economic restrictions on publicly funded data. States the principle that ﬁfull 
and open access to scienti˜c data should be adopted as the international norm 
for the exchange of scienti˜c data derived from publicly funded research. The 
public-good interests in the full and open access to and use of scienti˜c data 
need to be balanced against legitimate concerns for the protection of national 
security, individual privacy, and intellectual property.ﬂ This study would extend 
this principle somewhat, to include private-sector-funded data on which pub
-lished research results are based.

Stephen E. Fienberg, Margaret E. Martin, and Miron L. Straf, Editors, Com
-mittee on National Statistics, National Research Council
Synopsis:
 Explores advantages of and barriers to sharing social sciences data. 
Early exploration of the idea of asking researchers to provide a data dissemina
-tion plan in their proposals, including ﬁthe time of release of data, the means by 
which the data would be made available and preserved for long-term use, the 
technical form in which data would be released, the supporting documentation 
that would accompany the data, what forms of access to con˜dential or other 
sensitive data would be provided, and an assessment of the policy relevance and 
broad research value of the data.ﬂ
