departmental, institutional, and national needs can be met.
RECOMMENDATION 1: The leaders of the institutions of higher 
education that have experienced rapid increases in computer science 
course enrollments should take deliberate actions to address this 
trend with a sense of urgency. 
RECOMMENDATION 2: A range of actions should be considered 
as part of a comprehensive institutional strategy, from targeted con
-trols on enrollments or resource additions to meet demand, to more 
extensive institutional changes that extend beyond the computer 
science department. 
RECOMMENDATION 2.1: Institutions experiencing a computer 
science enrollment surge should seriously consider an increase in 
resources to address the rising workload on faculty and staff in com
-puter science and related departments, and the limitations arising 
from inadequate facilities.
RECOMMENDATION 2.2: Some institutions may view the imposi
-tion of limits on enrollment in computer science and related courses 
as desirable or unavoidable. However, before imposing limits on 
Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate EnrollmentsCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.SUMMARY
 9course or major enrollments, the consequences of doing so should 

for the entire university community.
RECOMMENDATION 2.3: Institutional leadership should engage 
directly with computer science departments or programs to develop 
appropriate faculty hiring and faculty size targets, and develop strate
-gies to improve faculty retention. Increasing the number and enhanc
-ing the role of academic-rank teaching faculty should be given serious 
consideration.
RECOMMENDATION 2.4: Larger institutionsŠin particular, re
-search universitiesŠshould reevaluate the organizational placement 
of the computer science department and other departmental units 
with a computational mission. 
RECOMMENDATION 2.5: Institutions should pursue innovative 
strategies for using technology to deliver high-quality instruction at 
scale to large numbers of students, and pursue additional, creative 
strategies for meeting demand for quality computer science courses 
and skills development among the entire student body. 
RECOMMENDATION 3: Institutions should take deliberate actions 
to support diversity in their computer science and related programs. 
In particular: 
RECOMMENDATION 3.1: Institutions should assess how com
-puter science enrollment growthŠand any actions or strategies for 
responding to itŠaffects the diversity of their student bodies, and 
deliberately align their actions and the culture of their programs 
with best practices for diversity and retention.
RECOMMENDATION 3.2: Institutions should leverage the increas
-
majors and intended majors, to engage, recruit, and retain more 



the diversity problem proactively.
RECOMMENDATION 4: The National Science Foundation (NSF) 
can be especially helpful in advancing undergraduate computer 
science education in the context of increasing enrollments, for both 
majors and non-majors. The following actions should receive seri
-ous consideration:
Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate EnrollmentsCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.10 THE GROWTH OF COMPUTER SCIENCE UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENTS
RECOMMENDATION 4.1: Use NSF™s convening power to bring 
computer science faculty and institutional leaders together to iden
-tify best practices and innovation in computer science education 
in times of limited departmental resources. This should include 
assessment of the computer science skills and knowledge needed in 
nonŒcomputer science academic disciplines.
RECOMMENDATION 4.2: Support research on how best to use 
technology in teaching large classes. Such research should be multi
-disciplinary, spanning learning sciences, educational pedagogy for 
computer science, development and deployment of assessment instru
-ments, and technology design. 
RECOMMENDATION 4.3: Support research to advance the 
under
 
standing of best practices for diversity in computing, includ
-
insti
 
tutional practices, especially those taken or considered in times 
of high enrollments. This research should be multidisciplinary, 
with experts in both micro- and macro-level social science research, 
 
statistics, computer science education, and diversity in STEM (sci
-ence, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and computing.
RECOMMENDATION 4.4: Create an initiative to expand instruc
-tional resources in computer science, informed by an understand
-ing of the constraints and dynamics of the supply and demand for 
computer science Ph.D.s. This might include research support and 
doctoral fellowships for domestic computer science under
 graduates, and support for incorporating teaching into computer science doc
-toral programs and junior faculty research. 
RECOMMENDATION 5: Computer science departments and 
the computing industry should develop new partnerships to help 
higher education meet workforce needs, continue to graduate well-
 prepared students, encourage industry to provide increased support 
for research funding, and allow a better exchange of Ph.D.-level 
researchers between academia and industry.

-
-port to their public institutions to enable them to support fully 
their academic missions, including with respect to computer science 
education. 
Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate EnrollmentsCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.SUMMARY
 11RECOMMENDATION 7: To prepare students better for the ex
-panding role of computing in academia, industry, and daily life 
underlying the increase in interest in computer science,  
 
government 
agencies and states should support local, state, and national pro
-grams for computing education for the purpose of increasing expo
-sure to computing, computational principles, information security, 
and data analytics throughout the K-12 pipeline. 
RECOMMENDATION 8: Actions should be taken to facilitate an 
improved understanding of national undergraduate enrollment 
trends by improving the primary data available about them, and 
facilitating the availability of those data in a timely fashion. In par
-ticular, the following actions should be considered:
RECOMMENDATION 8.1: Improved data sources about under
-graduate enrollment should be pursued by federal and state gov
-ernments in collaboration with academic institutions. To the extent 
possible, data should be made available in a time frame where the 
information can be useful for academic and government planning 
purposes.

undergraduate computing degrees and jobs should be reexamined 
and updated, so that those used in national statistics are more easily 
brought into alignment, and map more directly to the current orga

RECOMMENDATION 1: The leaders of the institutions of higher 
education that have experienced rapid increases in computer science 
course enrollments should take deliberate actions to address this 
trend with a sense of urgency.

issues and elements that the committee calls out here. The committee also notes 

-




-






-
RECOMMENDATION 2.1: Institutions experiencing a computer 
science enrollment surge should seriously consider an increase in 
resources to address the rising workload on faculty and staff in com
-puter science and related departments, and the limitations arising 
from inadequate facilities.





-









RECOMMENDATION 2.2: Some institutions may view the imposi
-tion of limits on enrollment in computer science and related courses 
as desirable or unavoidable. However, before imposing limits on 
Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate EnrollmentsCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.RECOMMENDATIONS
 149course or major enrollments, the consequences of doing so should 

for the entire university community.









-
-









RECOMMENDATION 2.3: Institutional leadership should engage 
directly with computer science departments or programs to develop 
appropriate faculty hiring and faculty size targets, and develop 
strategies to improve faculty retention. Increasing the number and 
enhancing the role of academic-rank teaching faculty should be 
given serious consideration. 


-



-





-


Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate EnrollmentsCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.150 THE GROWTH OF COMPUTER SCIENCE UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENTS

-

-

RECOMMENDATION 2.4: Larger institutionsŠin particular, re
-search universitiesŠshould reevaluate the organizational placement 
of the computer science department and other departmental units 
with a computational mission. 


-





RECOMMENDATION 2.5: Institutions should pursue innovative 
strategies for using technology to deliver high-quality instruction 
at scale to large numbers of students. Institutions should also pur
-sue additional, creative strategies for meeting demand for quality 
computer science courses and skills development among the entire 
student body. 






and work with education researchers to better understand how students learn and 

-






RECOMMENDATION 3: Institutions should take deliberate ac
-tions to support diversity in computer science and related programs. 
In particular:
Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate EnrollmentsCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.RECOMMENDATIONS
 151RECOMMENDATION 3.1: Institutions should assess how com
-puter science enrollment growth, and any actions or strategies for 
responding to it, affects the diversity of their student bodies, and  
deliberately align their actions and the culture of their programs 
with best practices for diversity and retention.







RECOMMENDATION 3.2: Institutions should leverage the increas
-
majors and intended majors, to engage, recruit, and retain more 

-dress the diversity problem proactively.

-

RECOMMENDATION 4: The National Science Foundation (NSF) 
can be especially helpful in advancing undergraduate computer 
science education in the context of increasing enrollments, for both 
majors and non-majors. The following actions should receive seri
-ous consideration:
RECOMMENDATION 4.1: Use NSF™s convening power to bring 
computer science faculty and institutional leaders together to iden
-tify best practices and innovation in computer science education 
in times of limited departmental resources. This should include 
assessment of the computer science skills and knowledge needed in 
nonŒcomputer science disciplines.
RECOMMENDATION 4.2: Support research on how best to use 
technology in teaching large classes. Such research should be multi
-disciplinary, spanning learning sciences, educational pedagogy for 
computer science, development and deployment of assessment in
-struments, and technology design. 
RECOMMENDATION 4.3: Support research to advance the 
under
 
standing of best practices for diversity in computing, includ
-
insti
 
tutional practices, especially those taken or considered in times 
Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate EnrollmentsCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.152 THE GROWTH OF COMPUTER SCIENCE UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENTS
of high enrollments. This research should be multidisciplinary, with 
experts in both micro- and macro-level social science research, sta
-tistics, computer science education, and diversity in STEM and 
computing.
RECOMMENDATION 4.4: Create an initiative to expand instruc
-tional resources in computer science, informed by an understand
-ing of the constraints and dynamics of the supply and demand for 
computer science Ph.D.s. This might include research support and 
doctoral fellowships for domestic computer science under
 graduates, and support for incorporating teaching into computer science doc
-toral programs and junior faculty research. 
RECOMMENDATION 5: Computer science departments and 
the computing industry should develop new partnerships to help 
higher education meet workforce needs, continue to graduate well-
 prepared students, encourage industry to provide increased support 
for research funding, and allow a better exchange of Ph.D.-level 
 
researchers between academia and industry. 
Academic institutions should pursue new partnerships with industry and to 






fraction of each state™s workforce and the nation™s computer sci
-
-port to their public institutions to enable them to support fully 
their academic missions, including with respect to computer science 
education. 

-



RECOMMENDATION 7: To prepare students better for the ex
-panding role of computing in academia, industry, and daily life 
underlying the increase in interest in computer science, government 
agencies and states should support local, state, and national pro
-grams for computing education for the purpose of increasing expo
-Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate EnrollmentsCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.RECOMMENDATIONS
 153sure to computing, computational principles, information security, 
and data analytics throughout the K-12 pipeline. 


-


RECOMMENDATION 8: Actions should be taken to facilitate an 
improved understanding of national undergraduate enrollment 
trends by improving the primary data available about them and 
facilitating the availability of that data in a timely fashion. In par
-ticular, the following actions should be considered:
RECOMMENDATION 8.1: Improved data sources about under
-graduate enrollment should be pursued by federal and state gov
-ernments in collaboration with academic institutions. To the extent 
possible, data should be made available in a time frame where the 
information can be useful for academic and government planning 
purposes.
