Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 1       Summary
   At the request of the Director of 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (
NIST
), in 
2015 the National 
Research Council
1 formed the Panel on Review of the Information Technology 
Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and 
formulated 
the following statement 
of task for the panel:
  The National Research Council 
shall appoint a panel to assess the scientific and technical work 
performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology 
Laboratory. This panel will review technical reports and technical program descriptions prepared
 by NIST staff and will visit the facilities at the Information Technology Laboratory. Visits will 
include technical presentations by NIST staff, demonstrations of NIST projects, tours of NIST 
facilities, and discussions with NIST staff. The panel will pre
pare a report summarizing its 
assessment findings.
   NIST specified that three of the six divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory 
(ITL) would be reviewed: 
the Information Access Division (IAD), 
the 
Software and Systems 
Division (SSD), and 
the 
Statistical Engineering Division (SED). The 
following 
ITL divisions 
were not reviewed
 because they 
had 
recently 
been 
reorganized
: the Applied and Computational 
Mathematics Division, 
the 
Computer Security Division, and 
the 
Advanced Networking 
Technologies D
ivision. 
NIST plans to request their review in the future
. The NIST 
Director 
requested that the panel focus its assessment on the following factors:
  1. Assess the organization
™s technical programs.
  How does the quality of the research compare to similar w
orld class research in the 
technical program areas?
  Is the quality of the technical programs adequate for the organization to reach its stated 
technical objectives? How could it be improved?
 2. Assess the portfolio of scientific expertise within the organi
zation.
  Does the organization have world
-class scientific expertise in the areas of the 
organization
™s mission and program objectives? If not, what areas should be improved?
  How well does the organization
™s scientific expertise support the organization
™s technical 
programs and the organization
™s ability to achieve its stated objectives?
 3. Assess the adequacy of the organization
™s facilities, equipment, and human resources
.  How well do the facilities, equipment, and human resources support the organization
™s technical programs and its ability to achieve its stated objectives? How could they be 
improved?
 4. Assess the effectiveness by which the organization disseminates its program outputs.
  How well are the organization
™s research programs driven by stakehol
der needs?
  How effective are the technology transfer mechanisms used by the organization? Are 
                                                      1 Effective July 1, 2015, the institution is called the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine. Refer

  How well is the organization monitoring stakeholder use and impact of program outputs? 
How could this be improved?
   This 
summary presents general observations about the ITL divisions reviewed and observations 
and recommendations specific to the divisions reviewed.
 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
  ITL
 has a unique role as 
convener 
and facilitator of research and technology developm
ent. This 
role
 of 
the 
Laboratory
 and
, more broadly
, of NIST, 
is of 
great 
importance to the 
nation
. ITL has a very 
broad range of projects, some with 
significant influence on 
public policy
, such as the
 projects 
on voting,
 health
-related
 information technology
, forensics, and cyberphysical 
and cybersecurity 
systems
. Resources 
are spread thin, even in these key projects.
 As described below, each division faces special challenges 
with respect to needed expertise and numbers of researchers. 
While t
here was 
modest
 evidence of a 
systematic, data
-driven process of planning for personnel and resou
rces, both short
- and long
-term
, this 
planning needs improvement. 
  The ability to respond successfully to mandates and to generate new research project
s in support 
of its core mission is 
essential to ITL. 
There was modest 
evidence of systematic 
horizon
-scanning in the 
realms of government, industry, and the science
s, but 
ITL needs to improve its horizon scanning
.  The role of 
convener 
and facilitator of 
research and technology development is a major part of 
ITL
™s contribution. However,
 ITL
™s outreach
 activities do not seem to make optimal use of current 
Internet
-based capabilities.
  DIVISION
-SPECIFIC OBSERVATION
S, CONCLUSIONS, AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS
 Informat
ion Access Division
  The technical programs in the IAD are
, in general
, well organized, well
 staffed, and appropriate 
to the mission of ITL and
 to 
the
 IAD
 itself
. The research teams enjoy broad peer recognition while 
supporting the NIST 
mission
. The core c
ompetencies and facilities in this division are strong, and 
interactions with other parts of ITL 
and NIST 
are evident, if not always formalized.
 It is important that 
while 
maintaining momentum
 and leadership
 the
 IAD also consider
 enhanc
ing
 engagement in
 new 
opportunities in areas such as data
-driven information science, security policy, and health informatics. 
There was modest evidence of ongoing critical review of programs.
   The portfolio of scientific expertise is appropriate and impressive for the tr
aditional areas that the 
IAD focuses on, but core capabilities need to be enhanced in areas where the IAD aspires to make a major 
contribution
.  Recommendation
 1: The 
Information Access Division 
should review the current and 
proposed portfolios and examine
 the adequacy of its core competencies for ambitious new 
programs like data science, health informatics, and public safety.
   Supporting the standards process 
places resource
 and attention
-span demands on personnel
. One 
option to reduce the demands 
could b
e to turn over standards materials to 
the International Organization 
for Standardization (
ISO
) and other 
standards development organizations (
SDOs
). However, this 
approach is sometimes associated with update cycles that are too long and possibly too onerou
s to meet 
the original intent of the standard, and it entails risk to IAD credibility. 
   Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 3 Recommendation
 2: The 
Information Access Division (IAD)
 should continually consider the 
pros and cons of turning over standards materials
Šfor example, the Common Indu
stry 
Format (
CIF)
Što 
the International Organization for Standardization (
ISO
) and other 
standards development organizations (
SDOs
). If the ISO
-SDO channel remains the best or 
only approach, 
the 
IAD should consider how to plan proactively for updates as 
appropriate 
and should propose updates to the controlling SDO(s) whenever IAD efforts indicate they 
are needed or desired by the user community.
   Facilities, equipment, and human resources are strong assets of IAD. As 
areas
 such as health 
informatics 
gain
 importance
, there seems to be a tendency to make do with the 
existing 
core talent areas 
rather than hiring specialists
Šfor example
, trained biomedical informaticians and health data scientists
Špermanently or even for shorter 
period
s of time. This 
practice
 needs to be reconsidered 
during 
strategic 
planning 
for 
the division. A prime example of
 where such expertise is 
need
ed is the 
electronic 
health 
record
 team.
  Recommendation
 3: The 
Information Access Division 
(IAD) 
should bolster the 
electronic 
health 
record
 team to 
ensure that this high
-profile work is well supported in terms of 
information technology
 rigor as well as domain expertise. 
IAD
 should add scientists or 
contractors with strong clinical experience, include all stakeholders (physicians, nurses
, technicians, pharmacists, and patients) in 
its 
empirical investigations, and participate in 
medical informatics communities such the American Medical Informatics 
Association(AMIA)
 and the 
congressionally
 chartered Patient
-Centered 
Outcomes 
Research Insti
tute (PCORI)
. Internally,
 the
 IAD should collaborate closely with the 
Text 
Retrieval Conference (
TREC
) team on medical tracks.
   Collaborative teamwork 
with scientists a
nd engineers inside and outside
 IAD, 
including virtual 
teamwork and in
-person interacti
ons, is of fundamental importance to the work of the IAD staff. 
  Recommendation
 4: To maximize the mechanism of virtual teams and to foster contacts 
with other laboratories, 
the 
Information Access Division 
should give greater consideration 
to the formulat
ion of clear policies and processes that support sabbaticals and appropriate 
travel.
  
 The IAD value proposition with standards and conformance toolsets 
is outstanding
 and deserves 
continued nurturing and support. Its dissemination process would be enhanced by greater use of 
Internet
-based methods.
  Recommendation
 5: The 
Information Access Division 
should apply more 
Internet
-based 
methods
 to its dissemination and outrea
ch process.
 Such 
methods 
as webinars, virtual 
meetings, and recordings
 should be considered
. Statistical Engineering Division
  The SED is well
-aligned and effective in its support of 
ITL and 
NIST missions. 
The division
™s portfolio includes a wide variety of projects, including classical statistical metrology projects such as 
those on 
mass calibration weighing designs. Other work supports national and international best statistical 
practices in metrology and the developme
nt of new methods of measurement and uncertainty 
quantification for important specialized technical applications
. The SED efforts are technically 
challenging and well
 executed.
 The division
™s scientific expertise in statistics for metrology continues to 
be among the best in the world. 
The SED continues to have a low profile in the national and international 
Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 4 technical statistics community
. If 
this profile 
were 
to be enhanced
, SED could more fully benefit from and 
contribute to current statistical research.
  Recommendation
 6: The 
Statistical Engineering Division 
should take steps to raise 
its 
profile through technical publications in statistics venues and through educational efforts to 
improve the awareness of statistics educators of the vital role of measurem
ent in data 
collection and the role of statistics in good measurement.
    Attention to both metrology and the basic statistics field needs to be a division priority to move 
both areas forward and guarantee ongoing excellence in supporting NIST priorities.
  Recommendation
 7: The 
Statistical Engineering Division 
should seek stronger ties with the 
statistical research community in terms of both publications and human resources.
    Progress has been made on human resource issues, but important challenges remain
 to provide 
technical staffing on important projects and in critical areas, as well as to anticipate future staff losses 

with potential retirement.
  Recommendation
 8: In hiring permanent employees, the 
Statistical
 Engineering Division
 (SED)
 should focus at
tention on
 (1) ensuring corporate memory of and expertise in the 
fundamental ongoing 
National Institute of Standards and Technology
 (NIST)
 standard 
reference material (SRM), calibration, and
 the 
experimental design work that has alway
s been part of the SED
 portfolio, and on
 developing new capabilities in priority areas such as 
shape metrology and greenhouse gas monitoring, which seem to be particularly thinly 
staffed; (2) maintaining high overall technical competence; (3) improving staff diversity; 
and (4) 
balancing emphases on 
the 
noncore and core areas
Šfor example, while forensics is 
a current laboratory
-wide priority and SED is a key participant
, when hiring for forensics 
the 
SED should address
 general
 expertise
, so that other more thinly staffed critical
 areas 
are not neglected.
  Recommendation
 9: The 
Statistic
al Engineering Division 
should invigorate its program of 
graduate student internships to include two to four Ph.D. students per summer
, and 
it 
should 
begin to develop a much broader and stronger pro
gram of visiting faculty 
researchers.
   Publications, presentations, interacti
ng with visiting researchers, and sponsoring interns are 
important means for engaging with the statistical and metrology communities.
  Recommendation
 10: The 
Statistical
 Engineering Division 
should monitor its yearly division 
total publications in the three categories
Šsubject
-matter journals, metrology journals, and 
statistics journals
Šand external research presentations, research visitor days, and 
internships sponsored.
 Software and Systems Division
  The SSD is engaged in several high profile areas, notably in voting, health 
information 
technology (
IT), and cyberphysical systems (CPS). 
It is crucial that the SSD, in collaboration with ITL 
and NIST management, delineate th
e risks and rewards
 of each area
 in the context of organizational 
strategy. By defining the stakeholders and success metrics, it can match competence and resources to the 
risks and rewards.
 Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 5  The SSD
 work 
on cloud computing standards has had substantial gov
ernment and industry 
impact, both within the 
United States
 and internationally. 
The 
NIST 
cloud
-computing 
reference 
architecture is now internationally accepted, and it has led to a voluntary, consensus ISO standard.
   The SSD 
group 
work
ing
 on computational
 metrology has been successful in attracting strong 
scientific collaborators in the stem
-cell t
herapy area and in collaborations that have generated
 both 
publicly distributed software and
 published scientific results. The group
™s focus could be expanded to
 a broader set of areas.
 The inherent strengths of the SSD in 
computational metrology 
might be better served 
by a sharper focus on metrology methodology issues and metrology
-related imaging standards.
  The SSD 
group 
work
ing
 on voting security and verification has 
played 
a major role 
in voting 
systems development and implementation for more than a decade. The group has a low public pro
file that 
is not commensurate with
 its contribution. 
  The SSD 
work
 on software assurance ha
s produced
 useful data
 sets that can benefit 
the 
producers 
of software tools. The group 
has 
also had success in raising awareness about the existence of these data
 sets, including databases of common software risks and security vulnerabilities
, and
 the exi
stence
 of test 
cases. The group
™s portfolio of activities 
could benefit from closer alignment with the work of other ITL 
units.
 More could be done by the SSD 
to develop effective 
software test tools and methodologies 
and 
to 
disseminate
 them
Šfor example, fo
r conformance and interoperability testing. The SSD could take a 
leading role in the development of software test tools
.   The SSD
 group working
 on cyberphysical systems and the 
Internet of 
Things has developed a 
technically sound portfolio of activity tha
t addresses some of the important issues in the area. The group 
has demonstrated leadership by launching projects such as the smart city grand challenge and the Cyber
-Physical Systems Public Working Group (CPS PWG). The recognition and engagement with the 

scientific community gained by 
the 
SSD in this area is not yet matched by a similar level of visibility and 
engagement in the industrial community
.  The SSD group
 addressing electronic health reco
rds is working hard to respond to challenging 
mandates from 
the Office of
 the National Coordinator (ONC). However
, it is not clear how the needs of 
the continuously evolving ONC strategy can best be addressed 
by ITL 
in a sustainable way. 
The current 
staff comprise
s capable computer scientists and information techno
logists but includes no 
biomedical/health informaticians
.   It would be beneficial for the SSD to increase its engagement with the scientific and industrial 
communities.
   Recommendation
 11: The 
Software and Systems Division
 not only 
should 
participate 
with 
the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC) 
joint technical committee working group 
on the
 Internet of Things
 (ISO/IEC JTC 1
/WG 10)
 and 
the 
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
(IEEE) 
project on the 
Standard for an Architectural Framework for the Internet of Things 
(P2413), 
but also 
should 
reach out to industrial consortia such as the Industrial Internet Consortium 
and the Open Interconnect Consortium. 
   
Recommendation
 12: The 
Software and Systems Division 
should make open to the scientific 
and industrial communities the framework that 
it put together for the 
Smart 
Grid, as well 
as tools and techniques developed in university projects such as 
Precision Timed (
PRET
) machines proj
ect at the University of California, Berkeley.
   
Recommendation
 13: The 
Software and Systems Division 
should look into growing 
its 
approach to timing in connection with Internet of Things applications by considering 

protocols 
that are 
robust to clock drift
.   Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 6  It is not clear that the ONC has a comprehensive strategy that allocates the tasks needed for the 
nation to achieve inter
operable EHRs and EHR systems. 
With
in this context, 
the SSD
 is faced with 
making strategic choice
s as to the most effective focus 
for 
its EHR work.
  Recommendation
 14: For 
electronic health record
s (EHR
s) the 
Software and Systems 
Division
 (SSD) 
should define a clear direction that allows it to either focus on limited 
objectives or add staff of the appropriate types to meet larger 
expectations. Because 
focusing on meaningful use of EHRs is intrinsically clinical in nature

 and the Assessment Process
  
 At the request of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the 
National 
Research Council (NRC)
1 has, since 1959, annually assembled panels of experts from academia, industry, 
medicine, and other scientific an
d engineering environments to assess the quality and effectiveness of the 
NIST measurements and standards laboratories, of which there are now seven,
2 as well as the adequacy of 
the laboratories
™ resources.
 At the request of the Director of NIST, in 2015 t
he 
NRC 
formed the Panel on Review of the 
Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and established 
the following statement of task for the panel:
  The National Research Council 
[National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine] 
shall appoint a panel to assess the scientific and technical work performed by the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory. This panel will review 
technical reports and technical pr
ogram descriptions prepared by NIST staff and will visit the 
facilities at the Information Technology Laboratory. Visits will include technical presentations by 

NIST staff, demonstrations of NIST projects, tours of NIST facilities, and discussions with NIS
T 
staff. The panel will prepare a report summarizing its assessment findings.
  The NIST 
Director 
requested that the panel focus its assessment on the following factors:
   1. Assess the organization
™s technical programs.
  How does the quality of the research
 compare to similar world class research in the 
technical program areas?
  Is the quality of the technical programs adequate for the organization to reach its stated 
technical objectives? How could it be improved?
 2. Assess the portfolio of scientific expert
ise within the organization.
  Does the organization have world
-class scientific expertise in the areas of the 
organization
™s mission and program objectives? If not, what areas should be improved?
  How well does the organization
™s scientific expertise support
 the organization
™s technical 
programs and the organization
™s ability to achieve its stated objectives?
 3. Assess the adequacy of the organization
™s facilities,
 equipment, and human resources
  How well do the facilities, equipment, and human resources suppo
rt the organization
™s technical programs and its ability to achieve its state
d objectives? How could they be 
improved?
                                                       1 Effective July 1, 2015, the institution is called the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine. References in t
his report to the National Research Council are used in an historical context identifying 
programs prior to July 1.
 2 The seven NIST laboratories are the Engineering Laboratory, the Physical Measurement Laboratory, the 
Information Technology Laboratory, th
e Material Measurement Laboratory, the Communication Technology 
Laboratory, the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, and the NIST Center for Neutron Research.
 Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 8 4. Assess the effectiveness by which the organization disseminates its program outputs.
  How well are the organization
™s research programs
 driven by stakeholder needs?
  How effective are the technology transfer mechanisms used by the organization? Are 
these mechanisms sufficiently comprehensive?
  How well is the organization monitoring stakeholder use and impact of program outputs? 

How could t
his be improved?
  
 The context of this technical assessment is the mission of NIST, which is to promote U.S. 
innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology 
in ways that enhance economic security and improve the quality o
f life. The NIST laboratories conduct 
research to anticipate future metrology and standards needs, enable new scientific and technological 
advances, and improve and refine existing measurement methods and services.
  NIST specified that three of the six div
isions of the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) 
would be reviewed: 
the Information Access Division, 
the 
Software and Systems Division, and 
the 
Statistical Engineering Division. The following ITL divisions were not reviewed
 because they 
had 
recently 
been 
reorganized
 (NIST plans to request their review in the future
): the Applied and 
Computational Mathematics Division, 
the 
Computer Security Division, and 
the 
Advanced Networking 
Technologies Division. 
In order to accomplish the assessment, the NRC assemb
led a panel of 
22 volunteers, whose expertise matches that of the work performed by 
ITL
 staff.
3   On 
June 
9-11, 2015, the panel assembled for two and a half days at the NIST facility
, during 
which it received
, in a plenary session,
 welcoming remarks from the NIST 
Associate 
Director
 for 
Laboratory Programs
, heard an overview presentation by 
ITL
 management
, and attended an interactive 
session with 
ITL
 management. Each panel member was assigned to one of the 
three
 division review 
teams
 whose expertise matched th
at of the work performed in three 
divisions of 
ITL
: the 
Information 
Access Division
, the 
Software
 and 
Systems Division
, and the Statistical Engineering Division
. The 
division review teams separately attended division
-level 
presentations and visited division laboratories. 
The panel also met in a closed session to deliberate on its findings and to define the contents of this 
assessment report.
  The panel
™s approach to the assessment relied on the experience, technical knowledg
e, and 
expertise of its members.
 The panel reviewed selected examples of the technical research performed at 
ITL; because of time constraints, it was not possible to review ITL programs and projects exhaustively. 
The examples reviewed by the panel were sel
ected by ITL. The panel
™s goal was to identify and report 
salient examples of accomplishments, challenges, and opportunities for improvement with respect to the 

factors suggested above by the Director of NIST. These examples are intended collectively to po
rtray an 
overall impression of the laboratory, while preserving useful suggestions specific to the projects and 
programs that the panel examined.
 The panel applied a largely qualitative rather than quantitative 
approach to the assessment
.  Given the necess
arily
 broad and
 nonexhaustive nature of the review, omission 
in this report 
of 
any particular 
ITL
 program or project should not be interpreted as 
implying any
 negative reflection on the 
omitted program or project.

Division
 INTRODUCTION
 The 
activities of 
the Information Access Division (IAD)
, which has 
about 
90 personnel
, are
 organized along four themes:
 multimedia information, information retrieval
, image
 processing, and 
visualization and usability. The research tea
ms enjoy broad peer recognition while supporting the NIST
™s vision of 
information technology 
(IT) 
in measurement science
 overall 
and 
in 
measurement science for 
information technology.
 The core competencies and facilities in this division are strong, and in
teractions 
with other parts of NIST and 
the 
ITL are evident, if not always formalized. 
The following sections
 in this 
chapter 
critique the work in the
 IAD along the requested dimensions of technical programs, scientific 
expertise, facilities and resources
, and dissemination of outputs. 
Examples of the division
™s work 
are 
discussed as are 
ways that the 
division could enhance the 
effectiveness, relevance
, and recognition of its 
program while continuing its fine record of success. 
 ASSESSMENT OF TECHNI
CAL PROG
RAMS
 Accomplishments
 Community Leadership
 IAD personnel provide leadership in the field through a collaborative process that helps define 
and quantify problems, so that communities of interest can address them. Some of the efforts lead to 

proposed standard
s and to standards accepted by outside 
standards development organizations 
(SDO
s), 
such as
 the International Organization for Standardization
 (ISO
) and
 the
 Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
. In some cases, as in the exchange of foren
sic transactions
, ITL laboratory 
is itself the SDO. This is a valuable service that 
the 
IAD carries out in an excellent manner.
 There are examples in this collaborative program where
 ITL
 and the 
IAD visibly drive the 
creation or advancement of important fi
elds. One such example is 
the Text Retrieval Conference (
TREC
). Over the past 25 years, 
the 
IAD has used the TREC platform to advance the metrics of performance in 
text retrieval. In particular, the community has moved from simple measures of precision est
imates based 
on simple pooling of test run data to bootstrapping of test runs that consider interactions among query, 
system, and documents.
  In the case of 
TREC for Video (
TRECVID
), the 
IAD has facilitated the identification of key tasks 
in video retrieva
l for defining system performance. Today these include semantic indexing, instance 
search, surveillance event detection, multimedia event detection, and event recounting.
 These are all tasks 
that the video retrieval community has accepted as 
a valid 
testing methodology for video retrieval 
systems.
   In collaborating with the community,
 the
 IAD has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to bring 
about shared and sustainable leadership
, affected
 by collaboration with the relevant community. Examples 
are th
e TREC steering committee,
 Interoperable Iris Exchange
 (IREX
) iris studies
, and ISO SC37 
Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 10 standards for biometrics. These collaborations cover the range of problem definition, creation of data
 sets 
with ground truths
, and performance metrics. 
The IAD has he
lped carry the problem areas to the point 
where the community can take over the effort
, when NIST involvement needs to decrease or end. In this 
connection, 
the 
IAD tends to maintain 
an effective
 balance between ongoing areas and new areas that 
emerge or ar
e mandated. 
 Competitions,
 Metrics, 
and
 Usability 
 The 
IAD has facilitated competitions with results that demonstrate state of the art in the field. 
Many competitions have high barriers to entry such as cost of equipment or hours of tests required.
 The
 IAD
 has successfully lowered the barriers to entry in 
some
 instance
s.  In the 
speaker recognition 
evaluation,
 the
 IAD has contributed by providing compact i
-vectors 
rather than terabytes of raw speech data, which would have required substantial computational 
processing 
as well as storage to 
reach
 the point where analysis could be performed.
 IAD built the Speaker 
Recognition I
-Vector challenge.
 In 
machine translation 
(MT)
, the 
IAD instigated the creation of open
-source MT toolkits to lower barriers for entry. 
The 
IAD also created ﬁlightﬂ track alternatives to large 
government evaluations (such as at
 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
 [DARPA
]) so that 
small lab
oratorie
s and researchers can participate at some level and contribute diverse and valuable ideas. 
For example, since 2006, 
the 
IAD has run open
-MT evaluations parallel to the 
Global Autonomous 
Language Exploitation (
GALE
) and 
Broad Operational Language Translatio
n (BOLT
) evaluations by 
DARPA.
  The 
IAD has driven the development of a very broad range of new metrics, practices
, and tools in 
information science and technology. Examples are numerous: 
methods for assessing the strengths 
of 
passwords, ways to estimate r
ecall, methods of handling large data
 sets, human
-targeted translation error 
rate, identification of information intrinsic to latent fingerprints, quality covariates for biometrics
, and 
biometric aging. To explain one contribution:
 the
 Metrics for Machine 
Translation Challenge 
(MetricsMaTr) evaluations evaluated machine translation metrics that led to the development of 
alternative automated MT metrics. 
In summary,
 the
 IAD has played a unique and sustained role in 
focusing worldwide efforts 
on new metrics a
nd in building machine translation metrics through launching 

and managing metrics competitions. 
The multimedia technology contributions 
of 
the
 IAD are 
complemented by leadership in the topic of visualization and usability. As an example, 
the 
IAD was 
instru
mental in creating the biometrics usability field through studies
 such as those
 that discovered 
optimal heights and angles for security scanners at port of entry kiosks.
 Opportunities and Challenges
 Data
-Driven Information Science
 A data
-driven approach is
 critical to advancing the field of 
information science and technology
. The IAD team is starting to make an important contribution in this regard. The team is actively engaged 
in generating appropriate data sets and ground truths, running meaningful tests, and facilitating new 
web-based data sites. This direction is 
very pos
itive
. There is also an opportunity for 
the 
IAD to expand its 
vision beyond labeled data to include live data and to establish a methodology where larger numbers of 
candidate algorithms can be investigated through continuous evaluations. This is an industr
y-wide 
opportunity and trend, with implications 
for 
how 
to address ground truths and atypical events. 
 Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 11 Baseline Implementations 
 A useful service that 
the 
IAD provides is harvesting and providing baseline implementation 
information to spur further research
Šsupporting 
the concept of 
ﬁbuilding on the shoulders of others.
ﬂ The challenge is how to extend this from a closed environment to a larger community of researchers
, thus 
lowering the bar 
for 
introducing novel
 ideas into the mix. On a related theme
, many r
esearchers now offer 
open
-source or 
matrix laboratory (
MATLAB
®) implementations that allow for quick and easy testing. 
However, the licensing arrangements can be foggy
, and there is a wide variance with respect to the 
quality of implementation and document
ation. 
The 
IAD could take a role in helping to harvest these 
implementations with an eye toward persistence and reliability, and in leveraging open
-source 
environments such as Python that offer useful ways to bundle together data, access methods
, and 
expla
natory text.
 Tools for Security Policy
 IAD
™s work on 
the creation of tools for security policy and 
the 
representation of these tools in a 
form that permits agencies to simplify their password definition rules
 represents a
 very promising
 opportunity
. Currently
, the rules are ambiguous
 and
 too complex for system users to comprehend, and 
this 
seems to be an obstacle to the application of appropriate security practices government
-wide
. The 
IAD tool to clarify password rules promise
s to reduce this kind of
 obstacle. A further development of this 
tool, with appropriate explanatory text, could become an industry resource for citizen
-facing government 
and institutional services, and for consumer
-facing commercial firms.
  Common Industry Format
-Plus
 The Common 
Industry Format (CIF) [ISO/IEC 25062:2006 Software Engineering
ŒSoftware 
Product Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)] for usability test reports has been successful. 
The CIF for summative usability test reports is now in use across industry for saf
ety
-related usability 
certification of 
electronic health record 
systems, for usability and accessibility testing and certification of 
voting systems, and for usability testing of biometric systems. 
However, there is the question 
of 
whether 
that tool 
needs 
to be updated. The CIF focuses on speed, accuracy, and satisfaction with how systems 
support human work. In the past decade, other important aspects of user experience have gained 
commercial importance, such as completeness (rather than only speed) of lear
ning, comprehension, and 
engagement (rather than only accuracy) in game
-playing. As design becomes more important in 
commercial
 and 
recreational applications and educational settings for both formal schooling and lifelong 
learning, factors such as 
psychoph
ysiological 
indicators of cognitive load, enjoyment
, and other hedonic 
qualities are becoming increasingly relevant. There is rich measurement literature for these topics, but the 

unique capabilities of 
the 
IAD
 and
 ITL are needed to transform research into
 a more complete metrology 
of user experience, as measured through the holistic testing of usability
 and user engagement
. Health Informatics
 The health informatics arena represents both an opportunity and a challenge. 
The 
Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) pro
gram is not 
yet 
quantitatively driven. This was attributed by
 the
 IAD to the 
circumstance that real data arrived late in the process, after a 
4-year 
procurement and 
Institutional Review 
Board (
IRB
) delay
. This is a mandated project, and if process indeed hinders its progress, 
ITL needs to 
address th
ose problems, in collaboration with 
NIST leadership
, perhaps at the level
 of the U.S. Congress
. If the delay 
continues, the credibility of NIST could suffer. 
 Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 12 Conclusions
 The technical programs in 
the 
IAD are in general well organized, well
 staffed, and appropriate to 
the mission of ITL 
and 
IAD. 
  It is important 
that 
IAD 
maintain its momentum and leadership in 
its 
many s
uccessful activities
 but also consider th
e new opportunities 
that have been
 described above. This will be important to ensure 
success in a rapidly changing science and technology landscape. 
  It is also important that t
he division management review programs 
to 
identify 
those 
that need 
additional 
methodology or rigor and 
those 
that 
face 
challenging adoption paths. 
Such critical review could 
lead to the identification of 
needed 
resources not found at the division level. 
  The EHR program
, for example, would benefit from a critical review.
 The addition of new 
emphases to the 
Text Retrieval Conference (
TREC
) Clinical Decision Support tracks
 would add value to 
the division
™s EHR work
. Developing health data sets that can be used by the health informatics 
community would link the 25
-year impact 
of TREC to increasingly important challenges in 
electronic 
health records
. PORTFOLIO OF SCIENTI
FIC EXPERTISE
 Accomplishments
 The 
IAD is a recognized leader in impactful standards activities and conferences. Evidence of 
recognition appears in many forms
, such as
 program committee selection
, conference leadership
, and 
awards. As one example, TREC methods and results have been applauded by the search industry 

(Google
™s chief economist
), been 
credited with a 5:1 economic return in an RTI International 
study
,1 and cited in a federal case
.2  The 
IAD personnel have deep expertise in creating metrics and best practices for many classes of 
information applications. They have the core competency for continuing their mission in the next 
generation of multimedia and mul
timodal technologies. It is impressive that 
the 
IAD has been able to 
attract and retain personnel
 who 
are among the best in the world
 in their fields
. The fairly recent creation 
of new programs in 
open data, big data, 
data science, privacy
, and video is no
teworthy and indicative of a 
broad intellectual base in
 the
 IAD. 
 Opportunities and Challenges
 There is an opportunity to 
enhance 
core capabilities in several areas where
 the
 IAD aspires to 
make a major contribution. The Data Science program 
affords 
an 
opportunity to develop expertise in big
 data, linked data, unintended relations, and data mining. In the Privacy program, there is the continuing 
challenge of deidentification and usable interface controls for privacy settings. In Public Safety, where 
ther
e is a great societal need and infusion of significant funding in the pipeline, current IAD staff will 
need to be augmented in terms of scope as well as agility in new scientific areas. 
 The IAD and the 
Statistical Engineering Division (
SED
) have recent, o
ngoing, and planned 
collaborations in the following data science projects: identifying face quality and factor measures for 
video using the point
-and
-shoot challenge (PaSC) video data, fingerprint database mining for 
performance assessment of non
-parametri
c likelihood ratios for expressing weight of evidence, statistical 
analysis methods for evaluating automated text translation systems, measuring the usability and security

 Taking advantage of all opportunities for collaboration between these divisions would be beneficial to 
both.
  Addressing
 outcome measures beyond 
the 
CIF
, discussed 
above, is
 a fundamental scientific 
opportunity. It is also a necessary evolution of the technical program if 
the 
IAD wants to be a player in 
topics such as educational effectiveness, game
-playing experience, social engagement in media, social 
networking statistics,
 and citizen engagement in government services. 
These represent a reasonable 
extrapolation of IAD activity, but the core expertise will need
 to be enhanced with respect to expertise 
and number of researchers
.  Conclusions and Recommendations
 The portfolio 
of scientific expertise is appropriate and impressive for the traditional areas that the 
IAD 
focuses on
, but core capabilities need to be enhanced in areas where the IAD aspires to make a
n important 
contribution
.  Recommendation: 
The I
nformation Access Div
ision
 should
 review the current and 
proposed portfolios and 
examine 
the adequacy
 of its core competencies for
 ambitious new 
programs like data science, health informatics
, and public safety.
  
 Supporting the standards process places 
resource and 
attention
-span demands on personnel
. One 
option to reduce the demands
 could be
 to turn over standards materials 
to ISO and other SDOs.
 However, 
this approach is sometimes associated with update cycles that are too long and possibly too onerous to 
meet the 
original intent of the standard
, and it entails risk to IAD credibility.
   Recommendation: The 
Information Access Division
 (IAD) 
should continually consider the 
pros and cons of turning over standards materials
Šfor example, the Common Industry 
Format (
CIF)
Što 
the 
International Organization for Standardization (
ISO
) and other 
standards development organizations (
SDOs
). If the ISO
-SDO channel remains the best or 
only approach, the IAD should consider how to plan proactively for updates as appropriate 

and should propose updates to the controlling SDO(s) whenever IAD efforts indicate that 
they are needed or desired by the 
user community.
 ADEQUACY OF FACILITI
ES, EQUIPMENT, AND H
UMAN RESOURCES
 Accomplishments
 There are notable examples of 
good 
infrastructure available for 
the 
IAD, such as the Biometric 
Research Lab
oratory
. Also impressive is a well
-cultivated mechanism to exp
anded reach and impact 
through off
-campus 
centers of excelle
nce such as the effort with the University of Maryland and the use 
of cross
-organizational virtual teams within ITL
 and across NIST
.  Opportunities and Challenges
 The IAD team plays a significant 
role as leaders
 and 
shepherds 
of 
their communities of expertise. 
To 
fulfill this role 
with timeliness and excellence, seamless interaction and agility are critical success 
factors. As such, operational latencies in IRB or travel approval processes can be f
irst
-order detriments.
 Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 14 Maximization of impact depends on continued cross
-division collaboration and resource 
allocations. In a 
strategy 
that was described
 by IAD during the review,
 there appeared to be a major focus 
in the first one or two years of a new b
usiness area, followed by a reliance on the momentum and eventual 
allocation
 of resources to the budget. This might be a process worthy of more attention. Ideally, practices 
would be formalized in a way that permits 
their 
reuse for subsequent cross
-divisio
n projects. 
 Conclusions and Recommendations
 The facilities, equipment
, and human resources are strong asset
s of the
 IAD. As areas such as 
health informatics 
gain importance
, there seems to be a tendency to make
 do with the core talent areas 
rather than hi
ring specialists (
trained biomedical informaticians and health data scientists
) permanently or 
even for shorter time
s. This 
practice 
needs to be reconsidered in the strategic planning of the 
division. 
A prime example of this need is the EHR team.
  Recommendation: 
The Information Access Division 
(IAD) 
should bolster the 
electronic 
health record
 team to ensure that this high
-profile work is well supported in terms of 
information technology
 rigor as well as domain expertise. IAD should add scientists o
r contractors with strong clinical experience, include all stakeholders (physicians, nurses, 
technicians, pharmacists, and patients) in its empirical investigations, and participate in 
medical informatics communities such the American Medical Informatics A
ssociation 
(AMIA) and the congressionally
 chartered Patient
-Centered Outcomes Research Institute 
(PCORI).
 Internally, the IAD should collaborate closely with the Text Retrieval Conference 
(TREC) team on medical tracks.
   Collaborative teamwork 
with scienti
sts and engineers inside and outside of IAD, 
including virtual 
teamwork and in
-person interactions, is of fundamental importance to the work of the IAD staff. 
  Recommendation: 
To maximize the mechanism of virtual teams and to foster contacts with 
other laboratories, 
IAD 
should 
give
 greater consideration to the formulation of clear 
policies 
and processes
 that support sabbaticals and appropriate travel. 
   It would be helpful to cr
eate an IT sandbox
, using computational resources not connected to the 
core NIST infrastructure,
 to leverage infrastructure in creative and flexible ways that a general
 information security
 policy might inhibit
. DISSEMINATION OF OUT
PUTS
 Accomplishments
 The
 IAD
 has played key roles in creating standards for almost 30 years. Examples cover a broad 
range, from usability test reporting to biometric information exchange. The CIF for software usability 
testing and reporting, which started in what is now 
the 
IAD, 
has become an ISO standard (SC7 (CIF) 
ISO/IEC 25062:2005). The standard for the exchange of fingerprint data, which also started in
 the
 IAD 
(when NIST was the National Bureau of Standards) as 
a Federal Bureau of Investigation (
FBI
)-funded 
project, has rema
ined an 
American National Standards Institute (
ANSI
) standard since 
it was 
first 
approved in 1986. This standard has been updated several times to the current version (ANSI/NIST
-ITL 
1-2011 Update 2013). 
It has been
 used internationally, in at least 50 coun
tries and by Interpol, for the 
exchange of biometric and forensic data in and among criminal justice systems, applicant screening 
systems, and border
-crossing applications.
 IAD has also worked with the Election Assistance 
Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 15 Commission to develop usability an
d accessibility standards for voting systems (Chapter 3 of the 
Voluntary Voting System Standards) as part of the NIST Voting Program.
 In further support of standards,
 the
 IAD has developed and made available 
software trackers of 
standard
 conformance that a
re also widely used. 
  The 
IAD 
has
 also
 developed
 broadly usable IT tools for parsing and displaying password policies.
 Opportunities and Challenges
 Web-based tools can be used to broaden participation in workshops and short conferences and to 
disseminate 
the results and proceedings. 
This has been done recently for the 
NIST 
conference 
ﬁImproving 
Biometric and Forensic Technology: The Future of Research Datasets.
ﬂ The culture of IAD
 seems to emphasize highlighting the successes 
of others. This is very 
conducive to building a community spirit, but it 
needs to 
coexist with better marketing of the fundamental 
value that IAD personnel 
contribute
. Conclusions and Recommendations
 The IAD value proposition with standards and conformance t
ool
 sets is outstanding and deserves 
continued nurturing and support. 
Its dissemination process would be enhanced by greater use of 
Internet
-based methods.
  Recommendation: 
The 
Information Access Division
 should 
apply 
more 
Internet

 INTRODUCTION
 As observed in 
a National Research Council 
report
,1 the Statistical Engineering Division (SED)
 has nearly a 70
-year history of 
  Consistent and fundamental contributions to the central mission of NIST through the development 
and application of statistical methodology for metrology. This methodology supports
 the basic 
NIST activities of producing measurements and quantifying their associated uncertainties– The 
SED advances its mission of supporting research in measurement science, technology, and the 
production of standard reference materials (SRMs), through 
numerous scientific collaborations 
within NIST and externally. The SED conducts statistical research and provides important training 
and educational activities within and beyond NIST. It serves as a unique national and international 
resource for the metrol
ogy and standards communities and more broadly in high profile contexts 
where an acknowledged impartial broker of data analysis and interpretation is needed.
 ASSESSMENT OF TECHNI
CAL PROGRAMS
 Accomplishments
 The SED is well
-aligned and effective in its supp
ort of the main NIST missions.
 It currently 
conducts
 a wide variety of technical efforts, 
including
 classical statistical metrology projects such as mass 
calibration weighing designs, testing standards for cardiac leads, and 
laboratory
 experimentation for 
nanotoxicology. Other work supports national and international best statistical practices in metrology and 
the development of new methods of measurement and uncertainty quantification for important specialized 
technical applications. Current examples cover
 a broad range of scientific projects, including greenhouse 
gas emissions, U
.S. extreme wind speeds, shape metrology, and quantitative imaging of materials, as well 
as several projects related to 
the current NIST 
priority
 in forensic science
, including
 ana
lysis for low
-template 
deoxyribonucleic acid (
DNA) traces, firearm
s and
 tool marks, and general modeling and 
inference 
for problems in forensic science
.  The 
SED technical efforts 
are
 technically challenging and
 are 
well
 executed. 
Methodology that is 
developed for and applied to these challenges is sound
 and of high quality, equivalent
 to that of the best 
U.S. national laboratories and best industrial research facilities. In light of the unique mission of
 NIST 
and the role played by
 the
 SED in
 NIST, th
e division is a one
-of-a-kind national resource.

 The SED continues to have a low profile in the national and international technical statistics 
community. 
Some existing projects with concrete internal or subject

bles could be 
developed further or studied methodologically on a deeper level, which could lead to their publication in 
the mainstream statistical literature and thereby give the SED greater visibility. 
 Conclusions and Recommendations
  SED could more full
y benefit from and contribute to current statistical research.
  Recommendation: 
The 
Statistical Engineering Division
 should 
take steps to raise 
its 
profile 
through technical publications in statistics venues and through educational efforts to 
improve the a
wareness of statistics educators of the vital role of measurement in data 
collection and the role of statistics in good measurement.

 The 
number 
of staff 
continue
s to be a primary concern for the SED. 
Sixty
-five
 percent
 of the 
technical staff
 (16 of 25)
 will be
come
 eligible for retirement in the next 5 years. 
Technical staffing on 
important projects and in vital 
areas is very thin (ofte
n only one
 person per project), making the 
organization quite brittle. 
Continued hiring is essential into the foreseeable future
, at least at the pace of 
the last 
4 years
, during which 
four 
permanent employees and 
one 
guest were hired.
 Conclusions and 
Recommendations
  Progress has been made on human resource issues since the 2011 review, but important 
challenges remain.
  Recommendation:
 In hiring permanent employees, the Statistical Engineering Division 
(SED) 
should focus attention on
 (1) ensuring corpo
rate memory of and expertise in the 
fundamental ongoing 
National Institute of Standards and Technology
 standard reference 
material (SRM), calibration, and the experimental design work that has always been part of 
the SED portfolio, and on developing new ca
pabilities in priority areas such as shape 
metrology and greenhouse gas monitoring, which seem to be particularly thinly staffed; (2) 
maintaining high overall technical competence; (3) improving staff diversity; and (4) 
balancing emphases on the noncore an
d core areas
Šfor example, while forensics is a 
current laboratory
-wide priority and SED is a key participant, when hiring for forensics the 
SED should address
 general expertise, so that other more thinly staffed critical areas are 
not neglected.
  Recommend
ation:
 The Statistical Engineering Division should invigorate its program of 
graduate student internships to include two to four Ph.D. students per summer, and it 
should begin to develop a much broader and stronger program of visiting faculty 
researchers.
 DISSEMINATION OF OUT

 Accomplishments
 The SED research programs are clearly driven by stakeholder needs. 
The division has responded 
effectively to government priorities 
such as those related to greenhouse gas emissions and forensic 
science
. Its publications are effective 
in the metrological literature and 
for stakeholders.
  Opportunities and Challenges
 Strong contributions to the statistical literature 
improve and maintain engagement with the 
statistical research community
 and
 will, over time, 
improve the
 methods being brought into SED work
. Such efforts come at the expense of time on other projects and 
therefore require division

Systems Division
 INTRODUCTION
 The Software
 and
 Systems Division (
SSD) has
 to 
respond with an adaptive, nimble strategy to 
congressional mandates imposed on NIST
. The 
division 
need
s to 
evaluate each mandate within the 
context of its mission and expertise, leveraging staff and expertise to continue purs
uing a mix of tactical 
and strategic initiatives. This includes recruitment and cultivation of staff with the requisite skills for 
those initiatives.
 The SSD 
is 
engaged in several high profile areas, notably in voting, health IT, and cyberphysical 
systems 
(CPS). Failure, even in part, in any one of these areas would have profound implications for 
the 
SSD, ITL, and NIST. In each case, it is crucial that
 the SSD, in collaboration with ITL and NIST 
management,
 delineate the risks and rewards within the context of an organizational strategy. By defining 
the stakeholders and success metrics (e.g., customer satisfaction, standard development, uptake and 
adoption), it can match competence and resources to the risks
 and rewards.
  In line with the charge to the panel provided by the NIST Director, the assessment of the SSD 
focused on 
the following criteria:
   The unique NIST mission and its relationship to the broader articulation of the NIST/ITL strategy
 (i.e., non
-duplicative of other academic, laboratory
, or industrial efforts
). Of these, standards 
development is the most impactful
Šfollowed by the advancement of practice for measurement, 
evaluation, and interoperation support
Šbecause
 small NIST groups can have extrao
rdinary 
influence by leveraging a
 unique
 body of competence, institutional knowledge, and outreach 
capability
.   The technical excellence of the project and its team.
 Concomitantly, projects 
need to 
draw on the 
core intellectual expertise and mission focus of 
the SSD
, with skills aligned with the mission, 
objectives
, and mandates. 
  The degree of community involvement,
 balancing leadership and impartial convening for 
standards development and community
 engagement.

 Accomplishments
 The computational science metrology effort focuses primarily on computational science and 
measurement issues related to analysis of biomedical microscopy data. Analysis of multiscale imaging
 data is an increasingly important component 
in many areas
, including biomedicine and material
s science. 
In this class of challenging applications, a very large number (10
9 or more) 
of 
objects need to be 
segmented and tracked over time. Characteriz
ing the 
agreement between segmentation and tracking 
algorithms is a crucial and challenging component of this effort
, as is the need to quickly integrate and 
stitch disjoint patches of image data. The computational metrology SSD group has done admirable work 
in at
tracting strong scientific collaborators in 
the 
stem cell therapy area and in collaborating with this 
group to generate both publicly distributed software and published scientific results.
  Opportunities and Challenges
  The quality of this work is extraord
inar
ily high,
 but the group would likely increase 
the 
impact by 
broadening focus to supporting a broader range of scientific driving problems. 
A broader set of 
microscopy
-based applications 
could be
 entertained
. In addition
, the group might consider metrol
ogy 
issues associated with 
the 
analysis of other types of imaging. 
The inherent strengths of 
the SSD 
might be 
best served by a sharper focus on metrology methodology issues and metrology
-related imaging 
standards.
 A common set of issues arise in 
the 
analys
is of multiscale imaging data in many diverse 
application areas
; the SSD 
could potentially play an important role 
by 
helping 
scientific groups realize 
that they face a common set of metrology and algorithmic challenges.
  Voting Security and Verification
 In the wake of the vote
-counting challenges faced in the 2000 Presidential election, the 
United 
States
 started to pay more attention to its voting processes and technologies. Achieving standards
-based 
practices is challenging, 
because
 elections in the United
 States are carried out by 
more than
 10,000 
entities, with wide variations in technical capability and in the number of registered voters per entity
.1 Few of these entities have the budget or skilled personnel to enable them to evaluate new technologies 
independently or to compare and contrast processes on their own.
  Accomplishments
 In response to multiple mandates, ITL has assumed an increasingly impo
rtant role in voting 
systems 
since 2002
. Voting security and verification is one of 
the 
SSD™s long
-term, priority projects. In 
response to legislative mandates, it has been sustained over many years, with a strong and steady track 
record despite considerab
le oscillations in available funding. 
SSD reported that s
tandards developed by 
the program are 
being 
wide
ly adopt
ed. Engagement with the large 
and diverse 
communities of 
stakeholders is extensive. 
The SSD team is responsive to the voting
-technology communi
ty.                                                        1 According to NIST data
, some Northeastern townships have as little as a few hundred voters, while Los 
Angeles Cou
nty has about 4.8 million voters supported in 10 languages.
 Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 22 Opportunities and Challenges
  Despite the depth 
and importance 
of 
ITL work on voting systems development and 
implementation
, the
 public profile 
of the SSD in this area 
is not high. Among academic institutions
, the 
California Institute of Technology (
Caltech
), the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (
MIT
), and 
Stanford
 University
 are better known for their work on voting. 
The SSD could do more
 in the 
development of effective and 
public
ly disseminated software test tools and methodologies.
 Challenges remain regarding the mechanisms through which confident assurance judgments can 
be made for particular voting devices. These include how device vendors can effectively support the 
process. 
This needs to 
extend beyond mainstream vulnerability sca
ns and penetration testing. These tests 
address primarily vulnerabilities already identified by the cybersecurity community and for which there is 
experience in established mainstream computing systems. In general, however, they do not provide 
positive ass
urances regarding either other exploitable flaws or reliability challenges unrelated to 
cybersecurity. Voting systems are a mission
-critical feature of 
the 
U.S.
 democratic process, and the 
thresholds for acceptance 
need to
 be high, even if this means compr
omising on added technical features. 
In particular, acceptance evaluation
 needs to 
be accomplished through techniques more invasive than the 
block
-box evaluations typically used 
to test 
system
-level penetration in business and consumer systems. 
  ITL 
is in
 the important position of facilitating the dialog between the vendor community, which 
seeks to protect its intellectual property, and voting officials, who seek to make confident judgments 
regarding the fitness of candidate voting devices. This process of
 balancing interests requires a high level 
of expertise as well as an engaged neutral stance and an ability to engage effectively with diverse 
stakeholders. The SSD voting team has these characteristics, and
, consequently, it has a nationally 
significant r
ole.
 There is nonetheless a fragility to th
e SSD
 voting team
, which consists of a small group of 
capable and dedicated individuals
. Although the team is augmented by
 staff from 
the Information Access 
Division, 
the 
Statistical Engineering Division
, and 
the 
Computer Security Division
, it
 was not apparent 
during 
the review 
which 
mechanism is used to recruit and develop the necessary bench strength.
 Cloud Standards
 Accomplishments
 SSD™s work on cloud computing standards has had 
a substantial 
impact on 
government and 
industry
, both within the 
United States
 and internationally.
 Indeed,
 SSD™s body of definitions related to 
the various kinds of cloud computing
Šits reference architecture
Šis now internationally accepted, and it 
has led to a voluntary, consens
us ISO standard.
 As an impartial and regular convener of cloud service 
providers and consumers, 
the SSD 
continues to provide a forum for technical interchange and 
a venue for 

development of an evolving series of standards and a
 reference architecture. Ref
lecting interest levels and 
SSD credibility, the working groups on architectures and services, metrics, security, and interoperability 
continue to attract hundreds of participants.
   This work on cloud computing is driven by the relatively high level of com
mitment and risk 
associated with cloud adoption decisions, both in industry and in government. Decisions associated with 

the adoption of cloud computing encompass choices regarding the structure and location of organizational 
data and the selection of comp
uting paradigms. The principal decisions are architectural, but there are 
also decisions related to sourcing, with options ranging from vendor clouds (such as from Amazon, 
Google, and Microsoft) to shared or dedicated organizational clouds. Many criteria i
nfluence decisions, 
and the engineering trade
-offs are complex
 and 
are conducted 
in a technological environment of 
both 
evolutionary and rapid 
change
.  Cloud computing is significant because it has emerged as the dominant pathway to scale in 
computing resources. Cloud architectures offer not just the ability to manifest scale but also, separately, 
Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 23 the ability to rapidly scale up (or down) in the face of c
hanging computational demands. 
While 
ﬁthe 
cloud
ﬂ can also be a potential pathway to enormous cost savings due to the ability to share resources and 
the 
balanc
ing of
 loads
, any sharing of resources creates the possibility of security and reliability issues
. Moreover, importantly, cloud computing is a pathway to flexibility and adaptability of data
-intensive
 and 
computationally
 intensive systems and capabilities. This flexibility is increasingly important for a wide 
range of corporate and agency mission syst
ems.
 Opportunities and Challenges
  In the federal government, cloud adoption is perceived as having b
oth high benefit and high risk.
 Identifying the decision criteria and navigating the trade
-offs
 that realize
 the benefits with acceptable risk
 requires a high level of technical understanding. 
The SSD 
is facilitating this process by working with 
industry to assist in the decision and adoption process
, identifying the full range of criteria and, 
importantly, collaborating to develop the necessary 
metrics and guidance. This is creating 
a benefit for a 
broad range of stakeholders.
  SSD expertise and activities in this space have helped shape U.S. government cloud adoption. 
With respect to U.S. federal cloud strategy, the NIST initiative is the only d
eep effort, and it has the 
potential to shape the decision space for cloud engagements across multiple federal agencies.
 Software Assurance
 Accomplishments
 Software assurance is one of the most critical challenges for software
-reliant systems of all kinds.
 It is key 
for cybersecurity
 defense, safety
-critical systems, infrastructural systems, national security 
systems, 
and mainstream
 personal consumer systems. Software assurance failures are unfortunately 
ubiquitous, even in the most heavily evaluated system
s. The SSD software assurance project has done an excellent job of building useful data
 sets that can 
benefit producers of software tools and in raising awareness about the existence of these data
 sets. This 
includes databases of common software risks and 
security vulnerabilities
 and of test cases
.   The SSD software assurance project focuses specifically on tools for static software analysis. 
There are many other critical aspects of assurance practice, with broad
-scope models such as 
the 
Microsoft Security
 Development Lifecycle
 and the Building Security in Maturity Model evaluation 
framework. These provide frameworks through which a wide range of specific practices can be integrated 
into an overall process of development, evaluation, and modernization, with
 process models ranging from 
traditional linear and V models to DevOps and small
-team
-agile
 models
. Choices that influence the 
potential to achieve reliable assurance judgments 
include 
selection of programming languages, tools, and 

models for requirements
, and design to
 testing approaches, inspection, analysis, and runtime monitoring 
and logging.
   The SSD software assurance activity focuses primarily on static software analysis. This analysis 
operates at the level of code, usually source code
, but there ar
e also analyses directed at object code. 
Analyses of this kind can address many different categories of defects
, and 
their success can range
 wide
ly.
 For each particular quality attribute (i.e., category of defects) covered, diverse success measures 
are app
licable, including rates (and nature) of false positives and false negatives, scalability with respect 
to performance of the analysis, and composability with respect to software components.
 Review of Three Divisions of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology: Fiscal Year 2015Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. 24 Opportunities and Challenges
   The software assurance effort at 
the SSD 
builds on the C
ommon Weakness Enumeration
 and 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures resources from 
the 
MITRE
 Corporation
, which are inventories of 
specific kinds of software weaknesses and instances of vulnerabilities. The 
SSD 
effort takes on the 
challenge of linking these inventories with influences on development and evaluation practice. 
  Given its scope, the 
SSD 
effort is at a high level of quality and responsiveness to its stakeholder 
community. The effort is known among ve
ndors and many adopters as well. The scope is appropriate and 
important, since the evaluation frameworks, arguably, are prompting more efficient competition and more 
rapid innovation. There are questions, however, from the portfolio perspective. 
  For exam
ple, many of the other projects in ITL include the development of tests for conformance 
to the
 various standard representations and protocols to support interoperation. Most of these tests are 
black box
Šthat is, 
predicated on the tested components being op
aque to the test managers. However, this 
technique is only effective when certain engineering constraints are respected in the development of the 

black
 box component; without this, the results may not be sufficiently predictive. These constraints relate 
to determinism at all levels of design and implementation and to use of physical devices.
  More could be done 
by the SSD 
in the devel
opment of effective and public
ly disseminated 
software test tools and methodologies
Šfor example,
 for conformance and interope
rability testing. 
The
 SSD 
could take a leading role in the development 
of 
software test tools
. Software Forensics
 Accomplishments
 The 
SSD has several projects related to computer forensics. This is an increasingly important 
feature of processes associated 
with criminal investigations and legal discovery as well as the preservation 

and archiving of electronic documents, data, and other computational assets. Complicating the process is 
the vast amount of data space dedicated to systems and applications softwa
re as well as associated 
common data assets. Also complicating the process is uncertainty regarding the actions to take, for 
example, in a law enforcement situation in the immediate moments when computers and mobile devices 
are seized and potentially volat
ile data 
needs to 
be preserved.
  A complete
 review of the software forensics area
 could not be conducted
, because
 much of this 
work is shared with the Cybersecurity Division
 of ITL
, which fell outside the scope of the present review.
 However, it was noted that the 
SSD has developed a very large corpus of signatures for applications and 
standard files. The SSD team is also developing both guidance and test capabilities to facilitate the 
evaluation of various kinds of forensic tools and 
capabilities
. Opportunities and Challenges
  Matches with items in th
e corpus 
of signatures for applications and standard files 
would enable 
the forensic process to focus rapidly on data specific to 
a situation, avoiding 
the
 manual process of sifting 
out co
mmon software and data files. The scale of the 
SSD 
corpus is growing rapidly
. However,
 there are 
significant technical challenges 
to 
be faced, including the proliferation of versions of frequently released 
software, the addition of shape shifting and other
 resiliency features that make fingerprinting more 
difficult, and the increasing role of cloud and other remote resources in hosting user data. 
  This latter challenge could drive 
the
 need for a significant paradigm shift from the current 
approach based on
 signature matching. This is analogous to the challenge faced in the fingerprinting of 
malware specimens, many of which no longer have a re
adily identifiable static form.

the 
Internet of Things
 The activities in 
the 
Internet of T
hings (IoT) and Cyberphysical Systems (CPS) 
are
 a welcome 
addition to the
 SSD portfolio
, because
 these domains are important from 
a technological and industrial 
point of view. These domains are going to be critical to the future of services and products. T
he approach 
taken by 
the SSD 
is technically sound and addresses some of the important issues in the area. The 
industrial relevance of the 
IoT
 in the United States is high, as demonstrated by the enormous industrial 
interest that has resulted in a cacophony
 of semistandards proposed by many industrial consortia. The 
consortia 
were
 formed to define communication standards
, but there is still no clear winner. In this 
environment, NIST can 
function as a neutral player 
to mediate among different camps. 
 Opportun
ities and Challenges
 On the technical side, 
the 
SSD has
 demonstrated leadership in establishing the smart city grand 
challenge as well as the 
CPS
 Public Working Group (CPS PWG
), provid
ing
 a forum 
for
 discuss
ing
 the 
CPS reference architecture, security, interoperability
, and testing. In this activity, 
the SSD 
has gained 
recognition and engagement in the scientific community
. It remains to be seen whether 
the 
division 
can 
reach the same level of visibility and eng
agement in the industrial community. 
It would be beneficial for 
SSD to
 engage the community in leveraging the test infrastructure that they are developing. In this 
respect, the technical capability of the precision timing researchers is high
; they showed
 excellent 
knowledge of the field and overall competence spanning many areas. 
 Electronic Health Records
 Multiple major drivers for change face the nation as 
it 
seek
s to create a sustainable

and
 healthcare delivery system. 
The nation is
 moving to
 an accountable
 care
 organization structural 
model for the health and care of defined populations
, with payment based on documented value relating 
to outcomes, services
, and relevant quality and safety. To achieve the desired outcomes, patients a
nd communities 
need to 
become active partners
, working 
with relevant interprofessional teams relating to 
health and care. 
The nation is
 also moving toward care based on precision medicine
, where care is 
increasingly based on individual characteristics at the molecular as well as 
the 
societal level
 (e.g.
, genomics and epigenetics
). With the recent federal major investment in 
electronic 
health 
records(
EHRs
) and data exchanges, there is an expe
ctation 
that 
the 
big da
ta health information infrastructure necessary 
for an information and communications ecosystem needed to achieve major progress
 will be created
.   With respect to the big data ecosystem, EHRs and related public health data generators
 need to be 
able to create health records from a common data strategy through the nation

a mandated role as part of the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act (ARRA) 
Health
 Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (
HITECH) legislation. 
Specifically, the
 role
 relate
s to supporting the ONC with EHRs and 
meaningful u
se. The current staff at 
the SSD is
 comprised of capable computer scientists and information technologists
, but includes
 no biomedical/health informaticians.
 Opportunities and Challenges
  It is not clear that
 the
 ONC has a comprehensive strateg
y that allocates the tasks needed for the 
nation to achieve interoperable EHRs and EHR systems.
 Therefore, 
the SSD
 is faced with making
 a strategic choice. One choice is to limit its EHR
-related work so that it focuses
, essentially
, only on 
relevant but na
rrow technology issues and does not represent itself as working on 
meaningful use
 or 
interoperability components, which intrinsically involve clinical information relating to decision
 making 
and clinical care. Alternatively,
 the SSD 
could work through a we
ll-defined and circumscribed agenda 
coordinated with the other relevant key government agencies, including ONC, 
the National Library of 
Medicin
e (NLM
), the National Institutes of Health (
NIH
), the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality (
AHRQ
), and the 
Food and Drug Administration (
FDA
). Also, 
the SSD 
could consider 
approaching NLM for collaboration and assistance. 
  Recommendation: 
The
 Software and Systems Division
 not only 
should participate 
in 
the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/I
nternational Electrotechnical
 Commission (IEC)
 joint technical committee working group on the 
Internet of Things
 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG10)
 and 
the 
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 
project on the
 Standard for an Architectural Framework fo
r the Internet of Things
 (P2413)
, but also 
should 
reach out to the industrial consortia such as the Industrial Internet 

Consortium and the Open Interconnect Consortium. 
  Recommendation: 
The 
Software and Systems Division
 should make open to the scientific 
and industrial communities the 
framework
 that the
 SSD put together for the Smart Grid
, as 
well as 
tools and techniques developed in university projects such as 
PRET 
(Precision 
Timed) machines project at the University of California, 
Berkeley
.  
Recommendation: The 
Software and Systems Division
 should look into growing 
its
 approach to timing in connection with Internet of Things applications by considering 
protocols 
that are 
robust to clock drift.
  Recommendation: 
For 
the electronic health record 
(HER)
 the 
Software and Systems 
Division
 (SSD) 
should define a 
clear direction
 that 
allow
s it to either focus on limited 
objectives or add staff of the appropriate types to meet larger expectations.
 Because 
focusing on meaningful use of EHRs is intrinsicall
y clinical in nature
, the SSD should 
consider 
adding clinical
 informaticians 
to its staff.

ES, EQUIPMENT, AND H
UMAN RESOURCES
 Accomplishments
 The SSD project suite spans a wide range
 that includes 
improving voting in national and local 
elections
; electronic medical records
; and the 
use of standards in forensics
, cybersecurity
, and software 
assurance.
 Overall, the technical work seems excellent
 and is
 conducted by capable staff. There have been 
substantial accomplishments, especially give
n the 
limited 
available resources and legislative mandates. In 
addition, based on the projects presented for review, there seems to be an appropriate balance of long
-term, short
-term
, and opportunistic projects. 
The 
SSD uses a mix of formal and informal ma
nagement 
processes to maintain that balance. 
  Projects where
 the
 SSD engages in standards activities have the most impact, followed by 
activities focusing on advancing measurement and evaluation capability. These activities leverage a body 

of expertise an
d institutional experience at the SSD
, magnifying its leverage. Given the limited resources 
of 
the SSD
, this is particularly important.
 Opportunities and Challenges
  Key SSD personnel seem 
to have
 opportunities to pursue new projects within the limited 
res
ource
s available to 
them
. Continued pressure to take on additional projects could 
necessitate 
more 
formal prioritization criteria and processes and 
could also 
hinder the ongoing professional development of 
technical staff, which is essential
, given the pac
e of technological advances.
  Because many staff members are committed to multiple projects and most existing projects are 
expected 
to continue for extended periods
, the
 SSD is at or near its capacity to undertake new projects. 
This
 fragility of human reso
urces creates project and organizational risk. With limited bench strength, the 
loss of even one or two individuals could endanger or derail several extant projects.
 The 
SSD seems
 to a
ttract requests from other
 parts of NIST
 that are less capable in computer 
science
. The SSD needs to determine whether 
this is something NIST management wants to encourage, 
and whether the SSD 
mission 
needs to be made 
more explicit, 
so that 
staffing allocations match
 the 
mission
. Alternatively, 
these engagements 
could be limited 
to maximize human resource flexibility for 
core projects. The non
-personnel resources (e.g., computing infrastructure and laboratory space) seem 
adequate but limited. There is little room for
 contraction 
of work 
without a
dversely affecting current 
programs, and 
such contraction could
 limit uptake of new projects
, as 
do personnel 
constraints. 
Conversely
, there are important opportunities for 
the 
SSD to leverage technical expertise elsewhere in 
ITL, particularly in the area 
of cybersecurity. With many SSD activities establishing patterns for future 
technical development, it is important that they be fully informed regarding considerations of security, as 
well as functionality, performance, and other quality attributes. This a
pplies, 
for example,
 to 
work related 
to voting, health data management, and 
CPS
.  The 
SSD lacks the resources or internal expertise to devote additional effort to outreach and 
dissemination. Consequently, its work is well regarded within the narrow communi
ties with 
which 
the 
SSD directly interacts, but the work is not known in larger contexts. This outreach 
would be 
best 
undertaken 
with support from 
higher 
organizational 
level
s (e.g., ITL or NIST 
as a whole
) if the 
organization were to adopt explicit outrea
ch goals in a manner similar to other research
-oriented 
organizations (e.g., NSF and
 NIH). The work on voting, for example, illustrates the importance of this 
broader outreach, 
because 
it touches on technical as well as social issues.
  With respect to its 
work on 
electronic health records
, coordinated with the 
work of 
other relevant 
key government agencies,
 the SSD could 
augment its staff appropriately to address the challenges, with 
assured funding and explicit roles for multiple years. 
This 
would also enable 
better
 consistency across 
those involved in establishing standards for data representation and interoperability.

 could consider approaching NLM for collaboration and assistance. It is possible that 
NLM could provide one or more cl
inical informaticians who could work on loan to the 
SSD 
effort. In 
addition,
 the SSD
 might consider establishing Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) positions to attract 
academic medical center
-based clinical informaticians to 
the SSD
. The absence of in
-house clinical 
expertise is problematic, 
because 
the 
SSD 
work will almost certainly be conceived as being broader and 
demand 
greater expertise than the current skill set of 
SSD personnel
. Adding some clinical informatics 
personnel would make great sense
. The clinical informatician
s need not be physician
s, because clinical
 informatics is an interdisciplinary field
; a well
-trained nurse informatician may be equally effective. The 
extramural 
visibility and importance of the HITECH
 electronic health record
 init
iative is such that it 
should
 only
 fail on sound merits rather than from lack of internal collaboration and coordination across 
agencies having the relevant expertise.
 DISSEMINATION OF OUT
PUTS
  The SSD is a gem
 in the crown of the nation
™s research laborat
ories, yet today too few Americans 
know about 
its 
activities and accomplishments despite their being able to enjoy the benefits 
of 
SSD™s work.
 A more public face for 
the SSD 
would serve it well. That public face should focus on 
SSD™s achievements and their
 meaning. This
 visibility would 
be a vehicle for communicating the benefits of 
SSD™s activities 
and
 as a mechanism 
for shaping
 public opinion 
about 
the SSD
™s priorities and resource 
needs.
 Other 
federal agencies and laboratories have highly visible communication and social media 
outreach strategies. For example, NIH has its 
foundation;
2 NLM
 has its Friends of the Library
,3 with a 
publication for doctor
™s offices called MedLine Plus; and the Center
s for Disease Control
 and Prevention
 has a 
foundation.
4 NSF
 and the Department of Energy have similar outreach and communication 
programs to highlight the broad impact of their work on society.
 Given 
SSD™s resources, this outreach 
could 
take place 
in collab
oration with 
ITL 
and
 NIST as a 
whole. Individual divisions are too small
, and the cross
-couplings of projects are too great
, for outreach 
engagement at the division level to be effective. Active communication is an element of strategy
; it shapes the enviro
nment in which projects are pursued and resources are allocate
