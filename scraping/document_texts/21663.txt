Abbreviated Version of a Classified Report
 
At the reque
st of the 
Chief of Naval Operations, 
the National Research Council 
(NRC) 
appointed an expert committee to 
review 
the 
U.S. Nav
y

 
cyber defense 
capabilities.  
T
he D
epartment 
of the Navy 
has 
determine
d
 
that the 
final 
report prepared 
by the committee is classified in its entirety under Executive Order 13526 and therefore 
cannot be made available to the public.  
This abbreviated report
 
provides background 
information on the 
full 
report and the committee that prepared it.
 
Copies of the report 
will be made
 
available to authorized individuals in the 

 
(

).
  
Othe
r requests for the report 
should be submitted to the Department of the Navy.
 
The project that is the subject of this report was approved by the Governing Board of 
the NRC, whose members are drawn from the councils of the National Academy of 
Sciences, the N
ational Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine.  The 
members of the committee responsible for the report were chosen for their special 
competences and with regard for appropriate balance.
  
The
 
study was supported by a 
contracting arrangement

BACKGROUND
 
The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), conducted internally by the 
Department of Defense (D
o
D) to identify military capabilities that wou
ld contribute to 
fulfilling U.S. national security needs, stated the following:
 

The United States has come to depend on cyberspace to communicate in new ways, 
to make and store wealth, to deliver essential services, and to perform national 
security functi
ons. 
 
The importance of cyberspace to the American way of life 

 
and to 


 
makes cyberspace an attractive target for those seeking to 
challenge our security and economic order.  Cyberspace will continue to feature 
increasing opportunities bu
t also constant conflict and competition 

 
with 
vulnerabilities continually being created with changes in hardware, software, 
network configurations, and patterns of human use. 
 
Cyber threats come from a 
diverse range of countries, organizations, and indiv
iduals whose activities are posing 
increasingly significant risks to U.S. nati
onal interests.  
Some threats seek to 

-
 
and long
-
term military effectiveness by gaining 
unauthorized access to Department of Defense and industry ne
tworks and 
infrastructure on a routine basis. 
 
Further, potential adversaries are actively probing 
critical infrastructure throughout the United States and in partner countries, which 
could inflict significant damage to the global economy and create or exa
cerbate 
instability in the security environment.

The QDR builds
 
on 
the 
former 
Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) strategic guidance 
provided to 
DoD 
in 2012 
which n
oted
 
among the primary missions of the U.S. armed 
forces was the ability to operate effectively in cyberspace and space.  Specifically,

In order to conduct operations successfully and defend its capabilities against all 
warfighting domains, many have warned DoD of the severity of the cyber threat and 
called for greater attention to defending against potential cyber attacks.  
For several 
ye
ars, m
any within and outside DoD have called for even greater attention 
to 
addressing 
threats to cyberspace.  
F
or example, a 2013 
Defense Science Board (DSB) 
task force 
examined the resiliency of DoD systems to cyber attack and 
stated the following upfront
 
in its report:
 

systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and well
-
resourced opponent 
utilizing cyber capabilities in combination with all of their military and 
intelligence 
capabilities (a "full spectrum" adversary).  While this is also true for others (e.g.
,
 
Allies, rivals, and public/private networks), this Task Force strongly believes the DoD 
needs to take the lead and build an effective response to measurably
 
increase 
confidence in the IT systems we depend on (public and private) and at the same time 
decrease a would
-
be attacker's confidence in the effectiveness of their capabilities to 
compromise DoD systems.  We have recommended an approach to do so, and we
