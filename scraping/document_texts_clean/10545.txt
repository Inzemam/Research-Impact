their broad interest in the health ofamericaõs research enterprise, the national academieslaunched a study in early 2000 on the implications ofinformation technology for the future of the nationõsresearch universityña social institution of great importance toour economic strength, national security, and quality of life.the premise of this study was a simple one. although therapid evolution of digital technology will present numerouschallenges and opportunities to the research university, there isa sense that many of the most significant issues are not wellunderstood by academic administrators, faculty, and those whosupport or depend on the institutionõs activities.the studyñorganized under the policy and global affairsdivision of the national research council, and undertaken during the past two yearsñhad two major objectives:¥to identify those information technologies likely to evolvein the near term (a decade or less) that could ultimately havemajor impact on the research university.¥to examine the possible implications of these technologiesfor the research universityñits activities (teaching, research,service, outreach) and its organization, management, andfinancingñand the impacts on the broader highereducationenterprise.in addressing the second point, the panel examined thosefunctions, values, and characteristics of the research universitymost likely to change as well as those most important to preserve.in pursuit of these ends, a panel was formed that consistedof leaders drawn from industry, higher education, and foundations with expertise in the areas of information technology, thepreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution2research university, and public policy. the study processincluded several meetings and site visits, a major workshop,and communication by conference call and email (seeappendixes a and b).drawing on its own informationgathering activities, as wellas on the growing literature that deals with higher educationand information technology, the panel reached several conclusions that should help guide the future efforts of the researchuniversity and its stakeholders:1.the extraordinary pace of informationtechnology evolution is likely not only to continue for the next several decadesbut could well accelerate. it will erode, and in some casesobliterate, higher educationõs usual constraints of space andtime. institutional barriers will be reshaped and possibly transformed.2.the impact of information technology on the researchuniversity will likely be profound, rapid, and discontinuousñjust as it has been and will continue to be for our other socialinstitutions (e.g., corporations and governments) and theeconomy.3.digital technology will not only transform the intellectualactivities of the research university but will also change how theuniversity is organized, financed, and governed. the technologycould drive a convergence of higher education with itintensivesectors such as publishing, telecommunications, and entertainment, creating a global òknowledge and learningó industry.4.procrastination and inaction are dangerous courses forcolleges and universities during a time of rapid technologicalchange, although institutions will also need to avoid makinghasty responses to current trends. just as in earlier periods ofchange, the university will have to adapt itself to a radicallychanging world while protecting its most important values andtraditions, such as academic freedom, a rational spirit of inquiry,and liberal learning.5.although we are confident that information technologywill continue its rapid evolution for the foreseeable future andmay ultimately have profound impacts on human behavior andsocial institutions such as the research university, it is far moredifficult to predict these impacts with any precision. nevertheless, higher education must develop mechanisms to at leastpreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.executive summary3sense the potential changes and to aid in the understanding ofwhere the technology may drive it.6.it is therefore important that university strategies include:the development of sufficient inhouse expertise among facultyand staff to track technological trends and assess various coursesof action; the opportunity for experimentation; and the ability toform alliances with other academic institutions as well as withforprofit and governmental organizations.although the studyõs discussions and workshops exploreda number of policy issuesñsuch as the changing environmentsfor funding and intellectualproperty protectionñthat affect howthe research university can best utilize information technology,the panel concluded that to offer recommendations for specificpolicy changes would be premature. digital technology is evolving so rapidly that an overly prescriptive set of conclusions andrecommendations would be in danger of becoming irrelevantsoon after the reportõs publication.given that the foreseeable future will be marked by greatuncertainty, the panel instead recommends that the researchuniversity and its stakeholders develop a continuing dialogue,with national and grassroots components, to help research institutions and the broader highereducation enterprise understandthe advances in information technology and address theirpotential impacts. the dialogue should involve monitoringspecific technological changes and the resulting scholarly, educational, and social shifts; identifying crucial issues, challenges,and opportunities; stimulating awareness on the campuses; andidentifying action items for further study.briefly put, the dialogue should grapple with the manyaspects of the question: how will the research university defineand fulfill its missions in a twentyfirst century characterized byubiquitous and rapidly evolving digital technology?the ultimate goal is to expand and strengthen the researchuniversityõs intellectual resources and institutional infrastructure not only to manage the anticipated transformation but tolead it. this will require a commonality of understanding amongmembers of the university community (administrators, faculty,students), between disciplines, and between the university andits key external constituents (governing bodies, state governments, federal agencies, and foundations). such a dialogue canpreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution4help the research university not only to survive the coming eraof rapid change as a vital american institution but to fulfill itstraditional roles of education, research, and service more effectively and in as yet undreamedof ways.preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.introduction5ur society is now being reshaped by rapid advancesin information technologiesñcomputers, telecommunications networks, and other digital systemsñthathave vastly increased our capacity to know, achieve,and collaborate (attali, 1992; brown, 2000; deming and metcalfe,1997; kurzweil, 1999). these technologies allow us to transmitinformation quickly and widely, linking distant places anddiverse areas of endeavor in productive new ways, and to createcommunities that just a decade ago were unimaginable.of course, our society has been through other periods ofdramatic change before, driven by such innovations as the steamengine, railroad, telephone, and automobile. but never beforehave we experienced technologies that are evolving so rapidly(increasing in power by a hundredfold every decade), alteringthe constraints of space and time, and reshaping the way wecommunicate, learn, and think.the rapid evolution of digital technologies is creating notonly new opportunities for our society but challenges to it aswell,1 and institutions of every stripe are grappling to respondby adapting their strategies and activities. corporations andgovernments are reorganizing to enhance productivity, improvequality, and control costs. entire industries have been restructured to better align themselves with the realities of the digitalage. it is no great exaggeration to say that information technology is fundamentally changing the relationship betweenpeople and knowledge.yet ironically, at the most knowledgebased entities of allñour colleges and universitiesñthe pace of transformation hasbeen relatively modest in key areas. although research has inmany ways been transformed by information technology, and itpreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution6is increasingly used for student and faculty communications,other highereducation functions have remained more or lessunchanged. teaching, for example, largely continues to follow aclassroomcentered, seatbased paradigm.nevertheless, some major technologyaided teaching experiments are beginning to emerge, and several factors suggest thatdigital technologies may eventually drive significant changethroughout academia (newman and scurry, 2000; hanna, 2000;noble, 2001). because these technologies are expanding by ordersof magnitude our ability to create, transfer, and apply information, they will have a profound impact on how universitiesdefine and fulfill their missions. in particular, the ability ofinformation technology to facilitate new forms of human interaction may allow the transformation of universities toward agreater focus on learning.2american academia has undergone significant change before,beginning with the establishment of secular education duringthe 18th century (rudolph, 1991). another transformationresulted from the landgrant college act of 1862 (morrill act),which created institutions that served agriculture and industries;academia was no longer just for the wealthy but charged withproviding educational opportunities to the working class aswell. around 1900, the introduction of graduate education beganto expand the role of the university in training students forcareers both scholarly and professional. the middle of the twentieth century saw two important changes: the g. i. bill, whichprovided educational opportunities for millions of returningveterans; and the research partnership between the federalgovernment and universities, which stimulated the evolution ofthe research university. looking back, each of these changesseems natural. but at the time, each involved some reassessmentboth of the structure and mission of the university (wulf, 1995).already, higher education has experienced significanttechnologybased change, particularly in research,3 even thoughit presently lags other sectors in some respects. and we expectthat the new technology will eventually also have a profoundimpact on one of the universityõs primary activitiesñteachingñby freeing the classroom from its physical and temporal boundsand by providing students with access to original sourcematerials (gilbert, 1995). the situations that students willencounter as citizens and professionals can increasingly bepreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.introduction7simulated and modeled for teaching and learning, and newlearning communities driven by information technology willallow universities to better teach students how to be criticalanalyzers and consumers of information.the information society has greatly expanded the need foruniversitylevel education; lifelong learning is not only a private good for those who pursue it but also a social good in termsof our nationõs ability to maintain a vibrant democracy andsupport a competitive workforce.but while information technology has the capacity to enhanceand enrich teaching and scholarship, it also appears to posecertain threats to our colleges and universities (duderstadt,2000a; katz, 1999) in their current manifestations. we can nowuse powerful computers and networks to deliver educationalservices to anyoneñany place, any time. technology can createan open learning environment in which the student, no longercompelled to travel to a particular location in order to participate in a pedagogical process involving tightly integrated studiesbased mostly on lectures or seminars by local experts, is evolvinginto an active and demanding consumer of educational services.4similarly, facultyõs scholarly communities are shifting fromphysical campuses to virtual ones, globally distributed incyberspace. and technological innovations are stimulating thegrowth of powerful markets for educational services and theemergence of new forprofit competitors, which could also helpreshape the highereducation enterprise (goldstein, 2000; shea,2001).technological change also has the potential for transforming how the research university accomplishes its social mission.in an increasingly global culture linked together by technology,with no single cultural context to provide a òfilter,ó the role oftraditional disciplinary canons is changing.it is clear that the digital age poses many questions foracademia. for example, what will it mean to be òeducatedó inthe twentyfirst century? how will academic research be organized and financed? as the constraints of time and space arerelaxed by information technology, how will the role of theuniversityõs physical campus change?in the near term it seems likely that the campus, a geographically concentrated community of scholars and a center ofculture, will continue to play a central role, though the currentpreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution8manifestations of higher education may shift. for example,students may choose to distribute their college experience amongresidential campuses, commuter colleges, and online (virtual)universities. they may also assume more responsibility for, andcontrol over, their education.5 the scholarly activities of facultywill more frequently involve technology to access distantresources and enhance interaction with colleagues around theworld. the boundaries between the university and broadersociety may blur, just as its many roles will become ever morecomplex and intertwined with those of other components of theknowledge and learning enterprise (brown and duguid, 1996).thus we must take care not simply to extrapolate the pastbut instead to examine the full range of options for the future,even though their precise impacts on society and its institutionswill be difficult to predict. in any case, we must be ready fordisruption. just as these technologies have driven rapid, significant, and frequently discontinuous and unforeseen change inother sectors of our society, so too will they present universitydecision makers not only with exciting prospects but a decidedlybumpy ride.context for the studygiven their mandate from congress to advise the federalgovernment on scientific and technological matters, thepresidents of the national academies (national academy ofsciences, national academy of engineering, and institute ofmedicine) acted on the above concerns. they launched a projectin early 2000, through the national research council (nrc), tobetter understand the implications of information technologyfor the research university. this institution is a key element ofthe national research enterprise, a prime mover of the economy,and a critical source of scientists and engineers. its wide rangeof academic functions also makes it an important model foranalysis, with broad applicability elsewhere in the universitycommunity.primary support for the national academies project wasprovided by the national research council, with additionalsupport from the w.k. kellogg foundation, the national sciencefoundation, and the woodrow wilson fellowship foundation.¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences.

these technologiesfor the research universityñits activities (teaching, research,service, outreach) and its organization, management, andfinancingñand the impacts on the broader highereducationenterprise.box 11: what is a research university?the carnegie foundation, in its 1994 classification system of colleges anduniversities, defined a research university as follows:¥offers a full range of baccalaureate programs.¥is committed to graduate education through the doctorate.¥gives high priority to research.¥awards 50 or more doctoral degrees a year.¥receives at least $15.5 million a year in federal support.in its updated 2000 classification, redefined solely on the basis of degreesawarded, the carnegie foundation listed 261 doctoral/research universities.as of fall 1998, these institutions enrolled over 4.24 million students (about28% of total enrollment nationwide). these universities were also the recipientsof over $10 billion in federal research funding in fy 1998 (about 88% of allfederal research funding for highereducation institutions).source: compiled by nrc staff from carnegie foundation, 2001; duderstadt,1999; kushner, 2001; chronicle of higher

revolution10in addressing the second point, the panel examined thosefunctions, values, and characteristics of the research universitymost likely to change as well as those most important to preserve.in pursuit of these ends, a panel was formed consisting ofleaders from industry, higher education, and foundations withexpertise in the areas of information technology, the researchuniversity, and public policy. since first convening in february2000, the steering committee has held a number of meetingsñincluding site visits to major technologydevelopment centerssuch as lucent (bell) laboratories and ibm research laboratoriesñto identify and discuss trends, issues, and options. themajor themes addressed by these activities were:¥ the pace of evolution of information technology.¥ the ubiquitous character of the internet.¥ the relaxation of the conventional constraints of space,time, and institution.¥ the pervasive character of information technology (thepotential for nearuniversal access to information, education,and research).¥ the changing ways in which we handle digital data, information, and knowledge.¥ the growing importance of intellectual capital relative tophysical or financial capital.in january 2001 a twoday workshop was held at the nationalacademiesñwith the invited participation of about 80 leadersfrom higher education, industry, and governmentñto explorepossible strategies for the research university and its variousstakeholders and to provide input on possible followupinitiatives. the presentations and discussions of the workshopwere videotaped and broadcast on the research channel, andthey are currently being videostreamed from its web site(programs.researchchannel.com) to help stimulate public discussion. members of the panel also participated in a discussionof the project at the june 2001 meeting of the governmentuniversityindustry research roundtable.this report, finalized through a series of conference callsand email exchanges during the second half of 2001, discusseswhat the panel learned during the study process. chapter 2describes the likely nearfuture of information technology;preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.introduction11chapter 3 discusses the implications of this technology for theresearch university; and chapter 4 summarizes the panelõs findings and calls for a continued dialogue between the researchuniversity and its stakeholders on these issues.the panel has tried to maintain a clear and focused presentation of the issues. in a number of places, it makes assertionsbased on its collective judgment, while taking care to alert readersand appropriately qualify those assertions. where possible, thereport references the growing literature on information technology and education in order to complement the panelõsopinions. yet change is occurring so rapidly there is high riskthat any specific assertion made by individual experts or a panelsuch as this one may be proved wrong within a few years.indeed, a central theme of the report is that the researchuniversity must be prepared to cope with constant shifts andcontinued uncertainty regarding information technology andits implications.in addition, while this report focuses on the 261 u.s.doctoral/research universities, one of the inevitable consequences of the march of information technology is that theseuniversities will become much more interconnected with therest of higher education. therefore much of the discussion dealswith the broader academic context, of which the research university is but one component.however, in seeking to gain a broad view of the issuesfacing the research university and information technology, thepanel was unable (given the available time and resources) toexamine several issues in the depth it would have liked. therefore some important topics, such as the service mission of theuniversity, are discussed but briefly.finally, although its original charge was to provide specificconclusions and recommendations on a range of policy issuesñincluding some, such as the altered funding environment forthe research university and the changes to intellectualpropertyprotection wrought by the digital revolution that are spurringlegislative actions, roiling campuses, and finding their way tocourtñthe panel ultimately decided that specificity at this pointwould be inappropriate and premature. digital technology isevolving so rapidly that an overly prescriptive set of conclusions and recommendations would be in danger of becomingirrelevant soon after the reportõs publication. however, thepreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution12priorities for action that the panel identified are in areas thatinstitutions and the overall highereducation enterprise canthemselves consider and begin to address. and academia mightget some assistance in that regard. the digital revolution willundoubtedly create barriers and opportunities that permit newfederal and state approaches to provide significant leverage inhelping the research university anticipate and manage change.preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.technology futures13he role of digital technology in the evolving knowledge society is comparable to that of the railroadduring the industrial revolution (attali, 1992). withthe aid of informationtechnology òtracksóñhighspeed computer and telecommunications systemsñnow interconnecting so much of the world, reaching into the marketplace,government, and our homes and lives, we often learn aboutevents virtually as soon as they occur and we are able to processthe information in a myriad of increasingly useful ways.this extensive network is bringing peoples and culturestogether and creating new social dynamics in the process. it isleading to the formation of closely bonded, widely dispersedcommunities of people united by their interest in doing businessor in sharing experiences and intellectual pursuits. new formsof knowledge accumulation are developing, as are computerbased learning systems that open the way to innovative modesof instruction and learning (brown, 2000). and new models oflibraries are exploiting vast amounts of digital data in physicallydispersed computer systems that can be remotely accessed byusers over information networks (national research council,2000a).a major frontier over the next one or two decades is certainto be the òuser interfaceó for complex information systems.how can it become a more natural environment that transcendslimitations of keyboard, mouse, and screenñmoving toward animmersive environment in which attributes of human facetoface exchange can essentially be captured? ultimately, òvirtualenvironments,ó in which we respond to lifelike simulations thatare replete

national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution14for application include medicine as well as distance education(olsen, 2000; young, 2000b).information technology thus presents significant opportunities for those in the highereducation enterprise who seek newand better approaches to teaching and learning, research, andpublic service (national education association, 2000; carr,2000b; mendels, 1999). however, the effective use of knowledgein such forms may well require a rethinking of many currentassumptions about education in general and the researchuniversity in particular (hanna, 2000; wulf, 1995).this chapter is intended to provide an overview ofinformationtechnology advances that the panel expects to seeover the next decade. two caveats should be kept in mind. first,the focus of the chapter is on anticipated hardware advances.yet equivalent advances will be necessary in software development. we face major challenges in cracking the òcomplexitybarrieró in software and developing software systems that diagnose, repair, and protect themselves (national research council,2002 and 2000b). todayõs large, complex, and critical informationsystems may involve hundreds of thousands of computers, bebased on millions of lines of code, and operate almost continuously, making them more difficult to design and maintain, andvulnerable in unexpected ways. for example, a growing numberof largescale projects have either been cancelled without beingdeployed or have experienced significant problems in service(national research council, 2000b).the second caveat is to not confuse technological feasibilitywith commercial and social reality. changes in technology willbe enormous over the next 10 years (not to mention the next 20),and the rate of change is increasing. but individuals, as well associal institutions like the university, cannot rapidly changetheir behaviors. the fact that we are approaching a time inwhich communication and access to a great deal of the worldõsinformation will be possible in an instant and at nearzero costdoes not necessarily mean that education, or other sorts ofòknowledge work,ó will have changed at the same rate. whileinformation technology does hold out the promise of enablingadvances in the educational, research, and service functions ofthe research university, realizing this promise will require timeand considerable institutional adaptation.one of the universityõs greatest challenges, in fact, will bemanaging the great discrepancy between technological andpreparing for the revolution: information

technologicalcapabilities as best it can, while recognizing that the ability toretrieve data is not the same as knowledge and technical facilityis not the same as wisdom. such challenges are addressed inchapter 3.an extraordinary evolutionit is difficult to appreciate just how quickly informationtechnology is evolving. five decades ago eniac, one of theearliest computers, stood 10 feet tall,

1994).moreover, the time between such improvements is rapidlyshrinking. a $1,000 notebook computer now has more computing horsepower than a $20million supercomputer of theearly 1990s.this extraordinary pace of informationtechnology evolutionis not only expected to continue for the foreseeable future butcould well accelerate. for example, the newest supercomputersare capable of performing over 35 trillion calculations per second(normile, 2002; reuters, 2002). and computers yet a thousandtimes faster are currently under development for applicationssuch as the analysis of protein folding (mcdonald, 2001).for the first several decades of the information age, theevolution of digital technology followed the trajectory predictedby òmooreõs lawóña 1965 observation by intel founder gordonmoore that the density of transistors on a chip doubles every18months or so, thereby making it twice as powerful as before(or, alternatively viewed, half as costly). although this òlawówas intended to characterize siliconbased microprocessorsalone, it turns out that almost every aspect of digital technologyhas advanced at an exponential rate, with some technologiesmoving forward even faster (wulf, 1995). for example, diskareal densityñthe number of bits per square inch that can beput on a diskñhas been doubling every 12 months in recentyears and is expected to continue at that rate over the nearfuture.6in recent years, information technology has been mostdramatically driven not by the continuing increase in

bitpersecond modems were inwide use; now the localarea networks in our offices and homescommunicate at 10100 megabits per second and the backbonesystems for linking regional networks together typically run atgigabitpersecond speeds. with the rapid deployment of fiberoptic cables and optical switching, terabitpersecond networksare just around the corner (kahney, 2000). according to onemarket forecast of the next five years, fiberoptic cable will beinstalled throughout the world at an equivalent rate of thousandsof miles per hour, despite the severe spending slump afflictingthe telecommunications industry at the time this report wasbeing prepared.7 meanwhile, researchers are already experimenting with moving data at speeds of petabits per second.ibm reports success in the lab with communications in the8 to 10petabit range, and plans are already being made tomove such bandwidths into the marketplace (mcgarvey, 1999).some internet service providers expect to be employing them inperhaps three to five years for their internal traffic. for globalcommunications, intercontinental bandwidth has recentlyincreased from a relatively sclerotic 45 megabits to 88100 gigabits, made possible by new fiberoptic cable laid under themajor oceans.8from the average userõs point of view, the exponential ratedictated by mooreõs law will drive increases of 100 to 1,000 incomputing speed, storage capacity, and bandwidth everydecade. at that pace, todayõs $1,000notebook computer will, bythe year 2020, have a computing speed of 1 million gigahertz, amemory of thousands of

virtual world with thoseof their colleagues. as communications technology increases inpower by 100 fold (or more) each decade, such digitally mediated human interactions could take place with essentially anydegree of fidelity desired.predictions like these may seem like fantasy, but considerthe record: the penetration of digital technology into our societyhas proceeded at a remarkable pace. in less than a decade, theinternet has evolved from a relatively obscure research networkto a commercial infrastructure now actively utilized by 61 percent of u.s. households and essentially all of our schools andbusinesses (gartner group, 2001). on the global level, theinternet already connects hundreds of millions of people withone another, and estimates are that by the end of the decade thisnumber could grow into the billionsña substantial fraction ofthe worldõs population.9 such growth is expected to continuedespite, or perhaps as a result of, the recent rude awakenings ofebusiness investors to the realities of the marketplace.more uncertain than the technological trajectory is the statusof the business environment, which will greatly influence whenadvanced capabilities reach the marketplace. specific forecastsshould be treated with skepticism. for example, forecasts of the2004 worldwide ecommerce market made in early 2001 rangedfrom $1.4 trillion to $10 trillion (butler, 2001). in addition, theoverall u.s. and world economies experienced significant slowdowns during the year prior to publication of this report. still,even revised market forecasts predict continued growth ininformationtechnologyrelated industries, and this growth isexpected to accelerate as business conditions improve. althoughthe exact pace is difficult to predict, the clear trend is that muchof the growth in businesstobusiness commerce will be internetdriven.access to computers and the internet, and the ability to usethis technology, are thus becoming increasingly important tofull

difficult to assess their impact onsocial institutions such as universities with any accuracy. still,we must try to project, and allow for significant variation inwhat we can and cannot directly affect, as best we can.this chapter provides an overview of the unprecedentedtechnologydriven challenges currently being faced by highereducation, and by the research university in particular. thesechallenges are sufficiently great that even the worstcasescenarioñthe end of the university, an institution that has existedfor a millennium and truly become òan icon of our socialfabricóñappears to some to be a distinct possibility. the reasoning behind such an extreme prediction is that although theuniversity has survived earlier periods of technologydrivensocial change with its basic role

people and knowledge. thus the technology couldprofoundly reshape the activities of all institutions, such as theuniversity, whose central function is the creation, preservation,integration, transmission, or application of knowledge.the panel believes that while the university as a physicalplace is not in danger of disappearing any time soon, it isnevertheless critical for the highereducation community toprepare itself for change.10 and it must begin to do so by reconsidering the academic culture that sometimes allows the demandfor consensus to thwart action and in which consultation isoften defined as consent.it is encouraging that some challenges of informationtechnology are already being addressed by the highereducationenterprise. for example, regular sections on information technology and distance education have been features of thechronicle of higher education for some time. in addition, the longlist of references for this report and the involvement of notforprofit education providers (see examples in box 31), as well asforprofit entities, indicate that a great deal of activity hasoccurred and is continuing. universities are also workingtogether and with industry in the area of technology standardsto enable the broader changes advocated in this report.11however, experts within and outside academia observe thatthere is still a great deal of complacency in the research university, and that more intensive and structured communication atthe national and campus levels is necessary.12 the universitycould fare better in the future if it develops mechanisms to sensethe changes being wrought by information technology,speculates broadly on possible effects, and then respondsaccordinglyñwith carefully considered strategies backed byprudent investmentsñnot just to avoid extinction but to activelycultivate opportunity.learning and scholarship do require some independencefrom society. the research university in particular provides arelatively cloistered environment in which people can deeplyinvestigate fundamental problems in the natural sciences, socialsciences, and humanities, and can learn the art of analyzingdifficult problems. but the rapid and substantial changes instore for the universityñnot only those related to informationtechnologyñrequire that academics work with the institutionõsmany

drive is likely to be devoted tomp3 musicaudio files than to material related to classes. still,the napster phenomenon, which focused on university studentsõand other young adultsõ predilection to collect popularmusicrecordings at little or no cost, showed the potential power ofleveraging todayõs commodity hardware capabilities. one futuretest of success for academia is whether it is able to tap this latentpower for educational ends.but although it has been slow in coming, weõre beginning tosee the impact of information technology on teaching, and itseems to be driven not so much by faculty or administrators butby the learners themselves. a good number of todayõs youngpeople have spent their early lives amid visual electronic mediasuch as video games, and they often approach learning as aòplugandplayó experience. they expectñindeed, demandñinteraction; and they are unaccustomed to learning sequentially(e.g., to reading the manual). instead, theyõre inclined simply tojump in.it is, of course, important to distinguish between learningfacts and learning concepts, between answering simple factualquestions and making difficult judgement calls. just becauselearning and teaching environments utilize information technology does not mean that pedagogy and the substance of whatis being taught are any less important. while many of todayõsòdigital generationó of mediasavvy students are open to newapproaches, they will still need to think critically when engaging the materials they encounter, whether surfing the web orscanning the library stacks.13other students are less comfortable with information technology; indeed, some would see a threat in any challenge to thedeeply engrained notion that òtrue learningó must occur in atraditional classroom environment. incorporating new technology into teaching will thus require accommodation to variedlearning styles (passig and levin, 1999).yet we envision a future, enabled by information technologyand driven by learner demand, in which two of the major (andtakenforgranted) ways of organizing undergraduate learningwill recede in importance: the 55minute classroom lecture andthe common reading list. that digital future will challenge facultyto design technologybased experiences based primarily oninteractive, collaborative learning. although these newapproaches will be quite different from traditional ones, theypreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution26may be far more effective, particularly when provided througha mediarich environment (hanna, 2000). at the same time,information technology can actually enhance traditional normsof higher educationñfor example, through the òlivinglearningóparadigm made possible by web communities that grow aroundonline courses (young, 2002b).such changes also imply a different studentfaculty relationship than has traditionally been the case. students may be moreinvolved in the creation of learning environments, workingshoulder to shoulder with the faculty just as they do whenserving as research assistants. in that context, student and professor alike are apt to be experts, though in different domains.the faculty member of the twentyfirst century universitycould thus become more of a consultant or coach than a teacher,less concerned with transmitting intellectual content directlythan with inspiring, motivating, and managing an active learning process.14 that is, faculty may come to interact with undergraduates in ways that resemble how they interact with theirdoctoral students today.higher education is already heavily wired, with 90 percentof fouryearcollege students going online at least once a day(greenfield online, 2000). but in keeping with the academyõscustomary taste for incremental change, it was natural that theearliest applications of information technology on campusshould involve the enhancement of traditional courses. forexample, electronic mail and computer conferencing were usedto augment classroom discussions, while the internet providedaccess to original source materials. meanwhile, the first applications of computeraidedinstruction technology attempted toautomate the more routine aspects of learning.in other words, consistent with its early applications of othertechnologies, higher education tended to use digital networkssimply to repurpose the traditional lecture course for onlineaccess (newman and scurry, 2000). similarly, multimedia networks were used simply as an internet extension of correspondence or broadcast courses to enhance distance learning.the most dramatic impacts on university education are yetto comeñwhen learning experiences are reconceptualized tocapture the power of information technology. although theclassroom is unlikely to disappear, at least as a place wherestudents and faculty can regularly come together, the traditional lecture format of a faculty member addressing a group ofpreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national

technology, telepresence, and teleimmersion (the ability of geographically dispersed sites to collaborate in real time). sophisticatednetworks and software environments can be used to break theclassroom loose from the constraints of place and time to makelearning available any place, any time, and to any one. theoutlines of what will be possible can even now be seen in therealtime collaboration and projectmanagement tools that arebecoming common in the corporate environment.the attractiveness of computermediated distance learning,or òdistributed learning,ó is obvious to adult learners whosework or family obligations bar their routine presence on conventional campuses. but perhaps a more surprising applicationof computerbased distance learning is the degree to whichmany oncampus students are now using it to augment theirtraditional education.15 broadband digital networks andmulticasting can be used to enhance the multimedia capacity ofhundreds of classrooms across campus and link them with residence halls and libraries. electronic mail has already alteredfacultystudent interactions in fundamental ways; professorsare now much more accessible to their students, as well as to thewider world, than was the case just a few years ago. the apparentdownside for some is a decline in informal interactions duringoffice hours and other facetoface settings (connolly, 2001).meanwhile, online learning enrollments are reportedlygrowing at a 33 percent annual rate, and are expected to reach2.2 million by 2004.16 despite the wellpublicized failure ofseveral elearning initiatives, 150 institutions now offer onlineundergraduate degrees and an even greater number offergraduate degrees; and a recent report anticipates that the u.s.elearning market will recover from the dot.com bust and growto a size of nearly $14 billion by 2004 (booz allen hamilton,2002). little wonder that there has been explosive activity in thecommercial sector to create both the content and technologythat support this enterprise. while the report points out thatcorporate and specialized professional training present thegreatest growth prospects, it also notes the opportunities forcompanies that help universities expand elearningõs role incampusbased instruction.developing and deploying highquality distributedlearningcurricula can be difficult and expensive, however. creatingpreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution28online courses is considerably more complex than simply posting lecture notes or powerpoint presentations on the web orvideostreaming the òtalking headsó of lecturing professors(young, 2000a). nevertheless, faculty around the country aregaining expertise in how to turn traditional courses into distancelearning courses (carnevale, 2000a and 2000b) and how to blendtraditional and online elements (young, 2002b), and they arereaping significant rewards.but there are barriers to such innovation as well. youngfaculty members who may have the best skills to develop newinformationtechnology approaches to teaching are concernedthat this work will not be taken into account in tenure andpromotion decisions, although this policy may be changing atsome institutions (young, 2002a). with competing demands ontheir time, even tenured faculty members may not have sufficientincentive to devote time to utilizing information technology increative ways. in addition, the question of whether individualfaculty or the institution owns òcourseware,ó and otherintellectualproperty issues, are being raised. these are discussedfurther below.meanwhile, universities are increasingly outsourcing muchof the technology and expertise necessary for distributed learning from commercial providers, such as blackboard and webct,which produce coursemanagement systems. they alsodistribute content in partnership with several educational publishers.17 these activities are, of course, still evolving. questionssuch as who is responsible for changing material as the fieldevolves and the extent and type of instructional interactionrequired will be answered over time. issues such as theapparently higher attrition rates for webbased (as opposed totraditional) courses also need to be addressed (carr, 2000a).the development of effective òedutainmentó by educationalinstitutions in partnership with the entertainment industry, usingprofessional actors and production methods, is another futurepossibility. given the buying power of the target audience, 18to 25yearolds with high income potential, the developmentcould be underwritten by commercial sponsors. in a scenariothat seems extreme today, large parts of the general undergraduate curriculum could join college football and basketballas commercialized edutainment, facing university leadershipwith challenges similar to those now being encountered withregard to sports (duderstadt, 2000b).preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all

cyberspace, without campus or perhaps evenfaculty, solely to provide distributedlearning opportunities.unburdened by most of the usual academic constraints, suchvirtual universities can experiment with a variety of new forms.some, such as michigan virtual university (www.mivu.org),serve only as brokers, providing marketing channels that allowtraditional colleges and universities to be òsuppliersó of educational services to a distributed marketplace. others, such as theuniversity of phoenix, attempt to provide a more completearray of highereducation offerings, including instruction, librarysupport, and administrative services. its continuing success intransferring its profitable model of parttime education forworking adults into cyberspace constitutes an example to otherentities (forprofits and nonprofits) seeking to reach the sameaudience.there are examples of companies creating online universities by disaggregating the overall production of educationalprograms and selectively outsourcing each component.18 theyhire researchuniversity faculties (to determine content),cognitive scientists (to develop pedagogy and courseware), andinstructors (to guide students and develop assessment tools tomonitor learning). similarly, the commercial functions of marketing and distribution can also be disaggregated and outsourced.by whatever route, distributed learning based on computermediated paradigms allows universities to push their campusboundaries outward to serve diverse types of learners. it alsofacilitates new forms of pedagogy more responsive to a knowledgebased societyñin which learning becomes a pervasive,lifetime need. thus the traditional paradigm of òjustincaseódegreebased education may be augmented, or replaced, byparadigms of òjust in timeó and customized òjustforyouóñwhereby learners will have increased responsibility to select,design, and control the learning environment.but even as the number of students, institutions, and commercial organizations participating in distance education grows,it is not clear which business models or structures will ultimately succeed. during the time that the panel was completingthis study, several forprofit distanceeducation subsidiarieslaunched by universities either went under or showed clearsigns of stress (carlson and carnevale, 2001; blumenstyk, 2001;òour traditional wayof

they ofteninvolve merely putting classroom offerings online withoutfundamentally rethinking their approaches (young, 2001b).clearly, the notion that distance education through the internetwould generate substantial revenues quickly and easily hasbeen dispelled. at the same time, there is growing institutionalinterest in fostering creation of nonproprietary, opencoursecontent and management tools (young, 2001a; carr, 2001).in that spirit, it is important to note that in evaluating theprogress of informationtechnology utilization in the researchuniversity, the role of distance learning by itself should not beoveremphasized. as the discussion at the beginning of thissection indicates, the integration of computer and communications technologies into traditional academic structuresñand thecreation of new structures, as mitõs ocw initiative is attemptingñmay have more longterm impact than the distanceeducation industry per se.the flood of new initiatives in this area launched in the1999ð2000 period has given way to a shakeout during 2001ð2002, as some universities have been shuttering or scaling backtheir dedicated online units. at this point, it appears that theinitiatives likely to survive are those that had been establishedin the mainstream of the university with a clear mission to helpmodernize the institution.research unboundedso, too, is information technology changing the nature ofresearch. the earliest applications, often limited by computercapacity, were directed at relatively simple mathematical problems in science and engineering. today, available processingpower is much less of a constraint; problems that used to requirethe computational capacity of rooms full of supercomputers cannow be tackled with laptop machines.the rapid evolution of this technology is also enablingscientists to address previously unsolvable problemsñcustomdesigning new organic molecules, analyzing the complexdynamics of the global climate, or simulating the birth of

contributions than others; new database and modeling tools, for example, are unexpectedly changing fields that had previously made little use of computingpower.new types of research organizations, such as òcollaboratoriesó(farflung networks of researchers and laboratories) are appearing that could not have existed without this new technology(national research council, 1993 and 2001a). recognizing thatinformation technology is a crucial enabler of advances across awide range of scientific and engineering fields, both new andestablished, the national science foundation is developing acyberinfrastructure initiative to better integrate instruments,sensors, supercomputers, and highspeed communications networks (trimble, 2001). such efforts may make it possible forcollaboratories to attack largescale science and engineeringproblems requiring diverse, multidisciplinary talent.actually, some of the most powerful applications of information technology have already begun occurring in thehumanities, social sciences, and the arts. scholars now use digitallibraries such as jstor (www.jstor.org) or artstor to access,search, and analyze complete collections of scholarly journals orworks of art (mellon foundation, 2001). archeologists aredeveloping virtualreality simulations of remote sites andoriginal materials, such as papyrus manuscripts, that can beaccessed by colleagues throughout the world.meanwhile, social scientists are using powerful softwaretools to analyze massive data sets of materials collected throughinterviews and field studies. and practitioners of the

the creative experience of the artistthan on the analytical skills of the scientist.of all the researchuniversity roles examined in this chapter,research would appear to be the one that institutions are bestprepared to adapt to new realities. indeed, federally fundeduniversity research has played a critically important role increating and nurturing the very technologies discussed here(national research council, 1999). but while the researchuniversity may face relatively greater informationtechnologychallenges in teaching, outreach, and management than inresearch, the researchrelated challenges are not trivial. maintaining the federalgovernment/university partnership as adriver in the pursuit of fundamental knowledge and as an engineof u.s. and global innovation will require strong commitmentfrom both partners. new modes of cooperation across agencies,institutions, and departments may be needed to fund andeffectively utilize the cyberinfrastructure that will enabletomorrowõs breakthroughs.engaging industry as a partner in research is also an issue.as discussed below, the university research enterprise hasbecome more focused on commercialization and the launch ofnew ventures than in years past. the new thinking about information technology occurring in the university environmentcould be an additional magnet for industry interest.these and other issues have global implications. given theintensely international nature of todayõs research, with growingcollaboration across distance enabled by information technology,the way that the u.s. research university harnesses new technology in the service of science and engineering is critical notonly at home. it is bound to affect scholars and institutionsaround the world.preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.implications for the research university33preserving andcommunicating knowledgethe preservation of scholarly knowledge is one of the mostrapidly changing functions of the university. the computer, ormore precisely the òdigital convergenceó of various mediañfrom print to graphics to sound to sensory experiences throughvirtual realityñmay ultimately have a greater impact on knowledge than the printing press.throughout the centuries, the intellectual focal point of theuniversity has been its library, its collection of written workspreserving the knowledge of civilization. today such knowledge exists in numerous formsñincluding almost literally inthe ether, distributed in digital representations over worldwidenetworksñand it is not just the prerogative of the privilegedfew in academe but is accessible to many.for example, the hypertext link is overshadowing the printbibliographic citation, making original source materials available to all via their own computers. but this is only the tip of theiceberg. the distinction between the book and the library mayitself become blurred as the internet evolves into a seamlessmesh for probing the worldõs òcollection.ó similarly, becauseknowledge is not inherently compartmentalized, some disciplinary boundaries may actually devolve. even without theinternet, albert einstein maintained that many of the mostcritical research challenges lay at the intersections of disciplines.technology is now increasingly in hand for exploring thoseintersections.the library is thus becoming less of a collection house andmore of a center for knowledge navigation, a facilitator of information retrieval and dissemination. in addition to utilizing thenew òlibrary without walls,ó scholars and students are increasingly able to access sources directly. as with learning, newelectronic media allow the formation of spontaneous communities of unacquainted users, linked together in the manytomanytopology of computer networks. researchers can now followthe work in their specialization on a daybyday basis throughweb sites.these new realities are giving rise to new challenges as well.the archiving of digital materials is one example. scholars

obsolete wordprocessing software or stored on an obsolete storage medium.the management and preservation of information from shortlived magnetic recording media to ensure future accessibilityhas not yet been comprehensively addressed. other issuesinclude potential intellectual distortions resulting from the factthat only relatively recent materials (e.g., journal articles) areavailable online, and the need for universities to carefully manage heightened demand for access to some paper collectionsstimulated by electronic access.scholarship is still characterized and constrained by thepublication of research findings, though this system is fast getting competition as a result of new information technologies(odlyzko, 2000). the resulting confusion has not yet beenresolved: traditional scholarly publication, through established(and extraordinarily costly) journals characterized by peerreview, is being challenged by less formal netbased communication that links scholars essentially instantaneously. the centralchallenge will be to preserve the benefits of the old system, inwhich the review process provides cohesion to a given field,while taking advantage of the speed and ease of access promised by new media.but here too, the technology is evolving. for example, websites are increasingly serving as portals to integrate material ofvalue to particular scholarly pursuits.19 ultimately, the mostprofound changes will involve software agents (bradshaw, 1997),though such developments lie some years down the road.the business environment of academic publishing is also animportant factor. publishers have consolidated and sought tocreate a business model in which online access to journals willdrive profits, but they are faced with several highprofile effortsto expand free online access (vaidhyanathan, 2001). a coalitionof research libraries, universities, and other organizations knownas the scholarly publishing and academic resources coalition(sparc) is one group seeking to develop common approaches(www.arl.org/sparc).meanwhile, our capacity to reproduce and distribute digitalinformation with perfect accuracy at essentially zero cost hasshaken the very

about unscrambling encrypted digital musicillustrates how changing notions of ownership and academicfreedom are coming into conflict (foster, 2001). the uniformcomputer information transactions act (ucita), a contractlaw statute for software developed by the national conferenceof commissioners on uniform state laws and adopted byseveral states, has sparked opposition from a range of groups(foster, 2000).indeed, the legal and economic management of universityintellectual property is rapidly becoming one of the most criticaland complex issues facing higher education (national researchcouncil, 2001d). intellectualproperty concerns are often mentioned as a barrier to greater faculty activity in developing newuses of information technology, along with the perceived undervaluing of such efforts in tenure evaluations (carnevale andyoung, 1999).impact on the form, function,and financing of theuniversityjust as new forms of teaching, researching, and preservingknowledge are being stimulated by rapidly evolving information technology, so too will the universityõs organization,management, governance, and relationships between students,faculty, and staff require serious reevaluation and almostcertainchange. for example, the new tools of scholarship and scholarlycommunication will erode conventional disciplinary boundaries,likely extending the intellectual interests and activities of facultyfar beyond traditional academic units such as departments orschools (national research council, 2001a). this blurring ofdisciplinary boundaries does not necessarily contradict the growing need for institutions to build and maintain unique strengths,pointed out earlier in this chapter. these core strengths may bein new fields that combine insights from several traditionaldisciplines.beyond driving a restructuring of the intellectual disciplines,information technology could force a significant disaggregationof many traditional university services, ranging from studenthousing to health care to teaching itself (massy, 2001; newman,¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution362001; weiland, 2000). colleges and universities will increasinglyface the question of whether they should continue their fullcomplement of activities or outsource some functions to lowercost and frequently higherquality providers.this will pose a particular challenge to faculty, long accustomed to controlling the design of curriculum and supervisingthe learning environment. higher education as a cottage industry, in which individual courses are made to order by individualfaculty, may not be able to compete much longer in either costor quality with commodity educational products (newman andcouturier, 2001).similarly, universities will face a major challenge in retaining instructional òmindshareó among their most accomplishedfaculty. higher education adapted long ago to the reality offaculty members negotiating release time and very substantialfreedom with regard to research activities. there may be newchallenges as instructional content becomes a valuable commodity in a forprofit education marketplace (thompson, 1999).some would argue that faculty members should be free tocontract with outside organizations in developing instructionallearningware; such activity is deemed analogous to scholarsauthoring textbooks and retaining the royalties. others maintainthat institutions have an ownership interest in such intellectualproperty. could policies to restrict such activity be acceptable,or enforceable, in the highly competitive marketplace that existsfor leading faculty?it is possible that weõll ultimately see an òunbundlingó offaculty and students from the university, with faculty membersacting as freelance consultants, selling their services andknowledge to the highest bidder; and students acting as mobileconsumers, able to procure educational services from a highlycompetitive marketplace (brown, 1996). even short of thisextreme vision, information technology will likely allow atleast some researchuniversity and other highereducationfunctions to be unbundledñand, where useful, rebundled innew ways.movement toward this model would pose a number ofchallenges to institutions. for example, a student is now considered officially educated when he or she has taken the requiredcredits. but the panel believes that significant learning

university. transcripts of courses taken thus underestimate a studentõs education. this problem is apt to beexacerbated as we (correctly) push for more flexibility in how,when, and where we learn.in contrast to the image of òfree agentó professors reapingprofits from their learningware, there is an alternative scenarioin which incentives for faculty to create new informationtechnologybased approaches to education are too weak. if thebusiness environment for educational software and contentwareis not as favorable as some have anticipated, a gifted youngprofessor might be committing professional suicide by spending large amounts of time creating it. this is a particular risk inthe research university, where such activities are not currentlyan advantage in gaining tenure.the university faces a particular challenge not only inrewarding the creation of new learning environments but alsoin ensuring a technologyliterate faculty in the first place. somefaculty members have not kept pace with technologyõs evolution, and they are unprepared for the new plugandplaygeneration of students. according to a recent survey of seniorinformationtechnology administrators by the campus computing project, 40 percent cited òincorporating technology intothe classroomó as the most important issue they face; yet only14percent said that technology had improved instruction todate (carlson, 2000).in earlier times, we would simply wait for a generation ofprofessors to retire before an academic unit could evolve. but intodayõs fastpaced world, when the doubling time for technologyevolution has collapsed to a few years or less, we must look foreffective ways to reskill the faculty members whose careers arefar from over.actually, almost all of a universityõs adultsñfaculty, staff,administrators, whomeverñneed to be reskilled in appreciatinghow todayõs student is so effortlessly digital across all boundaries (which are rapidly fading). this issue seldom gets seriousattention, even though the ubiquitous presence of computersand other electronic devicesñhandheld digital assistants andportable telephones, for exampleñaffects student life at least asmuch as it does academic programs. in fact, students oftenmake little distinction between the two; they see technology as apreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research

granted just as they do the air theybreathe. woe to the university that doesnõt grasp this.but understanding the need is one thing, and paying for it isanother. thus another major challenge to the university isfinancial. the bill for information technology is growing fasterthan those of other categories (olsen, 2001b). for a very largecampus, it can amount to hundreds of millions of dollars peryear.20 it is paradoxical that institutions are spending more andmore as a given level of hardware capability becomes less andless costly. this trend underlines not only the special challengesfaced in higher education but the difficulty that virtually allorganizations have experienced in utilizing information technology to improve productivity (massy and zemsky, 1995).historically, universities have seen technology as a capitalexpenditure to serve only a select few, and more or less as anexperimental tool. it is often paid for with yearend savings andother òbudget dustó (olsen, 2001a). though times have changed,most universities still do not have a modern and sustainablefinancial model for investing in information technology; theirplanning is largely limited to longterm faculty appointmentsand even longerterm physical facilities. trying to satisfy constituentsõ needs for informationtechnology infrastructurerequires very rapid turnover in largescale investments, andthus an agility not usually found in a budgeting culture.nevertheless, some universities are beginning to realizesignificant cost savings in administrative areas such as purchasing through the effective use of information technology (olsen,2002). this shows that it is possible to invest wisely in newcapability that delivers concrete benefits. not surprisingly, thekey to meeting this challenge appears to be the creation andcareful management of an organizational structure for tappingthe new technology.impact on the highereducation enterprisecoupled with new societal needsñubiquitous adult education,

highereducation enterprise (duderstadt, 1999).judging from the makeovers in other sectors of the economy,such as health care, transportation, communications, and energy,we should expect to see mergers, acquisitions, new competitors,and new products in higher education as well. more generally,we may well see the rise of a global òknowledge and learningóindustry, in which the activities of traditional academicinstitutions converge with those of other knowledgeintensiveorganizations such as telecommunications, entertainment, andinformationservices companies.such convergence is being driven by the increasing importance of human capital to our knowledgebased economy, whichdepends so heavily on brainpower, ideas, and entrepreneurship(national research council, 2001c). although the employmentand economic situation is weak as this report goes to press, it isclear to many business leaders that obtaining, training, andretaining skilled workers are still critical longterm priorities(itaa, 2001).the panel agrees with the general assertion that theemergence of òknowledge workó and òknowledge workersó iscrucial to the future development of the global economy andsociety (drucker, 1999 and 2001). this notion of òknowledgeworkó encompasses more than activity directly related to information technology per se; it implies a riseñin nearly all sectorsof todayõs workforceñof professionals who depend on andmanipulate information almost exclusively.a key factor at present in pushing higher education towardrestructuring is the emergence of aggressive forprofit education providers intent on satisfying this information demand(goldstein, 2000). most of these new entrants, such as the university of phoenix21 and jones international university,22 arenow focusing on the adulteducation market as well as corporate training (hanna, 2000). but they also have more expansivegoals in mind.having invested heavily in sophisticated instructionalcontent, pedagogy, and assessment tools, these providers arewell positioned to offer broader educational programs, both atthe undergraduate level and in professional areas such as engineering and law. thus the initial focus of new forprofit entrantson basic adult education is misleading; in the foreseeable future,preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution40their capacity to compete with traditional colleges and universities in some areas could be formidable indeed.to be sure, some forecasts of demand for distance learningin areas such as business education have proven overlyoptimistic, at least for the near term (mangan, 2001; shea, 2001).but clearly the university will lose its monopoly on students,faculty, and resources, and in the absence of bold commercialalliances it is likely to lose market share to forprofit competitorsin its traditional areas of strength.the research university will face particular challenges inthis regard. although rarely acknowledged, the research university relies heavily on crosssubsidies from lowcost, highprofit instruction in general education (e.g., large lecture courses)and lowcost professional training (such as in business administration and law) to support graduate training and research inthe science and engineering fields (newman, 2000; newmanand couturier, 2001). these highprofit programs are, notcoincidentally, very attractive targets for technologybased, forprofit competitors. their success in the highereducation marketplace could therefore undermine the current business model ofthe research university and imperil its core activities. this couldbe a politically explosive issue for some of the state universitiesas they try to maintain and increase public support from statelegislatures.further, as a knowledgedriven economy becomes ever moredependent on new ideas and innovation, there will be growingpressures to commercialize the universityõs intellectual assetsñits faculty and students, its capacity for basic and appliedresearch, and the knowledge generated through its scholarshipand instructionñwhich become ever more valuable (olcott andschmidt, 2000). public policy, through federal actions such asthe bayhdole act of 1980, has encouraged the transfer of knowledge from campus to marketplace. but because knowledge canbe transferred not only through formal mechanisms such aspatents and licensing but also through the migration of facultyand students, there is a risk that the rich intellectual assets of theuniversity will be depleted as support for graduate educationand research erodes.even with faculty and students remaining in academia, theresearch university faces particular conflicts in the commercialization arena. while transforming knowledge into public benefithas long been a major component of its mission, expectationspreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.implications for the research university41for university contributions to regional and national economicdevelopment are growing. universities are thus forming anarray of ambitious partnerships with industry, and are doingmore to support faculty entrepreneurship (guirr, 2000 and2001).yet some decry the growth of commercial forces and incentives on campus (press and washburn, 2000) as a threat to thebasic values of the university. moreover, societyõs experience sofar with marketdriven, mediabased enterprises has not beenaltogether positive. the experience of the broadcasting and publishing industries suggests that a narrow focus on shorttermfinancial results can lead to mediocrity.one can imagine a scenario, for example, in which the campusdoes not disappear but, because of the escalating costs of residential education, becomes priced beyond the range of all butthe most affluent. much of the population would then be limitedto lowercost education via nonresidential learning centers orcomputermediated distance learning. indeed, critics see theexpansion of distance education as the leading edge of a movement to commercialize higher education and òdeprofessionalizeóthe faculty (noble, 2001).while the commercial model of the newer forprofit institutions may be a very effective way to meet the workplaceskillneeds of many adults, the committee believes that it is notñorat least, not yetña paradigm suitable to many of the otherpurposes of the university, including the educational value ofdirect interaction with excellent teachers. also, the traditionalbrickandmortar campus has provided a desirable social environment that contributes substantially to student maturationand to growth into participative citizenship.thus even though we must be mindful of market forces andwilling to respond to them as creatively and substantially aspossible, the panel believes that they should not be allowed todominate and reshape the highereducation enterprise all bythemselves. otherwise, we could well find ourselves facing aòbrave new worldó in which some of the most important valuesand traditions of the university have fallen by the wayside.as we assess these emerging marketdriven learning institutions, we must bear in mind the importance of preserving theability of the university to serve a broader public purpose. whileuniversities teach skills and convey knowledge, they also preserve our cultural heritage and convey it

universityõs role inthe changing highereducation infrastructure? it would beimpractical and foolhardy to suggest precise models; the greatand everincreasing diversity of the u.s. citizenry and workforcemakes it clear that there will be many forms of education andmany types of institutions serving our country. but a number ofthemes will almost certainly factor into the highereducationenterprise.in a series of reports prepared during the latter half of the1990s, the kellogg commission on the future of state and landgrant universities charted a future course for an importantsubset of americaõs research universities (kellogg commission,2001). the commission examined the range of internal changesand external forces shaping the future of state and landgrantuniversities, and did not focus particularly on informationtechnology. in recasting the traditional landgrant missionsñeducation, research, and extensionñas learning, discovery, andengagement, it urged universities to reengage with society andplay a more extensive role than in the past.information technology can clearly help universities realizethe kellogg commissionõs vision. one important area, whichthis present study was not able to examine comprehensively, isemphasis on the extension (or òengagementó) mission. examplesof how this may occur can be seen in fields such as social work,where universities are experimenting with new ways to assistpractitioners in the field through information technology(ouelette, 2001).the panel believes that just as other social institutions havedone, universities must become more focused on those theyserve. they must transform themselves from facultycenteredto learnercentered entities, becoming more responsive to whatstudents need to learnñwhenever, wherever, and however theywish to learn itñrather than simply cater to what faculties wishto teach. this will become a bigger challenge than ever before

internet has the potential to be a òdemocratizingóforce, extending educational opportunities to those currentlyunderserved by traditional colleges and universities.to meet the needs of a knowledgedriven society, it is clearthat very broad access to education is a high priority. one of theimportant challenges of the researchuniversity community willbe to sustain, intellectually and financially, a òculture ofexcellenceó with the required selectivity of faculty and studentswhile at the same time providing the foundation for universaleducation.the research university will undoubtedly play a role inmeeting the growing demand for costeffective educationalopportunities. this may involve increased cooperation withother components of the highereducation system such as stateuniversities and community colleges, which have long beenaccomplished providers of affordable education.in an age of knowledge, lifelong learning is especially critical. the concept of student and alumnus will merge. our highlypartitioned schooling system may well blend increasingly into aseamless web, in which primary and secondary education; undergraduate, graduate, and professional education; onthejobtraining and continuing education; and lifelong enrichmentbecome a continuum. in this vision of the future, people will becontinually surrounded by and absorbed in learning experiences.information technologies are now providing not only themeans to create growthinducing environments throughout thelives of learners; the technologies themselves will be able tolearn and grow throughout their own service lives. increasinglydriven by artificial intelligence and genetic algorithms, suchsystems will be capable of evolving to serve humanityõs changing educational needs.in all, information technology is rapidly becoming a liberating force in our society, not only freeing us from the mentaldrudgery of routine tasks but also creating new types of learning communities and, more generally, connecting us with oneanother in ways we never dreamed possible. higher educationmust define its relationship with these emerging trends of thedigital age in order to adapt, grow, and continue to excel.preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the

clearly poses many challengesfor higher education in general and the researchuniversity in particular. but while the challenges aresignificant, so too are the opportunities to enhancethe important social role of these institutions. the panelendeavored to reflect that spirit in this study.as noted in chapter 2, we can expect enormous technologicalchanges over the next 10 years, and with an everincreasingrateof change. yet chapter 3 observes that individual humanbeings cannot modify their behaviors with respect to technologyas rapidly as the technology itself is changing. social institutions such as the law and the university have an even greaterinertia with respect to exploiting new technology.23 academiasgreatest challenge, therefore, will be to resolve this great andgrowing discrepancy. in order to avoid squandering resources,exhausting faculty, and disappointing students, the highereducation communityand particularly the research universityneeds to develop agile processes for experimenting with andassessing alternative courses of action.some might argue that while other societal institutions havebeen transformed or made obsolete by information technology,this is no guarantee that the same will happen to the researchuniversity. after all, given the important role of this institutionin society and the economy, and its political strength at thestatehouse and national levels, it has proven able to resist ordeflect outside pressures in the past. for example, some mightargue that inexhaustible demand for the research universitysdegreegranting, or credentialing, role will ensure a steadystream of students regardless of the intrinsic educational qualityit offers.preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution46although the panel is not in a position to prove its argumentsbeyond all doubt, we note that a significant number of experts,both panel members and others of diverse outlooks, predict thathigher education will undergo significant change as a result ofinformationtechnology advances (collis, 2000; duderstadt,2000a; gilbert, 1995; katz, 1999; newman and scurry, 2000;noble, 2001).in addition, chapter 3 discussed several trends affectinghigher education that may not trace their origins to digitaltechnology but that the panel expects will be catalyzed bytechnological change to further transform institutions and educational processes. for example, there is a growing demand foruniversal, lowercost, lifelong education tailored to the needs oflearners, as contrasted with the more exclusive, expensive,traditionally structured approaches that the research universityand other elite institutions have been accustomed to determining themselves and uniquely providing. the panel expects thisgrowing demand will be met in part, perhaps in large part,through the expansion of current forprofit educational providersor the success of new entrants. in any case, technology is helpingto enable this shift.another trend that has spurred some controversy is thegrowing linkage between the research university and thecommercial world. concerns raised about this linkage generallyfocus on the potential compromising of academic researchactivities (press and washburn, 2000). but some critics worrythat the recent rush by universities to establish forprofit subsidiaries specializing in distance education is a mechanism fordeprofessionalizing the faculty (noble, 2001). this movement,they suggest, could presage a future in which education isdelivered by information technology and courses are createdby teams of adjunct faculty, contract lecturers, and technicalhelpers rather than by tenured professors, with the coursesowned by the university (noble, 2001).whether or not one shares these particular concerns, it isclear that a range of futures is possible for the research university. the panel believes that institutions, working with theirconstituents, can develop and fulfill a vision for the future inwhich information technology is a vehicle for sustaining andexpanding their core values and missions. the research university can be more effective in education, teach in entirely newways, reach a wider segment of the u.s. population, and meetpreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

broader society. it can becomeeven more central to the intellectual and social life of our communities and the nation as a whole than it has been before.given the pace of technological change, and the nontechnological pressures mentioned above, the next decade willbe a critical time for individual institutions and for the highereducation enterprise as a whole. while the transformation of theresearch university is more or less inevitable, it is important thatthe changes be proactive and the result of serious selfexamination. the aforementioned rush to establish forprofitdistancelearning subsidiaries, some of which have alreadyexpired while others are in trouble, is an example of changehastily undertaken by institutions in reaction to trends of themoment and the fear of being left behind. we can learn agreat deal by examining this experience.significant findingsgiven this context, the panels main findings are as follows:the extraordinary pace of informationtechnologyevolution is likely not only to continue for the next severaldecades but could well accelerate. it will erode, and in somecases obliterate, higher educations usual constraints of spaceand time. institutional boundaries will be reshaped and possiblytransformed.the impact of information technology on the researchuniversity will likely be profound, rapid, and discontinuousjust as it has been and will continue to be for our other socialinstitutions and the economy. there are likely to be majortechnological surprises, comparable in significance to thepersonal computer in the late 1970s and the internet browser in1994, but at more frequent intervals. the future is becoming lesspredictable.digital technology will not only transform the intellectualactivities of the research

education with itintensive sectors such as publishing,telecommunications, and entertainment, creating a globalknowledge and learning industry.procrastination and inaction are dangerous courses forthe university during a time of rapid technological change,although institutions will also need to avoid making hastyresponses to current trends. just as in earlier periods of change,the university will have to adapt itself to a radically changingworld while protecting its most important values and traditions, such as academic freedom, a rational spirit of inquiry, andliberal learning.for at least the near term, meaning a decade or less, theresearch university will continue to exist in much its presentform. but it must devote itself during this interval to anticipatingthe needed changes, developing appropriate strategies, andmaking adequate investments if it is to prosper thereafter.over the longer term, the basic character and structure ofthe research university may be challenged by the technologydriven forces of aggregation (new alliances, for example, andthe conversion of the academic marketplace into a globalindustry) and disaggregation (such as restructuring of theacademic disciplines, detachment of faculty and students fromparticular universities, and decoupling of research andeducation).although we are confident that information technologywill continue its rapid growth for the foreseeable future andmay ultimately have profound impacts on human behavior andsocial institutions such as the research university, it is far moredifficult to predict these impacts with any precision. nevertheless, higher education must develop mechanisms to at leastsense the potential changes and to aid in the understanding ofwhere the technology may drive it.it is therefore important that university strategies include:the development of sufficient inhouse expertise among facultyand staff to track technological trends and assess various coursesof action; the opportunity for experimentation; and the ability toform alliances with other academic institutions as well as withforprofit and governmental organizations.preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.choosing the future: findings and options49discovering options: the needfor continued dialoguealthough part of its charge was to make policy recommendations, the panel ultimately decided not to do so in this firstphase of activity. one factor in this decision was that information technology is evolving so rapidly that any prescriptive setof conclusions and recommendations could quickly become outdated. also, the panel was unable to examine the numerousissues bearing on the topic (such as the state and federal funding environment for higher education, intellectual property lawsand practices, regulatory and certification issues, informationprivacy, and information security) with the depth needed forrecommending policy changes. the focus of our examination ofneeds and priorities for action was on what institutions themselves and their broader constituencies (which definitely includesstate and federal governments) need to monitor, explore, learn,and understand at this time.the panel believes that the highereducation communityshould create ongoing mechanisms for: monitoring technological changes and the consequentscholarly, educational, and social shifts. identifying crucial issues, challenges, and opportunitiesfor the research university and the broader highereducationenterprise. stimulating awareness on the campuses. making recommendations for actions or further studies.the national academies has been awarded funding tolaunch such an effort through the governmentuniversityindustry research roundtable. this process will address theneed for monitoring and expanded dialogue not only on campusbut at the national level. it will involve technology specialists aswell as experts in higher education and state and federal policymakers. of course, it will also involve faculty from thehumanities, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering,and students themselves.¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all

environments affect the need for traditional teachercentered instruction? how will the residential campus experience beaffected? what are the implications for graduate training in the researchuniversity, where graduatestudent assistants carry a large share of theteaching load?2.how will informationtechnology advances affect the ways in whichuniversities tackle major research problems? what new partnerships amonginstitutions and other constituents (e.g., federal agencies, state governments)are needed for efficient development of the necessary tools?3.how can the research university become more effective in the planning,procurement, and management of it infrastructure? what operational andmanagement changes are needed? how can the needs of diverse campusconstituencies be better anticipated and addressed? what roles should beplayed by faculty, students, and administrators?4.what new policiesñfor example, on intellectual property, copyright,instructionalcontent ownership, and faculty contractsñdoes the researchuniversity need to reconsider in light of evolving it?for the highereducation enterprise and its public stakeholders1.how should the research university address the rapidly evolving commercialmarketplace for educational services and contentñincluding, in particular,the forprofit and dot.com providers? how should universities grapple withthe forces of aggregationñand disaggregationñassociated withtechnologydriven restructuring of the highereducation enterprise?what new alliances are necessary? will universities be forced to mergeinto larger units, as the corporate world has done (though not always withgreat success)? will they find it necessary to outsource or spin off existingactivities?2.what are the state and national interests in keeping the universities in stepwith evolving information technology? what changes in state and federalpolicies, programs, and investments are necessary in order for highereducation to flourish in the digital age?preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.choosing the future: findings and options51why is such an an intensive, expanded dialogue necessary?one reason is the complexity and broad range of issues relatedto information technology and the research university. thispanel took a broad look at the technological, institutional, andpolicy issues. given the time and resources available, it was ableto cover considerable ground but was unable to delve intoissues at great depth. some important topics, such as the impactof information technology on the service and outreach missionsof the research university, were treated only superficially. anexpanded national dialogue will allow a deeper examination ofthe broad range of issues.a second reason for a continuing dialogue is that the researchuniversity itself, its internal component groups, and its keyexternal constituents come to the issues with different interestsand perspectives. this report has touched on some of thosedifferences. effective communication and better common understanding will be necessary to effectively manage the consensualchange processes in higher education.administrators, faculty, and students, for example, come tothe issues with different experiences, expectations, and concerns. university governing bodies and state governments arecharged with ensuring effective management of the universityand responsiveness to the public interest, yet this oversight isnecessarily colored by their respective political and institutionalinterests. federal agencies, foundations, industry, and thevarious highereducation associations are key researchuniversity constituents with their own particular perspectives.in this regard, several nonprofit groups and universitybasedinstitutes that are focused on the future of higher education orthe use of information technology may contribute a great deal tothe discussion.a third reason for a continuing dialogue on informationtechnology and the research university is that the activity canserve as an ongoing mechanism to track technological changesand their implications for universities. individual institutionswould be unlikely to do this systematically on their own.what would the continued dialogue consist of, and whatcould it accomplish? one model for the national academiesactivity is the stresses on research and education at collegesand universities project that was undertaken during the 1990sby the national science board and the governmentuniversityindustry research roundtable (nsbguirr, 1994 and 1998;preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution52texas a&m university, 1994). this effort consisted of severalnational colloquia and linked campusbased dialogues to exploreand address the new stresses on universitybased research thatappeared in the early 1990s.campus dialogues will be an important grassrootslevelcomponent of the new activity. for example, participating institutions will organize structured dialogues to bring togetherfaculty, students, and administrators to discuss challenges andopportunities presented by digital technology and formulatepossible responses. serving as precedent is the stresses project,in which several of its campus dialogues unexpectedly catalyzedlongerterm strategic planning and change exercises at the participating institutions (texas a&m university, 1994). in thisnew activity, therefore, building an infrastructure for continuedcampus dialogue and change will be consciously built into itsown exercises.periodic national conferences and workshops will beemployed for proposing strategies. standing subgroups mightbe formed to develop followup strategies and actions (including possible alliances). in addition, the internet will be used tofacilitate the dialogues themselves (through the provision ofcollaborative space on the projects web site) and to encourageregular exchange among the participating institutions and thebroader public.additional dialogues will be organized among institutionalleaders, such as deans, university trustees, and top faculty, andlinks will be forged with state and national policy makers andindustry leaders. the panel believes that the policy dimension iscrucial, although it also believes that public discussions andthinking have not advanced to the point where specific policyissues could be addressed in this present report.24such sustained activity would be aimed at producing specificinitiatives and demonstration projects to help research universities develop appropriate strategies for the digital age. examplesinclude the use of veryhighbandwidth networks (e.g., internet2)to support new activities such as multicasting and telepresence,novel approaches to using technology to enhance teaching andlearning, and innovative approaches to sustainable financing ofinformationtechnology infrastructure.as a result of this threeyear project, we expect that theintellectual community studying issues related to informationtechnology and the research university will be enlarged andpreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.choosing the future: findings and options53strengthened; dialogue across institutions, disciplines, and functions will be enhanced; governmental leaders and key foundations will be engaged; and new approaches to change at thecampus and national levels will be taking shape.breathtaking implicationsthere is little doubt that the status quo in higher educationcannot, and should not, be maintained as this disruptive digitaltechnology finds its way into every corner of our society, and inever more significant ways. yet while the challenges to theresearch university will be great, so too will be the potential toenhance the important social role of this institution.academics should approach issues and decisions on information technology in that spiritnot as threats but as opportunities. creative, visionary leaders can respond by guiding theirinstitutions in new directions that reinforce and augment theirmost critical roles and values. they can use information technology to help their students learn more successfully, theirfaculty members become better scholars and teachers, and theirinstitutions serve society inclusively and to ever greater effect.we are on the threshold of a revolution that is making theworlds accumulated information and knowledge accessible toindividuals everywhere. it has breathtaking implications for usall, but the challenge is particularly great for the academiccommunity. our missionour responsibilityis to develop astrategic framework that enables us to understand this extraordinary technology and shape its impact with skill and imagination. if we are successful, the research university can remain amajor source of sustenance for a free and spirited democracy, avibrant intellectual life, a healthy economy, and other nationalvalues.¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥preparing for the revolution: information technology and the

a web site thatdebunks urban legends, illustrates how the internet can aid in establishing theaccuracy or inaccuracy of information. in the academic world, informationtechnology tools have been developed to facilitate and thwart plagiarism(foster, 2002).2.this is not to imply that institutions and their faculty do not currentlyvalue learning. still, at research universities the relative importance put onresearch and publishing in tenure decisions is significant, and anecdotalevidence indicates that the emphasis on research may be growing (wilson,2001). nevertheless, the potential for change is illustrated by the emergenceof courses in which students from several institutions in different parts of theworld learn collaboratively (cogburn, levinson, atkins, and wielbut, 2001).3.university researchers in a range of fields have been, and continue to be,òlead usersó of new technology (benner, 2001); the internet, for example,first emerged as a research application of information technology. similarly,computer networks are used to enhance librariesõ intellectual resources,simulate physical phenomena, and link researchers worldwide in virtuallaboratories, or òcollaboratoriesóñadvanced, distributed infrastructures thatuse multimedia networks to relax the constraints on distance, time, and evenreality (kiernan, 1999; national research council, 1993 and 2001; nationalscience board, 2000). in addition, university management and administrativeprocesses have become heavily dependent on information technology.4.there are many uncertainties about whether and how online studentslearn differently from facetoface students (koch, 1998).5.studentsõ greater responsibility and control may be a mixed blessing.for example, under certain conditions online learning may lead to a greateremphasis on the productñthe diplomañas opposed to the educationprocess (lerych, 2001).chapter 26.at the time this report went to press, an illustrative chart could be

indicates that transpacificbandwidth capability increased from 14 gigabits to 244 gigabits per second bythe end of 2000, with transatlantic capability at about 550 gigabits persecond, and u.s.latin american bandwidth capability at about 290 gigabitsper second. bear in mind, however, that this is all backbone cable, and notwhat anyone could dial into.9.the july 2001 survey by the internet

change, including advances in information technology.11.for example, the ims global learning consortium is developing andpromoting open specifications for facilitating online distributedlearningactivities such as locating and using educational content, tracking learnerprogress, reporting learner performance, and exchanging student recordsbetween administrative systems (www.imsproject.org). the advanceddistributed learning initiative is a universityindustrygovernment effortlaunched by the department of defense in 1997 to develop elearningstandardization (www.adlnet.org).12.the discussion at the january 2223, 2001 workshop on the impacts ofinformation technology on the future of the research university(www.researchchannel.com) includes perspectives from several experts.13.another cohort of learners pushing for change is employed adults.14.in this area, information technology can help institutions and facultymove in a direction that they are already exploring. (king, 1993; grasha,1994)15.at some institutions, the distinction between adult learners and oncampus students is becoming increasingly blurred as more fulltime studentsblend facetoface and online coursework in order to balance work, family,and academic obligations.16.see pethokoukis (2002) who cites proprietary reports from internationaldata corp. and bear stearns.17.see www.blackboard.com and www.webct.com.18.unext is an education company that provides online business educationand other elearning products in collaboration with several universities(including stanford and columbia). courses include targeted training programs and professional development, as well as business education. unextpreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.endnotes57operates an accredited online university, cardean university, that offersbusinessrelated courses and an mba degree.19.an example of such a portal is stanfordõs highwire press(highwire.stanford.edu).20.michael mcrobbie (2001), indiana universityõs chief information officer,notes that he operates with a $100 million annual budget and is implementinga $200 million fiveyear strategic plan for it.21.the university of phoenix (www.phoenix.edu) is a private, forprofitentity that provides highquality education to working adult students.through innovative avenues such as distanceeducation technologies, theuniversity is accessible to working adults regardless of their geographicallocation. it has 107 campuses in the united states and canada.22.jones international university (www.jonesinternational.edu) is a completely online university that offers undergraduate and graduate degrees aswell as certificate programs. started in 1995, it was accredited in 1999 by thehigher learning commission, a member of the north central association.chapter 423.but the halflife of studentsõ basic technology is diminishing as technologicalchange accelerates. for twenty years or more the entering college freshmanbought and used a typewriter. in the late 1980s and early 1990s it was apersonal computer. in the mid1990s email usage grew. the late 1990s sawthe advent of the world wide web and napster. currently, instantmessaging is the òhotó technology.24.other groups are examining policy issues related to the future ofresearch universities. for example, in 2000 the kellogg commission on thefuture of state and landgrant universities proposed a òmillenium partnership initiativeóña renewed òpartnership of federal and state government,colleges and universities, and the private sector to build the technologyinfrastructure needed to educate and train the twentyfirst centuryworkforce.ópreparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.preparing for the revolution: information technology and the future of the research universitycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.references59attali, jacques. 1992. millennium: winners and losers in the coming world order.new york: times books.barua, anitesh, pinnell, jon, shutter, jay and andrew b. whinston. 1999.òmeasuring the internet economy: an exploratory study.ó austin, texas:center for research in internet commerce, school of business administration, university of texas at austin.
