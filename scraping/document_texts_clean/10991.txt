programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.viiprefacein september 2002, the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) requested the assistance ofthe national research council (nrc) in providing expertise to assist it in its review of thetrilogy information technology (it) modernization program. in response, the nrc conveneda number of experts who met with the fbi. the fbi briefed these experts on various aspects ofthe program, and these experts responded to the fbi as individuals to those briefings. (inhindsight, many of these individually provided comments presaged the more formal findingsand conclusions presented in this report.)in july 2003, the fbi again requested the assistance of the nrc on the same topic, afterhaving made progress in its it modernization efforts. the committeeõs charge was to providea more thorough review and set of recommendations on the fbiõs information technologymodernization efforts, focusing primarily on the trilogy program but addressing related issuesas necessary.in this second request, the fbi asked for a written report, thus invoking the regular nrcreport process. to minimize the time needed to respond to the fbi, the computer science andtelecommunications board (cstb) of the nrc selected a committee composed largely but notexclusively of the experts convened for the september 2002 meeting.the committeeõs charge was to review the fbiõs efforts on the trilogy it modernizationprogram, based on input provided to the committee by the fbi. the fbi also requested areview that could be done quickly and relatively inexpensively. accordingly, the committeedid not systematically develop information from nonfbi sources, nor did it undertake acomprehensive review of all fbi it systems or plans for such systems. furthermore, thecommittee was only able to sample the programs of interest, and thus it did not achieve acomprehensive picture even of those programs. except as explicitly noted otherwise, thebriefings to the committee on october 2728, 2003, and december 1516, 2003, constitute thefactual base for this effort. the committeeõs conclusions and recommendations reflect itscollective experience with largescale it system deployments.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization

messagealthough the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) has made significant progress in itsinformation technology (it) modernization program in the last year or so, the committeebelieves that the fbiõs it modernization program is not currently on a path to success. to geton that path, the committee recommends several key changes.first, foremost, and most critical in light of the impending rollout of the virtual case file(vcf) application, the fbi should not proceed with deployment of the vcf until it has avalidated contingency plan for reverting completely or partially to the automated casesupport (acs) system, if necessary, together with clear and measurable criteria to determinewhen the acs can safely be turned off. in the absence of a validated contingency plan, the fbiruns a very high risk that its planned òflash cutoveró from the old acs system to the vcf willcause missiondisruptive failures and further delays. this issue is a consequence of the factthat the vcf has been developed without the benefit of prototyping, with the result that thevcf application will not have been tested in an operational context.second, the success of the fbiõs information technology efforts will require the development of a close linkage between it and a coherent view of the bureauõs mission and operational needs. the development of this strategic linkageñthe enterprise architectureñcannotbe delegated inside the bureau to the chief information officer (cio) or outside to contractors.only the senior leadership of the fbi can establish the policies, define the operational frameworks and priorities, and make the tradeoffs that are necessary to formulate this strategicview. to do so, they must be deeply and directly involved in its creation.third, because testing is such a critical dimension of system development and deployment, the fbi must allow adequate time for testing before any it application (including thevcf) is deployed, even if dates of initial operational capability are delayed. testing mustinclude a full systems integration test and adequate scale, volume, and stress tests.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.2a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programfourth, the fbiõs contract management process is inadequate, and contract schedules lackthe specificity necessary to determine whether a project is making adequate progress withinschedule and budget constraints. this weakness can be remedied through the aggressive useof standard contract and project management tools.finally, while the fbiõs it team includes a number of very capable individuals, the overallhuman resource base for it is not nearly adequate to meet the challenges it faces. for trilogyand subsequent it projects to have access to the human talent they need to succeed, the fbimust dramatically grow its own internal expertise in it and it contract management as quicklyas possible.backgroundthe fbiõs trilogy it modernization program is intended to upgrade the it infrastructureof the fbi by providing a highspeed network linking the offices of the fbi, modern workstations and software within each office for every fbi employee, and a user application knownas the virtual case file to enhance the ability of agents to organize, access, and analyzeinformation. however, the trilogy programõs development and implementation have beentroubled. the trilogy program has been the subject of a number of general accounting office(gao) and department of justice (doj) inspector general investigations, as well as a source ofconsiderable concern to the u.s. congress. in july 2003, the fbi requested the assistance of thenational research council (nrc) to review the trilogy program and the progress that hadbeen made, and further to consider other nascent it efforts to support the bureauõs newpriorities in counterterrorism.in response to this request, the nrc convened the committee on the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization program, consisting of experts with considerable experience in largescale it deployments. the committee met twice in 2day sessions to receivebriefings from the fbi about trilogy and other related matters, and except as explicitly notedotherwise, those briefings constitute the factual base for this effort.the situation todayin the wake of the events of september 11, 2001, the fbi is undergoing a significant expansion of its mission responsibilities and a reordering of its priorities to emphasize its counterterrorist mission, though it still retains its very important criminal investigation mission. thefbi recognizes very well that it will become ever more dependent on information technologyin the future to manage the large quantities of information associated with these missions.it is challenging for any organization engaged in a complex set of activities to introducenew technologies and to reengineer its key processes to exploit them effectively. it is doublychallenging, as it is for the fbi, to do so when under intense operational pressuresñthe fbiõstraditional work must continue while new technology is introduced and while a culture moreadapted to the use of it is evolved. and it is triply so for the fbi in the face of the added strainof its new focusñpreventive counterterrorismñin which mission success demands a differentmindset, different operational skills, and the exploitation of an expanded set of informationsources.the fbi has made significant progress in certain areas of its it modernization program inthe last year or so. for example, it has achieved the modernization of the computing hardwarea review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.executive summary3and baseline software on the desktops of agents and other personnel, and has taken majorstrides forward in the deployment of its networking infrastructure. nevertheless, as thisreport documents, the committee believes that the fbiõs it modernization program is notcurrently on a path to success. the committeeõs review of the approach and methodologybeing used by the fbi has identified significant issues in four major areas: enterprise architecture, system design, program and contract management, and human resources.issuesenterprise architectureas in any organization, private sector or government, the operational needs of the fbimust be the driver of its information technology investments. if it is to be successful in itsefforts to exploit it, the fbi must first and as a matter of its highest priority in its it effortsformulate an enterprise architecture. such an architecture is necessary to provide a strategicview of its mission and operational needs, and would begin with a detailed characterization ofthe bureauõs goals, tasks, strategies, and key operational processes. this view links operational objectives and processes to it strategy and will allow the fbi to specify how investmentis tied to the achievement of operational objectives.based on presentations to the committee by the fbi (as well as a review of certain documents produced by the fbi, gao, and doj), the committee has concluded that the fbiõsefforts and results in the area of enterprise architecture are late and limited, and fall far shortof what is required. the committee was encouraged by early efforts driven by the recentlyappointed executive assistant director of intelligence to develop a concept of operations of theintelligence process from which appropriate it systems support can be architected and designed.however and overall, the fbiõs senior leadership is insufficiently engaged in the developmentof the enterprise architecture, with the result that this development task is delegated in largepart to outside contractors and to a cio. though these parties are essential players, only thesenior leadership of the fbi can establish the key policies, set the operational priorities, andmake the significant tradeoffs that must be reflected in the complete enterprise architectureand it system design. among the most important decisions to be made are the risk tradeoffsinvolved in ensuring sufficiently broad controlled access to sensitive information. such decisions must be made at the level of the senior leadership.system designalthough the committee recognizes that the bureau has made significant progress on thevirtual case file in the last year or so, it has concerns about the vcf and the integrated datawarehouse.the vcf has many positive attributes. based on a canned demonstration of a vcf mockup, the committee believes that the vcf should significantly enhance the information management capabilities of fbi agents in their investigative role. however, the bureauwide rolloutof this application is months delayed from its originally scheduled deployment in december2003. going forward, the committee has a number of concerns about the vcf.first, the fbi described to the committee a plan for a òflash cutoveró from the old automated case support system to the vcf, rather than a limited initial rollout that would shakea review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.4a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programout problems in an operational context. the committeeõs concerns in this area are heightenedby the fact that in the interests of rapid deployment, the current vcf schedule appears to givelittle consideration to testing and presumes success at every stageña highly risky approach.the current choice facing the fbi on this matter of scheduling is between (a)delaying vcfdeployment so that adequate testing can be completed, and (b) forcing operational users to dothe testing themselves after implementation, with all of the potential negative consequencesthat such an approach can produce. the current plan is likely to result in (b).with limited testing, and no experience gained from a limited initial rollout, the fbi wouldbe implementing what amounts to a prototype throughout the bureau. this approach isnearly guaranteed to cause missioncritical failures and further delays, with implications fortraining, performance, coherence, internal morale, public image, and cost to recovery.second, the vcf was designed to support the investigative mandate of the fbi. the designprocess was well under way prior to the expansion of the intelligence mission, and the requirements for the processes supporting the intelligence mission were not included in the vcfdesign. for this reason, and because of the significant differences in it requirements betweensystems supporting investigation and those supporting intelligence, the committee stronglyrecommends that the fbi refrain from using the vcf as the foundation on which to build itsanalytical and data management capabilities for the intelligence processes supporting thecounterterrorism mission. rather, the fbi should conceptualize an architecture for the counterterrorism mission from scratch, and then design explicit interfaces to the vcf when information must flow between them.another application, still in the design stage, the integrated data warehouse (idw), alsoseems to suffer from a lack of deep consideration of how and what sources of data are used bydifferent operational elements and in different processes of the fbi. for example, presentations to the committee suggested a mismatch between the expectation that intelligence analysts would have access to live databases containing the most current information and thereality of what the idw as designed would actually provide. that is, the idw would provideonly the latest copies of production databases, replacing old copies of data with newer copies.thus, data could be there one day and not the next, since the idw apparently was not designedto retain older or historical data. while having only the most recent copy of data may beappropriate for the purposes of an investigation (presuming the most recent copy is the mostaccurate and reliable), this process may not serve intelligence purposes very well.program and contract managementthe committee has serious concerns about the approaches and processes used by the fbi todevelop and field both it infrastructure and applications.in the committeeõs view, a major weakness is that the fbi does not appear to employ uservetted prototypes in its applications development process. in practice, it is essentially impossible for even the most operationally experienced it applications developers to be able toanticipate in detail and in advance all of the requirements and specifications. therefore,internal development plans, and the development contracts with supporting organizations,should call for an approach that is based on a process of extensive prototyping and usabilitytesting with real users. doing so allows iterative development with strong user feedback andinvolvement, thus increasing the chances that what is ultimately delivered to the end usersmeets their needs. this point is relevant to many dimensions of system development, includa review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.executive summary5ing the functionality desired in a new application, the convenience and intuitiveness of a userinterface, and the nature, scale, and mix of the data entry, management, and retrieval load thatthe networks and systems must support under real operational conditions.the committee believes that both contract management and program management needsubstantial improvement. for example, while task orders viewed by the committee detailedpricing to eight or nine significant figures, the corresponding contract schedules were almosttotally lacking in specifications, deliverables, and commitment to checkpoints. under thesecircumstances, effective program and contract management is essentially impossible. currentcontracting and management problems, aggravated by frequent turnover among key fbi staff,make it unsurprising that trilogy is significantly behind schedule and over budget.furthermore, the fbi appears overly dependent on outside contractors to undertake essential tasks, such as identifying key operational processes, defining the fbiõs it concept ofoperations, and making decisions about the major tradeoffs that are inevitably required. whileoutside contractors play important roles, it is the senior fbi management who must lead inassuming responsibility for these tasks.human resources and external constraintsalthough the committee did not undertake a comprehensive assessment in the humanresources area, presentations to the committee persuaded it that with a few exceptions, the fbilacks a human resource and skill base adequate to deal with the bureauõs it modernizationprogram. specifically, the fbi is extremely short on experienced program managers andcontract managers and senior it management team members with good communicationsskills. at the same time, the fbi appears to have the authority to hire highly qualified itpersonnel without requiring them to make excessive financial sacrifices, and to borrow personnel from other agencies and even from the private sector. the committee is encouraged tolearn that an acting chief information officer was put into place at the beginning of 2004.of lesser concern, but in the committeeõs view still worth noting, is the fact that the fbi alsooperates under a number of external constraints that diminish its management flexibility. forexample, it is the committeeõs understanding that the fbi is unable to take actions such asreprogramming amounts in excess of $500,000 without explicit congressional approval. thisconstraint is inconsistent with the expectation that the fbi will move quickly and forcefully toreshape itself to deal effectively with new challenges.recommendationsthe first and most urgent recommendation, indeed critical in light of the impending vcfsystem rollout, is that the fbi not proceed with deployment of the vcf until it has a validatedcontingency plan for reverting completely or partially to the acs, if necessary, and clear andmeasurable criteria to determine when the acs can safely be turned off. beyond this criticalrecommendation, the committee makes a number of recommendations, grouped into fourareas, that will significantly increase the likelihood of success in and drive an accelerated pacefor the fbiõs it modernization efforts. the most important of these recommendations aredescribed below, and they are, in the committeeõs judgment, imperatives for the success of thefbiõs it modernization program.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.6a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programin the area of enterprise architecture, the development of a complete enterprise architecture is central to the fbiõs it efforts. the most important recommendations in this area (othersare presented in the main text) are the following:¥if the fbiõs it modernization program is to succeed, the fbiõs top leadership, includingthe director, must make the creation and communication of a complete enterprise architecturea top priority. this means that they must be personally involved and invested in the keydecisions that the process will require be made, such as the tradeoffs between the security ofand access to information in the various data sources that are used in criminal investigationand counterterrorism efforts. while a contractor might well assist the fbi in developing theenterprise architecture, no contractor will fully understand the operational issues that must bereflected in the enterprise architecture, nor be empowered to make decisions about how tomake the tradeoffs with competing concerns. a small team, consisting primarily of senioroperational managers from the criminal investigation division, the office of intelligence, andthe counterterrorism division, and a senior it executive to translate what these managers sayinto architectural terms, should be able to develop the broad outlines of the operational aspectsof the enterprise architecture as well as a toplevel schematic view of the systems design in amatter of 4 to 6 months of fulltime work. to decide on the many operational and policytradeoffs that will inevitably arise, this team must have direct access to and the frequentinvolvement of the most senior management of the fbi, including the director and the deputydirector.¥the fbi should seek independent and regular review of its enterprise architecture as itdevelops by an external panel of experts with experience in both operations and technology/architecture. when the first draft of the enterprise architecture has been prepared, it should bereviewed by an external panel of independent experts charged with helping the fbi to improvehow it uses it in the long term.¥given that the counterterrorism mission requires extensive information sharing, the fbishould seek input on and comment from other intelligence agencies regarding its enterprisearchitecture effort. the reason is that the fbiõs information systems must have interfaces tothose agencies to ensure that the information resources of those agencies are appropriatelylinked to fbi systems so that those agencies are able to work collaboratively.in the area of system design, the most important recommendations (others are presentedin the main text) are the following:¥the fbi should refrain from initiating, developing, or deploying any it applicationother than the vcf until a complete enterprise architecture is in place.¥the fbi should develop a process map for information sharing that clearly defines thecurrent state of and a desired end state for the informationsharing process so that the numerous informationsharing initiatives can be coordinated and properly monitored and managed.¥the fbi should immediately develop plans that address recovery of data and functionality in the event that essential technology services come under denialofservice attacks (e.g.,from viruses and pervasively replicated software bugs).in the area of program and contract management, the most important recommendations(others are presented in the main text) are the following:a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.executive summary7¥because testing is such a critical dimension of system development and deployment, thefbi must allow adequate time for testing before any it application (including the vcf) isdeployed, even if dates of initial operational capability are delayed. testing must include afull systems integration test and adequate scale, volume, and stress tests.¥in future it applications development, particularly of largescale enduserorientedapplications, procurement contracts should be conditioned on the development of smallscaleprototypes that can be built rapidly and tested with user feedback before committing to largescale development.¥for it applications beyond the vcf, the fbi should exploit proven methodologies ofcontracting and contract management, including the use of detailed functional specifications,specific milestones, frequent contract reviews, and earnedvalue metrics.in the area of human resources, the most important recommendations (others are presented in the main text) are the following:¥for trilogy and subsequent it projects to have access to the human talent they need tosucceed, the fbi must dramatically grow its own internal expertise in it and it contractmanagement as quickly as possible. in the short term, this effort will almost certainly involveborrowing experienced and capable contract managers from other agencies. in the long run,establishing its own internal it expertise will involve the creation of longterm highstatuscareer tracks with the fbi for it personnel.¥because of their importance to the short and longterm success of the bureauõs itmodernization efforts, the fbi must permanently fill the positions of chief information officerand chief enterprise architect, and the committee concurs with the directorõs judgment thatfilling these positions with appropriately qualified individuals ought to have the highestpriority.¥the fbi should develop an improved system for internally reviewing the state of progressin key it programs and for communicating relevant findings to key stakeholders, thus preempting the perceived need for and distraction of constant external investigations.the committee believes that the fbi has made significant progress in some areas of its itmodernization efforts, such as the modernization of the computing hardware and baselinesoftware and the deployment of its networking infrastructure. however, because the fbi itinfrastructure was so inadequate in the past, there is still an enormous gap between the fbiõscurrent it capabilities and the capabilities that are urgently needed.some useful and valuable returns from the investment in the trilogy program appear to bewithin reach. nevertheless, the committee believes that a major effort is needed to bring thefbi to the state where it can be characterized as an effective exploiter of information technology. the committee has made recommendations that, if adopted, will significantly increase the likelihood that the fbiõs trilogy it modernization program will enhance the fbiõseffectiveness in carrying out its crimefighting and counterterrorism missions. but it emphasizes the difference between a pro forma adoption of these recommendations and an adoptionof these recommendations that is both fully embraced throughout the agency and aggressivelyexecuted. the former may be the metric that auditing and oversight agencies and offices oftenuse in assessing agency performance, but it is the attitude and willingness of senior staff to actthat really count. the senior management of the fbi has a substantive and direct role

the it process will yield major enhancements to mission achievement as well as substantial operational efficiencies.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.91backgroundthe federal bureau of investigation (fbi) is undergoing a significant shift of its missionresponsibilities and a reordering of its priorities. for most of its history, the fbi has beenoriented primarily toward law enforcement and the investigation of criminal activities. however, in the wake of the attacks of september 11, 2001, the threat environment has changeddramatically, and the fbiõs mission has expanded to include as its top priority the detection ofpotential terrorism against the u.s. homeland and the interdiction of terrorist activities beforethey cause damage. although the leadership of the fbi recognizes the need for upgradedinformation technology (it) to enhance its ability to collect, store, search, retrieve, analyze,and share information in pursuit of its missions, the fbi has not been regarded as a sophisticated user of it. indeed, for many years, the fbi has been criticized for inadequate attentionand competence with respect to its use of it.for any organization engaged in a complex set of activities, the introduction of modern itand the concomitant reengineering of the organizationõs key processes to fully exploit thetechnology constitute a major challenge. in the fbiõs case, this transformation is being managed under intense operational pressures: the fbiõs traditional work must continue even asnew technology is introduced and a culture more comfortable with it is evolved. compounding this challenge is the added strain of the new focus on preventive counterterrorism, wheresuccess demands a different mindset, different operational skills, and the exploitation of aradically expanded set of information sources.the fbi has made significant progress in certain areas of its it modernization program inthe last year or so. for example, it has achieved the modernization of the computing hardwareand baseline software on the desktops of agents and other personnel and has taken majorstrides forward in the deployment of its networking infrastructure. nevertheless, in a numberof key areas, the fbiõs progress has fallen significantly short of what it, and the nation, require.organizations should invest in it only if such investment will improve their operationaleffectiveness. therefore, the return on an it investment must be measured in operationala review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.10a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programtermsñmore and better results, increased responsiveness and agility, and improved efficiencyof operations. maximizing the return on a major it investment thus requires an intimate anddynamic interplay between the technology and an organizationõs operational strategy, and sothis report begins its discussion from the operational and strategy side.1.1preliminariesinformation technology most effectively facilitates the òbusinessó and òoperationsó oforganizations when it is explicitly designed to do so, whether the organizations are profitandloss enterprises, notforprofit private organizations, or government agencies. such designrequires careful specification of objectives, strategies for achieving objectives, and the processesby which strategies are realized. effective management also requires that a set of measures ofsuccess be defined and tracked, using both outcome and process metrics. this report makesfrequent use of the term òoperational processesó to refer to the processes used within the fbito accomplish its missions. (some might prefer the term òbusiness processesó; the meaning isthe same.)the committee views the fbi as being engaged in a number of important operationalpursuits that are tantamount to enterprise business objectives, even though those operationalpursuits do not have profitmaking goals. thus, the fbi should engage in costeffectivenessanalyses corresponding to costbenefit analyses in commercial enterprises that will aim toincrease the return in improved operational effectiveness and efficiency that u.s. taxpayersrightly expect for bureau expenditures.in general, organizations must develop their own metrics to quantify their objectives.among the purposes of doing so are to be able to determine the extent to which a giveninvestment will help an organization better achieve those objectives, and to retrospectivelytrack the returns on such investments. the committee recognizes that the ultimate goal of thefbi is the prevention of undesirable events, and in this context, meaningful quantification ofthat goal can be problematic. nevertheless, it is desirable and almost always possible toestablish reasonable intermediate quantifiable objectives that bear on operational efficiency,subject to the understanding that these measures reflect the underlying processes and do notbecome goals in and of themselves.the committee believes that many management approaches, tools, and best practices fromthe commercial sector are applicable to the fbi, just as they are to the department of defenseand other government enterprises. many of the observations and recommendations in thisreport are the result of the committeeõs assessment of the fbiõs current approach comparedwith successful approaches seen by committee members in both the forprofit and the notforprofit sectors.1.2missions of the fbithe nature of an organizationõs missions and its strategy and operational objectives are theprimary drivers of the kinds of information and communication it needs and the processes it mustexploit. these needs in turn determine the architecture, design, and functioning of its it systems.according to the fbi, its mission is òto uphold the law through the investigation of violations of federal criminal law; to protect the united states from foreign intelligence and terroristactivities; to provide leadership and law enforcement assistance to federal, state, local, anda review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.background11international agencies; and to perform these responsibilities in a manner that is responsive tothe needs of the public and is faithful to the constitution of the united states.ó1 the first twoelements are highly operational: the investigation of criminal activity to support the prosecution of criminals (òcriminal investigationó for short in this report) and the prevention ofterrorism within the united states and against u.s. interests around the world (òcounterterrorismó in this report). supporting these missions and the achievement of the relatedoperational objectives of these mission segments is a set of key processes that are used todifferent degrees in achieving the objectives.1.2.1criminal investigationthe traditional mission of the fbi is that of an investigative agency for the department ofjustice of the united states. this mission is focused on investigating and preparing much ofthe information basis for the prosecution of crimes. the information developed by fbi investigators is provided to prosecutors who in turn determine if an individual will be prosecuted.the fbi can initiate a criminal investigation when facts or circumstances reasonably indicatethat a federal crime has been, is being, or will be committed, and the investigation may beconducted to prevent, solve, and prosecute such criminal activity.2 as a practical matter, mostinvestigations are reactiveñthat is, they are initiated in response to a specific occurrence ofcriminal activity. (note that the standard for òreasonable indicationó is substantially lowerthan that for probable cause.) once the fbi investigative activity has been initiated, the fbiwill use the resources legally at its disposal to gather relevant information related to thesituation.in those instances where a criminal act may be committed in the future, preparation forthat act can be a current criminal violation under the conspiracy or attempt provisions offederal criminal law or other provisions defining preparatory crimes, such as solicitation of acrime of violence or provision of material support in preparation for a terrorist crime. thestandard for opening an investigation is satisfied where there is not yet a current substantiveor preparatory crime, but facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that such a crime willoccur in the future.31.2.2counterterrorismin the counterterrorism domain, the fbiõs objective is to prevent acts of terrorism in theunited states and against u.s. persons and interests throughout the world. accomplishingthis daunting objective requires, among many other activities, accessing, analyzing, and1see http://www.fbi.gov/priorities/priorities.htm.2a step short of a fullfledged investigation is known as a preliminary inquiry, which is a step taken when the fbi receivesinformation or an allegation not warranting a full investigationñbecause there is not yet a òreasonable indicationó of criminalactivitiesñbut whose responsible handling requires some further scrutiny beyond the prompt and limited checking out of initialleads. such an inquiry is intended to allow the government to respond in a measured way to ambiguous or incomplete information, with as little intrusion as the needs of the situation permit. this measured response is especially important when anallegation or information is received from a source of unknown reliability. a preliminary inquiry is intended to establishwhether or not a fullfledged investigation is warranted.3information on investigations and inquiries is derived from the attorney generalõs guidelines on general crimes, racketeeringenterprise and terrorism enterprise investigations, available at http:// www.usdoj.gov/olp/generalcrimes2.pdf.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.12a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programexchanging massive amounts of information, and close, daily coordination and cooperationamong law enforcement, intelligence, and many other involved organizations.4in this area, the role of the fbi is proactive and ongoing, and the execution of its mission isnot necessarily carried out in response to any particular external event. (if a serious terroristevent has already occurred, then it is reasonable to suggest that the execution of the counterterrorism mission has not been fully successful.) there is some overlap of activities betweenthe criminal investigation and counterterrorism missions, as discussed below, but the newemphasis on counterterrorism requires a different mindset among some fbi staff, some newor different operational processes, and new requirements for supporting it systems.1.3key fbi processesit is important to distinguish between missions and the key processes that support theaccomplishment of those missions. in some cases, a key process supports only one mission; inothers, a key process may support more than one mission. the key processes used by the fbiinvolve, among other things, information acquisition and the workflow of information managementñhow information is acquired, who must act on it, how information of all types flowswithin the organization, how it must be processed and analyzed, and what types of inferencesmust be drawn. for informationintensive missions such as criminal investigation and counterterrorism, modern it and its proper design and exploitation are critical contributors to trulyeffective processes.this section describes some of the key processes within the fbi. however, the readershould keep in mind that the terminology used here reflects processes rather than organizational titles. that is, òinvestigation,ó òintelligence,ó and òinformation managementó are meantto refer to processes or functions rather than specific offices or divisions within the fbi.1.3.1 investigationthe investigative process is the primary process supporting the law enforcement mission.investigation develops information from a variety of sources, including but not limited toinformation gathered directly by special agents or other law enforcement agencies, information obtained through informants, information obtained from other agencies such as customsand border protection or local or foreign law enforcement agencies, laboratorydevelopedinformation, and publicly available information (e.g., information on the internet or in thenews). the collection and analysis of information are usually under the control of a specialagent leading and directly responsible for the investigation. the information (or derivatives,such as pointers to certain collected information) is placed in centralized fbi files for appropriate dissemination and use as part of the case file.the agent or group of agents assigned to a case is the focal point of fbi criminal and lawenforcement activities. the agent is responsible for carrying out the investigative task and4another dimension of the counterterrorism mission is the active insertion of sympathetic parties (ranging from those wholisten to those who take a more active role in disrupting) into hostile organizations such as terrorist cells. this type of activity isfar more controversial as it poses nontrivial challenges to the nationõs core values, and history demonstrates that such actions canhave significant political repercussions when they are undertaken within the united states. in any event, this report is deliberately silent on this dimension of the counterterrorism mission, as it is largely beyond the scope of the committeeõs charge.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.background13managing much of the information involved. in the case of a criminal investigation, theinformation developed is then conveyed to the prosecutor for decision and action. in the caseof a background investigation, the information is delivered to the requesting agency. theagent is the focal point of the activity with support from administrative staff, analysts, andother fbi employees. the investigative information is organized around cases, which serve asthe fundamental unit for information management. moreover, there are a variety of legal andprocedural requirements in place to ensure that developed information can be used in court tosupport prosecutorial activities.the fbi relies extensively on a welldeveloped remote tasking practice whereby an agentin one location who needs information from another area can easily transmit a request, calleda òlead,ó to the appropriate field office where it will be followed up by a local agent. thispractice is remarkable in that it allows the organization to function on a continental scalewithout a tremendous cost in time and money for travel or the overhead that would beinvolved if headquarters had to be directly involved. yet the process provides the personalcontact that is essential to productive interviewing by fbi agents of suspects or individualswith leads. for this practice to work as effectively as it manifestly does is a testimony to thequality of training and the uniformity of culture within the fbi. nevertheless, a thoughtfulapplication of technology can support and enrich this practice, and make it even more effectiveand efficient.1.3.2intelligenceintelligence processes include information collection and analytical functions. information gathered under intelligence auspices is frequently more tentative and expansive in scopeas compared with information collected under investigative auspices. rules on informationretention and use also differ in each domain. intelligence processes are used in both lawenforcement and counterterrorism missions, although the collection of information gatheredunder intelligence auspices is not directly aimed at the support of prosecutorial activities.intelligence in the counterterrorism context requires that voluminous information resourcesfrom internal and external sources be logically brought together and analyzed with the goal ofidentifying potential threats of, or precursors to, terrorist activity. the range of sources ofinformation that must be selectively probed and analyzed is enormous, and much of theinformation will be obtained not from governmentowned sources but from publicly availablesources, such as newspapers in foreign languages, or the internet.55to illustrate one problem, the name of an individual can be represented in multiple ways. a specific name can have differentvariants (e.g., with or without a middle name, nicknames, short forms, order of given and family names). an individual may beregularly identified with different name variants in different geographical locales (even within the same country). transliterations into western languages (e.g., of arabic, chinese, or cyrillic into roman alphabets) add another layer of complexity. namestranscribed from voice (e.g., a wiretap) may be highly ambiguous in spelling. the original material from which the name wasobtained (fax, web, email, and so on) may be rendered in a multitude of computer encodings. search engines used for intelligence purposes must be able to reconcile all of these different encodings of a name when an analyst is searching on a given namefor references to a given individual. when the committee asked the fbi about this issue during briefings, the reply received was,òwe intend to use unicode to represent names.ó unicode representations deal with part of the problem (the part dealing withthe ability to represent a name in its native alphabet), but not the other parts of the problem. note that these issues also arise incriminal investigations, but to the extent that investigations relate to crimes committed by people in the united states, issuesrelated to names rendered in nonnative alphabets arise with much lower frequency.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.14a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programanalytical functions in the intelligence process must analyze information of uncertainrelevance and quality. the desired result is the distillation of conclusions that become increasingly certain as they are further aggregated and refined. such analyses may, at differentstages, result in warnings and may initiate deeper and more focused investigations that mayeventually lead to prosecutions.the intelligence process generally requires that the fbi receive information from anddisseminate information to local law enforcement agencies, the u.s. intelligence community,and often agencies of foreign nations. the ability to share information at multiple levels ofsecurity classification with a wide variety of collaborators is essential to the underlying intelligence process and to performance of the counterterrorism mission. information sharingmust generally proceed with much more caution in counterterrorism efforts than in mostcriminal investigations because of the sensitivity of information sources. yet strong capabilitiesto access, manage, analyze, and communicate information across institutional boundaries arekey to the analytical function at the core of the intelligence process.sharing information requires cooperative relationships with the intelligence and law enforcement communities across jurisdictional levels from local to international. furthermore, itssuccess demands a framework of policy and process to ensure appropriate balance amongtimely access, security, and privacy rights. trained analysts probe, tease apart, and developnew information that can identify, confirm, or exclude a hypothesis or a threat. it shouldserve to facilitate mutually cooperative relationships and analytical activities.in the law enforcement mission, special agents are in the lead, and analysts supportingthose agents must understand the investigative role of the bureau and the agentõs operationalprocesses. in the counterterrorism mission, analysts are primary, and the agents supportingthose analysts must understand that the primary role of analysts in counterterrorism is analogous to the role that agents play in pursuing the law enforcement mission. (for example,according to the fbiõs office of intelligence, special agents constitute one of the best collectionmechanisms available to the intelligence community for counterterrorism work.)most analysts have specialized expertise but must be able to easily cooperate with colleagues on diverse topics. an individual analyst at the fbi must be highly skilled in themethods and processes that are used for both the criminal and the counterterrorism missions.analysts must be comfortable with the it that provides the means of access to raw informationand underlies tools to support the distillation, sharing, and analysis processes.1.3.3information managementthe investigative and intelligence processes used by the fbi are informationintensive,and the bureau has recognized that stateoftheart information management that exploitsavailable technology can significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of these processes. furthermore, both counterterrorism and criminal investigation are evolving in a waythat spans traditional organizational boundaries in the fbi. special agents in charge (sacs)are organized around geography. terrorism and crime no longer respect those boundaries,and thus a bureauwide technology deployment necessarily entails a set of systems and datathat can be accessed easily across the geographic reach of the fbiõs missions. (the fbi encompasses 56 field offices in major cities in the united states, approximately 400 resident agencies(i.e., satellite offices in smaller cities and towns), and foreign posts in 52 nations.)a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.background156as used in this report, the term òplatformó refers to the computing infrastructure supporting fbi applications, specifically thecombination of a type of hardware, say a pccompatible personal computer, and specific software, such as a specific operatingsystem, web browser, and set of basic office applications.driven initially by the need for improved support of the investigative process, the fbi hasembarked on a major it modernization program, whose main focus today is the trilogyprogram. trilogy has two major objectives. the first is the creation of a more modern enduseroriented infrastructure, consisting of a secure widearea network and related local areanetworks, together with modern workstations, printers, scanners, and a base of commercialsoftware applications such as browsers. this infrastructure is intended to provide an enhancedplatform for modern applications.6 the second objective of trilogy is to provide enhancedsupport of the investigative process. this objective is the focus of the virtual case file (vcf)that will provide via a browser interface a userfriendly capability for agents to electronicallymanage caserelated information critical for criminal investigation.at this writing (late march 2004), neither the infrastructure deployment nor the vcfapplication is complete, although significant progress has been made on both. in addition tothe original two objectives, a general requirement to support the counterterrorism mission hasalso been placed on trilogy, although specifications for that novel task have not been fullydeveloped. the fbi has also embarked on the development and implementation of systems tosupport its intelligence functions, which are also important to the counterterrorism mission.central to this thrust is the creation of a large data repository, referred to as the idw, theintegrated data warehouse, also in its early stages.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.162itrelated issues for the fbirequiring immediate actionalthough limited in scope and time, the committeeõs review of the approach and methodologycurrently being used by the fbi to drive the introduction of its new it systems has raised anumber of significant issues. to address these issues requires concerted fbi action in fourmajor clusters. the issues in each of these clusters are serious in and of themselves. taken inaggregate, the detrimental impact of inattention to these issues on the fbiõs it modernizationefforts is enormous despite the progress that has been made. these four clusters are:¥enterprise architecture. an enterprise architecture maps the linkage between the fbiõsstrategy and operational needs and its it program.¥system design. system design is the engineering of detailed it solutions driven by theenterprise architecture.¥program and contract management. largescale program and contract management processesare critical to the success of it modernization endeavors as massive as trilogy.¥skills, resources, and external factors. the fourth and final cluster cuts across the first threeclusters and generally relates to human resources and skills, and to some of the externalconstraints faced by the fbi in its it modernization efforts.the next four sections deal with these issues cluster by cluster.2.1enterprise architecture issues2.1.1creating an enterprise architecture that serves fbi objectiveswhat is an enterprise architecture?an enterprise architecture characterizes the enterpriseõs missions, tasks, and operationalprocesses, and relates these tasks, processes, and operational objectives to it strategy, investa review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action17ment, and design. it provides substantial detail on the structure and standards used to implement the it system. the enterprise architecture is the framework that describes the way inwhich an organization such as the fbi conducts its mission(s), how it organizes and usestechnology to accomplish its goals and execute key operational processes, and how the itsystem is structured and designed in detail to achieve these objectives. in general, it shouldalso include documentation that explains the rationale behind important decisions and whycertain alternatives were chosen and others rejected.an enterprise architecture thus contains much more than information about technology.the enterprise architecture becomes the template on which the it investment is rationalized,and the enhancements to the fbiõs mission achievement, the return on the investment, aredefined and quantified using appropriate metrics. when new needs emerge, as with thecounterterrorism mission, an enterprise architecture provides a point of departureña framework within which additional capabilities can be coherently designed.absent an enterprise architecture, it is essentially impossible for any large organization,including the fbi, to make coherent or consistent operational or technical decisions about itinvestments. among these decisions are the definitions of appropriate data structures andlinkages to other systems and data sources, policies and methods of information sharing,issues of security and the tradeoffs with information access, innovation, and the exploitationof evolving technologies, and metrics of effectiveness for the it system and its use.the close link between good enterprise architecture planning and sound systems engineering practice on the one hand and success in largescale it deployments on the other hasbeen demonstrated in numerous examples in the private sector and in the federal government.1 further, the existence of the enterprise architecture can be a major contributor to theconfidence and trust that management, users, and implementers have in a project, as well asfacilitating cooperation among them. a welldocumented and communicated enterprise architecture is a prerequisite for driving cultural and operational change and innovation at a pacethat effectively capitalizes on the pace of technology improvement. good models depict theasis (todayõs) environment as well as the tobe (future desired) environment, showing thetransition.the structure of an enterprise architecturewhile technology capability is an important input to operational strategy, it is importantthat it investment not be driven primarily from the technology end, but rather that operational strategy drive technology investment and system design. to this end, the committeebelieves that a good starting point for achieving the required linkage is to think about architectures in three conceptually distinct but interrelated forms:21for an example in a medical setting, see jonathan m. teich et al., òthe brigham integrated computing system (bics):advanced clinical systems in an academic hospital environment,ó international journal of medical informatics 54: 197ð208 (1999).for a case study in which failure was closely associated with insufficient attention to architectural issues, see national researchcouncil, continued review of the tax systems modernization of the internal revenue service, computer science and telecommunications board,

2004, available at http://www.cio.com/archive/041504/wireless.html.2the architectural triad used here originates with the department of defense, which has used this framework to develop itscommand and control systems since 1997. (a good reference on this subject is architecture working group, department ofa review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.18a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization program¥an operational architecture, which describes in graphical and narrative terms the keyoperational objectives; the operational elements, tasks, and processes used to achieve them; ahighlevel description of the types of information used and created; how and with whatconstraints information of various types must be exchanged; and the information flows inthese processes. an operational architecture relates to specific mission scenarios and functionsand forms the basis for realistic process and information flow representation and prioritization.3 (an analogy for operational architecture in the construction domain is the concept ofoperations for the various purposes a building will serve, and how various components of thebuilding will serve those needs.)¥a systems architecture, which describes at a high level the data repositories, systems,applications, connectivity, and communications infrastructure that supports the operationalarchitecture for mission needs. the systems architecture defines the logical and physicalconnection, location, and identification of the key nodes, circuits, networks, and platforms thatare associated with information exchange and specifies some critical system performanceparameters. the systems architecture is constructed to satisfy operational architecture requirements using the standards defined in the technical architecture. (an analogy for systemsarchitecture in the construction domain is the blueprints for a building that illustrate howcomponents fit together.)¥a technical architecture, which captures the key technical standards, protocols, and specifications required to implement the systems architecture. a technical architecture is intendedto be a compact set of rules governing the arrangement, interaction, and interdependence ofthe parts or elements whose purpose is to ensure that a conforming system satisfies a specificset of requirements. it identifies system services, interfaces, standards, and their relationships.it provides the framework for the derivation of engineering specifications that guide theimplementation of systems. (an analogy for technical architecture in the construction domainis the set of building codes for connecting subsystems and ensuring the operational effectiveness of the building with the community electrical, water, sewage, and roadway systems.)to indicate what some of the content of these three architectures might be, the committeeattempts to describe in figure 1 some primary and supporting activities in the fbi as theymight contribute to one part of the architectural triad described aboveñan operational architecture.4 the purpose of figure 1 is to focus attention on key structural elements of the fbi.figure 2 shows a subset of fbi activities and the potential scope of planned supporting itdefense, c4isr architectural framework, version 2.0, december 18, 1997, available at http://www.defenselink.mil/nii/org/cio/i3/awgdigitallibrary/pdfdocs/fw.pdf. the descriptions of operational, systems, and technical architectures contained inthis report are adapted from this dod document.) note, however, that the engineering methodology of defining a òfunctionalarchitectureó based on processes and information flows and then building a òsystem architectureó with ever increasing technicaldetail dates back to the mid1970s. and the use of structured analysis to form the basis for a technical system design has been inwidespread use throughout commercial and government organizations since the late 1970s.3as one possible scenario, the fbi told the committee that it has some 6 million documents found in afghanistan. how will theinformation in these documents be extracted and managed? who will have access to what set of those documents? whatcircumstances will govern access rules? how will the information contained in these documents be used with other informationto which the fbi has access? thinking through this scenario will provide a great deal of insight into information managementrequirements. the key point is that however the fbi decides to handle the information from these documents, it should be ableto articulate the rationale for doing so in terms that make sense from an operational point of view.4see, for example, michael e. porter,

(acs and the scope prototype) and the ultimate nextgenerationapplications (vcf and idw 1.0) and their purpose in relation to the bureauõs core processes. clearly, the fbi hashundreds of systems to be arrayed on a chart of this kind for it to be of most value. this task is not complex, andthe results would greatly facilitate understanding both the òas isó and the òto beó contemplated by the trilogyprogram and other fbi it planning.other words, the fact that the fbi was unable to present its own version of these figures wastelling to the committee about a lack of clear architectural thinking. without such a topleveldescription and understanding, all of the subsidiary steps in the design and implementation ofan enterprise it system are at significant risk of failure.it is important for the fbi to create and use its own versions of figures 1 and 2 to helpexplain its strategies, and to do the supporting work required to fill out their content. oncethis is done, it does not matter if the fbiõs own versions agree with the committeeõs figures,and a detailed acceptance or rejection of the committeeõs figures is not relevant.the committee recognizes that the framework described above is only one way to conceptualize enterprise architectures. for example, the federal enterprise architecture (fea) framea review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action21work,5 to which the fbi has already committed itself, is used in many federal agencies. multiagency use of the fea framework enables architectural efforts presented using its fivecomponent framework to be directly compared across agencies. nevertheless, the committee believes that the architectural triad described above is conceptually clearer and morestraightforward than the fea framework and that the fbi will make more rapid progressusing the triad even if some translation between the triad and the fea framework will likelybe necessary at the end of the process.recognizing the role of top management in creating an enterprise architecturean enterprise architecture has far more operational content than technical content. accordingly, the fbiõs enterprise architecture must be based on mission needs and must be formulated, propagated, owned, and evolved by the operational leadership of the fbi at the highestlevels (the fbi director and the directors of the fbiõs missionoriented divisions).6an effective process requires that the enterprise architecture be created by a combinedeffort involving both senior operational management and key technologists. the cio plays akey role as the facilitator of the process; however, the creation of the enterprise architecturecannot be handed off to the cio, and certainly cannot be outsourced. the enterprise architecture is central to an organizationõs strategy, as well as important for process analysis, change,and planning. outside expertise can play a role in assisting and advising the enterprisearchitecture process, but the fbiõs top management team must manage, buy into, and executethe process.although this task is critical, it need not be an enormously timeconsuming one. withadequate time and focus on the part of senior operational management working with key itpeople, major progress could be made in a week of intense work, and the creation of a reasonably complete operational architecture together with a toplevel schematic systems architectureñthe most critical part of the enterprise architectureñshould be possible in a 6monthtime frame.7 further, committee experience indicates that progress is best made with the toplevel management team supported by an architecture team composed of a small number offulltime professionals dedicated to the task. these individuals must understand operationsand have some appreciation for technology, rather than being technologists with only a looseconnection to the operational side.given the fact that the leadership of any large organization, including the fbi, has manyongoing demands on it, the temptation is large to simply hire a cio with a great deal oftechnology experience, delegate the task, and then forget about the problem. why must anorganizationõs operational leadership be deeply engaged in the development of an enterprisearchitecture for it? why canõt this function be outsourced?5the fea is a business and performancebased framework to support crossagency collaboration, transformation, and governmentwide improvement. see http://feapmo.gov/.6in principle, it is also possible to begin with a vision of how technology might enable missions to be accomplishedñthat is, toseek a technologydriven enterprise architecture. but such an approach demands an extraordinarily high level of sophisticationabout the capabilities and limitations of technology, and for reasons that this report documents, is not appropriate for the fbi.7the executive assistant director for intelligence testified to the committee that a small team working full time for about 10weeks was able to develop a concept of operations for the office of intelligence. thus, 4 to 6 months of work does not seemunreasonable for developing the operational dimensions of a larger enterprise architecture.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.22a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programthe committeeõs experience is that without the drive of operational missions, technologydeployments inevitably serve to automate existing functions at a relatively low level, and thusthe processes associated with these functions remain static. even worse, automation of existing functions can degrade the ability of an organization to carry out its missions. the reasonis that the functions that an organization must serve are sometimes in tensionñconsider anorganization that must keep sensitive information secure (a driver for restricted access), andyet make it available to everyone with legitimate need (a driver for broad access).when people deal with these competing demands, they make judgments and ad hocdecisions on the basis of their experience and expertise. despite the existence of functionaltensions in a nonautomated system, human flexibility and adaptability generally ensure thatoperations can function at an adequate level of performance. indeed, in most organizations,what people actually do on the job varies from what is specified by the organizationõs formalprocesses. these variances do not arise because people are poorly motivated or lazy, butrather because people are highly motivated, and the variances are usually necessary for realwork to be done.the fact that humans resolve these conflicts so smoothly, however, usually means that thetensions inherent in differing functions are hidden from view. technology deployments bringout these tensions, and force someone to decide, in advance, how the tradeoff should beresolved. when automation is implemented in an organization without the benefit of operational knowledge (i.e., without taking into account what the organization is trying to do), thetradeoffs involved in deciding what to deploy are made in a vacuumñand often wrongly.only the senior operational management is in a position to articulate explicitly how thesetradeoffs should be resolved.beyond the need to develop an enterprise architecture to manage the it investment process,it is important to recognize that the activity of developing an enterprise architecture oftenresults in a (highly desirable) reexamination of operational processes. that is, by focusing onwhat technology can and should do for an organization, attention is naturally drawn to theprocesses it is intended to supportñand often the processes themselves are seen to be outmoded, unnecessary, or ripe for streamlining, often because they were based on the limitations of older technology or on requirements that are no longer current. such discoveries arevaluable in themselves in that they help an organization function more efficiently even apartfrom its investments in technology. such opportunities can be expected to arise when examining the processes of investigation and intelligence at the fbi.finally, as missions evolve, so must an enterprise architectureñand in that sense, anenterprise architecture is never final. since it is only the senior operational leadership that canmake basic decisions about the organizationõs missions, they will need to have a continuinginvolvement in the evolution of the enterprise architecture and a process to periodically revisitit. this point again reinforces the idea that an articulation of the operational dimensions of anenterprise architecture cannot be outsourced.2.1.2fbi activities with respect to enterprise architecturebased on fbi briefings and presentations to the committee, the committee believes that thefbiõs efforts and results in the area of enterprise architecture are late, limited, and fall far shortof what is required. indeed, in spite of the fact that the trilogy projects are far along andsubstantial resources have been expended, the fbi has only very recently begun serious effortsa review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action23to create its enterprise architecture, and no comprehensive enterprise architecture is in placetoday.8for example, the fbi reported to the general accounting office that it has completed andapproved an enterprise architecture òfoundation document.ó9 however, the fbi made noreference to this document or its content in its october 2003 and december 2003 presentationsto the committee, despite its publication on august 23, 2003, and despite the fact that thecommittee raised questions about enterprise architecture many times during those sessions.ultimately, the committee learned of this document by reviewing a doj inspector generalreport, and it obtained a copy of the document in early 2004.committee members have reviewed this document and believe that the document doesbegin to discuss at a high level some of the issues discussed above about linking the it systemto missions and operational processes. however, little followon work appears to have takenplace as of the time of this writing (late march 2004).in addition, the fbi has undertaken other efforts that could reasonably represent seeds ofarchitectural work that needs to be done more broadly. the office of intelligence has embarkedon a laudable effort to develop the beginnings of its own architectural subframework, andspokespeople from that office were able to relate it requirements to operational process at ahigh level in a convincing manner. those responsible for the vcf project have also developedan architectural subframework that appears adequate to support the initial rollout of theapplication in 2004. the vcf may well be a component that can be made, with some effort, tofit into the enterprise architecture when it is created. nevertheless, these architectural effortsñimportant though they areñdo not substitute for an overall architecture that addresses themissions of the fbi collectively.the committeeõs concerns about inadequate enterprise architecture work are reinforced bythe fact that only in the fy2005 budget enhancement request will the bureau include verysubstantial funding for enterprise architecture related activities, and that this request wasunder consideration at doj and the office of management and budget (omb) as of september2003. (the fbi is further seeking to obtain an interim system engineering, integration, and testcontractor to blend the trilogy vcf, the secure counterterrorism operational prototype environment (scope), and the integrated data warehouse (idw), and several smaller efforts, intoa unified and functioning whole.10)under the best possible circumstances, this fy2005 budget enhancement request will takeeffect october 1, 2004, suggesting that fbi effort in this area will not be substantial at least untilthen. moreover, the fact that this request has taken the form of a budget òenhancementó forfy2005 implies that the fbi has given this task a lower priority than might be implied, forexample, by a request for authority to reprogram existing funds from fy2004 for this effort. inthe absence of a serious enterprise architecture effort, even the interim plan to blend the vcf,scope, and the idw will be very difficult to achieve.8in this regard, the committeeõs conclusion echoes the primary finding of the general accounting office report the fbi needsan enterprise architecture to guide its modernization activities (general accounting office, gao03959, september 2003, availableat http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03959.pdf).9see response of the fbi to the gao report the fbi needs an enterprise architecture to guide its modernization activities, datedseptember 22, 2003. available

of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programbeyond the lack of anything resembling a complete enterprise architecture, of most concern to the committee is the fact that most of the senior operational management of the fbidoes not seem to have been deeply engaged in either the nascent architecture efforts or inshaping the trilogy effort. for example, the enterprise architecture foundation document wasproduced by an entity called the architecture governance board, whose members are apparently drawn from the fbi it communityñand did not include senior individuals from themajor operational units of the bureau. that is, it does not appear to reflect substantial involvement by the senior operational leadership of the fbi and hence cannot be sufficiently completeto guide the fbiõs it development and deployment efforts.this must change. for the it modernization to succeed, frequent and engaged participationby the fbiõs senior operational management in the creation and review of an enterprise architecture is necessary, and must be followed up with ongoing and systematic monitoring of the fbiõsand contractor plans and progress through implementation. a properly designed process fordeveloping an enterprise architecture can allow senior management to play their essential rolewithout placing excessive demands on their time, and being actively engaged in the creation of anenterprise architecture does not necessarily mean that the senior operational management isresponsible for every step. rather, as the enterprise architecture is being created, the senioroperational management must be involved in sessions at which there is serious discussion of theenterprise architectureõs contents, and where important decisions are made. many of these issuesand decisions involve policy questions, including a determination of whether a relevant policyexists and thus should be reflected in the enterprise architecture, or needs to be created.the committee believes that the absence of an enterprise architecture has been a majorcontributor to the problems faced by the implementers of the trilogy program. that is, thelack of an architecture to guide the planning of an information and communication infrastructure has resulted in improvisation that has virtually no chance of resulting in a wellordered infrastructure for the enterprise to build upon. in fact, merely providing parts (e.g.,computers and accessories, piecepart applications, and so on) is like buying brick, mortar,and lumber and expecting a builder to produce a functional building without benefit of building codes, blueprints, or an understanding of how people will use the building.2.1.3data management issues arising from the absence of an enterprise architecturethe fbiõs lack of an enterprise architecture has manifested itself in many ways. forexample, as noted above, the counterterrorism mission requires access to and the exchange ofcomprehensive and timely information. thus, it is easy to imagine that the fbi will, undersome set of circumstances, need to receive and/or send information from or to state and locallaw enforcement agencies (e.g., local police departments), its counterparts in foreign nations,or other members of the u.s. intelligence community.11 the identification of precisely which11a proofofprinciple project (the gateway information sharing project) was established in st. louis in april 2002 to integrateinvestigative data from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies into one database that will ultimately be accessible toall participating agencies via a secure internet connection. the project merges investigative files and records from all levels oflaw enforcement into a single, searchable data warehouse, providing investigators and analysts the ability to search the actualtext of investigative records for names, addresses, phone numbers, scars, marks, tattoos, weapons, vehicles, and phrases. theproject is the result of cooperation between the fbi and a variety of state and local police departments in the st. louis area andsouthern illinois. see doj press release of october 9, 2002, òattorney general john ashcroft unveils gateway informationsharing pilot project in st. louis, missouri.ó available at http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2002/october/02ag590.htm.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action25parties the fbi will share information with and the conditions under which information willbe shared has profound implications for its enterprise architecture, and is an issue that thesenior operational leadership must address.a second issue is a potential confusion between mission and process. in discussions withthe committee, senior fbi personnel repeatedly stated that òinvestigation and intelligence arethe same thing.ó while it is true that the mission of criminal investigation makes use ofintelligence processes, this fact does not mean that an it infrastructure to support investigationshould be the same as an it infrastructure that can support intelligence. for example, themeasure of success of an infrastructure that supports investigation is whether it helps agentsto do their investigation more effectively, more efficiently, or with greater quality of output andnational impact. agents are the primary actors in criminal investigations, and they taskanalysts; thus, the developers of an it infrastructure for investigation should regard agents astheir primary customers.by contrast, the mission of counterterrorism is intelligenceheavy. the measure of successof an it infrastructure for intelligence is whether it helps the analyst perform analytical functionsmore effectively/efficiently, e.g., helps analysts identify patterns, clues, or other informationgenerally indicative of events that have not yet occurred. in the intelligence process, analystsare the primary actors, in that they are the ones primarily responsible for analyzing a widevariety of information, from both open and classified sources, in order to identify impendingterrorist actions that must be disrupted or preempted. thus, agents will act on the informationgiven them by analysts, and those actions are generally mapped into a criminal investigation.presumably, agents also serve as collectors in the counterterrorism mission, and therefore canbe tasked by analysts.the following are some important differences that must be kept visible in designing itsupport for the investigation and intelligence processes:¥analysts tend to place a higher priority on access to a broad array of informationresources, while investigators tend to place a higher priority on highly targeted information.¥analysts may find òbadó or òuntrustworthyó information contextually useful, whileinvestigators may regard it as a liability and would want such information purged as soon aspossible.¥analysts must understand context and how a situation changes over time; investigatorsoften place a higher value on information that can serve as evidence and fact.¥analysts must handle and manage classified data, while investigators must generally,though not always, manage òlaw enforcement sensitiveó or òsensitive but unclassifiedó data,which entails an entirely different set of requirements.12in general, criminal investigation and intelligence are sufficiently different processes thatthe fbi would be wise to view the development of an overall enterprise architecture, particularly at the systems level, as calling for two subarchitectures with welldefined interfacesbetween them. an interface between the two subarchitectures is defined by the data that theyexchange and share. these interfaces will require enforcement and oversight so that only12there are exceptions to these generalizations, of course (e.g., investigations for counterintelligence purposes often generateclassified information). but in any case, these exceptions represent only a small fraction of the total information collected.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.26a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programnecessary data are passed between them, and it will take senior operational managementattention to define what data are ònecessaryó and what the policies are for the interfaceengines. further, these interfaces have profound implications for the systems and technicalarchitectures in areas such as standards that facilitate data exchange.2.2designing it systems to support fbi strategyand operational needsthis section comments specifically on a few important applications design issues, including overall system structure; the design of data repositories; and workflow, security, andaccess, as well as a collection of specific deficiencies in the vcf and other applications. in mostcases, these issues are a consequence of the lack of an enterprise architecture, and thus of thedisconnect between enterprise architecture and technology planning and design.2.2.1the virtual case file application of trilogythe virtual case file, the user application component of trilogy, is a customdesignedsoftware application that is intended to facilitate case file management by integrating datafrom older, separate investigative systems, including the automated case support (acs)system, and eventually replacing them. the vcf is intended to create efficiencies in enteringcaserelated information by reducing the number of steps in filing documents and to facilitatethe storage and retrieval of data for wider access, tracking, and analysis of caserelated data.13the vcf is a new it application designed to be the primary operations system to supportthe investigative mandate of the fbi. the design process was under way prior to the additionof the intelligence mission, and the requirements for the intelligence mission were not includedin the vcf design.the vcf is a significant step forward from todayõs acs system, and considerable progresson the vcf seems to have been made since september 2002. (the committee underscores theterm òseems,ó because it was shown only a mockup of the application, and not the applicationitself. that is, the committee viewed a canned presentation, because no working applicationwas available at fbi headquarters. the committee notes that there is often a significantdifference between the impression conveyed by a mockup and what an actual application cando in practice.)perhaps the most importantñand commendableñdevelopment in the vcf effort is theappointment of a very experienced and computersavvy fbi special agent as program manager who has played a strong role in driving the design from user requirements. to thecommittee, this individual appeared eminently capable of articulating user needs based onoperational experience rather than speculation, and the committee believes that it is thismanagerõs operational insights that served as an implicit enterprise architecture (more precisely, a subarchitecture) for the vcf and that have consequently been a primary driver ofsignificant progress. as such, the vcf has the potential to serve agents well in their criminalinvestigation mission.13for further information about the virtual case file, see u.s. department of justice, office of the inspector general auditdivision, the federal bureau of investigationõs management of information technology investments, report no. 0309, december 2002,pp.91, 9499, available at http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/audit/fbi/0309/final.pdf.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action27nevertheless, the committee is deeply concerned about certain aspects of the vcf effort.in the wake of the vcf prime contractorõs failure to meet a critical delivery date for the trilogyvcf component rollout,14 the fbi has had to delay achievement of full system capability. in amemo delivered to the committee on february 11, 2004, the fbi noted that the revised schedule for trilogy calls for achieving full system network capability (i.e., full functionality to28,000 fbi employees at 612 sites) by april 30, 2004. based on the vcf developerõs originalestimate that it would require 6 weeks of full system capability for testing the vcf, andassuming full system capability by april 30, 2004, it was estimated that the earliest activationof the first release of the vcf would be approximately midjune 2004. subsequently, the fbiadvised that such an assumption would be incorrect given the level of immaturity of the vcfapplication delivered to the government in december 2003 and through continued evaluationof the application. the vcf vendor is scheduled to present to the government an estimatedtime to complete on april 8, 2004.the details of the new vcf plan have not been made available to the committee. but inbriefings held in october 2003, the fbi described to the committee a plan that would implement the vcf in what it describes as a òflash cutover.ó that is, the vcf would be rolled outfor employee use all over the bureau simultaneously (or nearly so). the date for this cutoverhas been postponed, but the committee is concerned that, because of schedule slippage, theamount of testing will be reduced even further below what is already an inadequate level.with limited testing, and no experience gained from a limited initial rollout, the fbi would beimplementing what amounts to a prototype throughout the bureau. this approach is nearlyguaranteed to cause missioncritical failures and further delays, as discussed below in section2.3.1, with significant implications for training, performance, coherence, internal morale,public image, and cost to recovery.the committee is also concerned that the vcfõs current design and technical specificationslack the flexibility needed to incrementally improve the application to support additionalfunctions important for the field agents and fbi management. this inflexibility will makefurther rounds of fixes and enhancements difficult. (note that the comments below are basedon a vcf mockup in a canned presentation to the committee, rather than the committeeõs ownexploration of a working vcf prototype.)based on the committeeõs understanding of and perspective on the vcfõs current design,some of the potentially important issues related to the vcf include the following:¥as described to the committee by the fbi and its contractors, the current implementation of the vcf appears to have embedded the workflows describing how information is to beentered, reviewed, and used. embedding the workflow in the application (that is, hardwiringit) will make any such changes in the future much more difficult (more expensive and slower)to implement. such changes are likely to be driven by changes in the operational processesthat the vcf supports.1514see u.s. general services administration press release, òcontractor misses it delivery date,ó november 3,2003. available at http://www.gsa.gov/portal/gsa/ep/contentview.do?pagetypeid=8199&channelid=13259&p=%7c40e6c831b9572449852568af00594486&contentid=14244&contenttype=gsabasic.15to illustrate how workflow changes might become necessary, note that fbi practices seem to be built around the assumptionthat only supervisorapproved documents have any status as information worthy of access by parties other than the originalcreator. however, in todayõs world of greater information sharing, an unapproved draft may well have information that mighta review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.28a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization program¥the vcf does not have an òoffline useó mode. without an offline mode, an agentworking a case cannot take copies or extracts of case materials into the field for reference, norcreate content offline that will then be synchronized into the vcf server when coming online.todayõs administrative procedures may prohibit such practices, but if mobile computing andremote access for agents become desirable and necessary (as discussed in section 2.2.4), theinability to access the vcf in an offline mode will become critical. remote operation, whetheroffline or via a communications link, has proved to be a major enhancer of productivity in awide variety of situations.¥in the vcf, documents are indexed with terms that are manually specified by supervisory agents without any auxiliary capability for the automatic generation of index terms.manual indexing reflects todayõs practice in the fbi, but modern indexing software can do avery good job of finding index terms in a corpus of text automatically. manual indexing willfail to supply terms that are outside the context of the human indexer, as many counterterrorism activities are likely to be. today, fulltext index systems that index every word in adocument are the foundation of powerful search engines, such as google, and are beingexploited to a higher level in extracting meaning automatically in some experimental systems.it is true that basic automatic indexing systems are unable to provide index terms that are notexplicitly represented in the text; for this reason, automatic indexing is not a replacement formanual indexing as much as it is a very fast and powerful supplement for it.¥the vcf appears to lack broad automatic notification of changes that are made. caseowners are made aware when documents are added to a case file, but no other parties arenotified. in an environment in which many people (investigators and analysts) may use a casefile, such lack of notification places a large burden on those users to check the contents of thecase file periodically. they will waste time in checking a file that has not been altered and losecurrency between the point of update and their access to the file. lack of notification is thus aninhibitor of collaboration.¥the vcf appears to lack useful capabilities such as bookmarking, favorites, or historyfeatures for an individual user. without such features (commonly available on most internetbrowsers), users are poorly equipped to remember where they are or where they saw interesting information. this fact is particularly significant when the volumes of information withwhich one is working are large. such capabilities would be useful now, but will be expectedby any user in the future.¥the vcf appears to be weak in its ability to sort data. the ability to sort columns ofnames or dates or other such information is quite valuable when one has only a vague memoryof a name or a date associated with it. for example, a user may remember that a documentwas from the june 2001 time frame. if the system does not allow a sort by date, the user isforced to search explicitly for all documents dated june 2001. this does not appear to be adrawback, until one realizes that his memory may be incorrect, and in fact the documentappeared on may 31. by arranging the entries according to date, the user can rapidly scanboth sides of the putative date index, and the negative impact on information retrieval oferrors in recollection can be reduced.prove useful to another agent or to another case, and procedures may need to be changed to accommodate a different sharingarrangement. other examples might be the need to cope with shifting organizational structure and roles, or with new missionsand legislation or regulation.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action29¥the vcf interface presented to the committee was inconvenient in some respects. forexample, the committee saw no evidence that hot links to organizational and user informationwere provided, even though such information could be supplied easily. to increase the vcfõsconvenience, a case file should have listings of everyone who accesses the file and shouldprovide online contact information about those users to facilitate contact.one might draw an analogy between the vcf and òblogsó (i.e., web logs). today, members of the internet community often use blogs to observe and comment on some theme, or todiscuss various topics. the vcf captures observations about a case, and may include acommentary describing the investigatorõs reasoning. some blogs support crossreferencingand commentary by contributors other than the primary author. the vcf, particularly whenseen through an analytic lens, might benefit from richer discussion and content, dynamiccrossreferencing of cases, and external commentary on the reasoning behind a case or crossreferences. the culture of blogs and the technology to support them may provide a rich sourceof external ideas for the future functionality of the vcf, as well as commercial technology forfuture implementations. an example is the really simple syndication protocol used withblogs to notify interested parties of changes, thereby eliminating the need to constantly revisita blog to understand what has changed.all of the above issues can be addressed in subsequent releases of the vcf. a more stagedrollout of the vcf would likely have resulted in more focus being put on these and other stilltobeidentified shortcomings. the vcf will certainly require ongoing multiple releases, andit is essential that the fbi substantially enhance its capabilities in design and implementationfor these ongoing investments.2.2.2data management and the integrated data warehouse (idw)the fbi has a tremendous quantity of data, most of which comes from its investigativeprocesses. this data must be organized and managed in a way optimized to promote theeffectiveness of the bureauõs agents and intelligence analysts. access capabilities required forintelligence analysis to determine possible events in the future often differ greatly from theaccess capabilities required for reliable case records management, which has the mission oforganizing and retaining information to meet rulesofevidence requirements. accordingly,because it need not follow rules of evidence, the intelligence process may have different trustmodels governing browsing of information.thus, the information requirements of the investigative and the intelligence missions ofthe bureau are very likely to require very different work processes and information access. itis very likely (nearly certain) that different data models will be required in order to provideefficient support for these separate missions. furthermore, each mission of the bureau hasunique constraints for access to the information and will require different security models anddifferent tradeoffs between security and accessibility. implementation of these models islikely to show that distinct systems, with overlapping contents and interface engines to managedata sharing and interorganization handoffs, will be needed to assure manageability in thepresence of conflicting constraints.the integrated data warehouse (idw) will serve as a repository to store external datafrom a variety of sources that come into the agency at different frequencies, such as criminala review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.30a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programinformation from other government agencies and visa data.16 the idw will remain separatefrom the vcf but will replicate much of the data in the vcf. with proper security and sharingrules placed on the data, the idw is intended to allow teams of analysts and agents to runqueries horizontally across the data, and to share subsets of the data with other governmentagencies.17according to briefings to the committee, the idw is intended to be a resource for intelligence efforts (among other roles), and to be used by fbi analysts and shared with otherintelligence agencies. for such analyses data from nonfbisources will have to be included inthe idw.these briefings also suggested that data modeling efforts for the criminal investigationmission were just getting started. further, the data models of the idw presented to thecommittee (and the vcf for that matter) were far too abstract to be very useful, though thepresentation from the intelligence side recognized that there were differences in need betweenthe investigative and intelligence analysis functions.18three examples will suffice to illustrate a disconnect that needs to be resolved between thedata models as described to the committee and operational needs:¥presentations to the committee raised the issue of data currency. that is, intelligenceanalysts seemed to expect to have access to live databases containing the most current information, while the design of the fbiõs data warehouse incorporated copies of production databases. if the warehouse is intended to contain copies, the issue is raised concerning thefrequency at which the warehouse copies are refreshed from production databases.¥the idw appeared to have been designed to overwrite old copies of databases withnewer copies, so data can be there one day and not the next (that is, the idw is not equippedto handle timeseries of versioned data). while having only the most recent copy of data maybe appropriate for the purposes of an investigation (presuming the most recent copy is themost accurate and reliable), this assumption is almost certainly not valid for intelligence purposes.16the committee notes that the idw acronym itself is subject to some confusion. director mueller has made reference incongressional testimony to an òintegrated [italics from the committee] data warehouse [that] will link 31 fbi databases for singleportal searches and data mining.ó the doj inspector general report states that òthe fbi expects to use the network to transportthe investigative [italics from the committee] data warehouse, which will link 31 fbi databases for singleportal searches and datamining,ó and the fbi briefed the committee on idw referring to the òinvestigative data warehouse.ó whether this inconsistentuse of the acronym is inconsequential or reflects a deeper confusion within the fbi about the purview of data to be contained inthe idw remains to be seen. for muellerõs testimony, see http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress03/mueller032703.htm; forthe doj ig report, see http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/audit/fbi/0336/exec.htm.17robert s. mueller iii, òcongressional statement on federal bureau of investigationõs fiscal year 2004 budget,ó houseappropriations

http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress03/mueller032703.htm.18data models are generally used by system architects and designers in an iterative refinement process that starts with aconceptual data model, which deals with the key business concepts of the database, and then proceeds to a logical data model,which allows designers to reason about the primary relationships among the key data tables and elements, and then finally endsup with a physical data model, which documents the database implementation details. modern computeraided softwareengineering tools often facilitate the refinement process, reducing the labor required to construct and manage the three levels ofmodel. rather than include any specific recommendations about data modeling, the committee notes that the fbiõs enterprisearchitecture effort should identify a data modeling framework to be used by developers and implementers. an essential elementof data modeling is a data dictionary, which defines the basic structure and organization for the database with which it isassociated. the construction of data dictionaries for the various databases is an essential prerequisite for sharing data betweendatabases.a

what was presented when the committee asked about data models were notdata models at all, but rather hierarchical xml descriptions of various criminal justice documents (e.g., arrest forms, booking reports, sentence orders, and so on).to illustrate what a highlevel enterprise perspective on data management might entail,consider that it systems for the fbi must serve multiple operational functions. from thecommitteeõs perspective, the major classes of data are data to be kept in:¥the active case records used by the field agentsñthese are to be served by the vcfsystem under development.¥a broadbased data warehouse to serve intelligence tasks now assigned to the fbiñthese were served by the scope prototype demonstration and are to be served by the idwfollowup projects.¥a reliable repository of record that will provide a formal backup source for prosecutionof criminal cases, intelligence investigations, and internal audits. it is restricted to holdingdata for which the fbi is formally responsible. as such, it will be smaller, less visible, andmore stable than other fbi data systems, will be highly reliable and capable of becoming thefbiõs replacement for paper documentation, and will spare other fbi it systems some of themore stringent requirements that can inhibit their operation.¥a wide variety of management and administrative databases for personnel, capital andregistered item inventory, evidence tracking and inventory, and so on, to allow fbi headquarters to carry out its responsibilities.data in each of these classes are not entirely independent of each other, and thus applications to manage these types of data must have linkages among them. (for example, information related to a given legal discovery motion or freedom of information act request may becontained across these different types.) in addition, there may well be linkages to datacontained in databases operated by other agencies (e.g., data supporting fbi intelligence tasksmay well originate in databases operated by the cia). however, the fact that the applicationsmust have linkages among them does not mean that the databases must be colocated orshould be managed by the same staff under the same access rulesña point especially likely toapply to datalinking connections to intelligence agencies.to understand fully the highlevel requirements for these applications, their objectivesmust be made explicit. based on what it learned from the fbi about its data handling needs,the committee infers the following list of objectives for systems that handle each major class ofdata described above.the vcf should:1a.serve the field agents and their supporting analysts, wherever they are, in tasks ofinformation collection and analyzing the collected information on their cases.1b.be available 24/7.1c.allow convenient upgrading of services as needed by the agents and enabled by technology.1d.provide linkages to data in the idw and other fbi databases, and allow insertion ofrecords from other sources that have been determined to be pertinent to a case by theresponsible agent and his/her supervisor.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.32a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization program1e.purge closed cases, but keep track of them for analysis purposes.1f.keep all the information secure vis‹vis outsiders (i.e., outside the fbi).1g.keep some elements secure vis‹vis most fbi personnel.1h.be flexible enough to accommodate changes in operational processes that may bemade in the future.1i.resist tampering with records.1j.support an appropriate degree of auditing when information is entered or changed.1k.support audits for system use (a security measure).

noindividual division or employee ôownsõ fbi information.ó such a principle is attractive, for entirelyunderstandable reasons. but the agents who collect the data will undoubtedly be concernedabout maintaining control over data distribution and protection of sources and methods.today, these issues are managed through informal informationsharing networks of agentsand analysts that operate not only on the basis of formal access control provisions such as levelof security classification but also on personal knowledge and trust of the individuals involved.information management systems that do not provide these agents with some control overthe release of certain kinds of information may increase the likelihood that important information may not be entered at all. agents or other information collectors may be inclined to keeptwo sets of recordsñone for official use and one for more sensitive information, allowing themto maintain control over the disposition of sensitive information.this recordkeeping challenge, whether based on realistic concerns or perception, is unlikelyto be overcome by fiat. that is, a directive that agents and other collectors record officially allinformation, regardless of the sensitivity of its source, is likely to be quietly disregarded inmany instances. such disregard would not necessarily be gratuitous, but rather an entirelyunderstandable reaction of collectors in the field who might be reluctant to trust the security oftheir sources to another party.2.2.3scopethe fbi demonstrated the secure counterterrorism operational prototype environment(scope) to the committee. this demonstration illustrated the analytic tool suite with synthetic data. the analytic tools were based on commercially available products that includedsupport for data visualization, relationship analysis, and automated language translation.because this demonstration was not done using operational data or the trilogy network, thecommittee cannot comment on the performance or scalability of this approach.19for example, a july 2003 draft integrated information sharing plan lists the following eight guiding principles that the fbiexpects to apply to its informationsharing strategy.¥all fbi data is to be shared within the fbi, with very few exceptions.¥the ownership of fbi information is corporate; no individual division or employee òownsó fbi information.¥the fbi will have a single, integrated information space, in which the default will be to share with agencies with dueconsideration for the protection of sources and methods, and the security and prosecutive objectives of investigations.¥the fbi will not filter information internally but instead will create an overarching fbiwide policy that balances the needfor crosscorrelation with the risks of misuse.¥the view of what the fbi collects and what the fbi creates will look very similar.¥all data collected must also be recorded, searchable, retrievable, and easily crosscorrelated.¥fbi employees will have the ability to conduct federated queries across multiple systems to identify relationships.¥technology will be in service of people instead of people in service of technology. the fbi must have interconnectivity withintelligence community systems. additionally, the fbi must leverage existing technologies instead of rebuilding them.the committee did not review this draft plan. the text above is contained in a doj office of the inspector general report, thefederal bureau of investigationõs efforts to improve the sharing of intelligence and other information, report no. 0410, december 2003,available at http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/audit/fbi/0410/findings2.htm.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action35the committee believes that the fbi has an important opportunity with scope. here, thefbi is not burdened by a legacy of analytic tools and data models. it has a unique opportunityto assemble and integrate the most promising analytic ideas and tools. a wellconceptualizedenterprise architecture and data models are critical to successfully exploiting this opportunityand creating an environment that can incorporate the best analytic ideas and products overtime. (this point reinforces the immediate need to develop and understand the data modelsand the workflow.)the fbiõs use of commercial products is laudable. this willingness to look beyond conventional sources for the best available ideas can provide the fbi with an analytic advantage. thecommercial market for such tools is being driven by much broader trends than just counterterrorism. these trends include the private sectorõs desire to analyze and support market data,and the increasing globalization of markets. by harnessing the commercial market for analytictools, the fbi can gain access to far more creativity than it could ever capture with internallydeveloped tools.commercial products can also be expected to incorporate the best practices in humancomputer interfaces. even if the fbi does not use commercial tools, it should study theirhumancomputer interfaces and incorporate the best ideas into the tools it develops internally.an approach rooted in commercial products does not rule out oneofakind tools that areinternally developed.2.2.4mobile computingthe fbiõs interest in wireless data communications appears to be driven primarily byoperational continuity considerations. for the most part, the fbiõs experience with wirelessdata communications has been through personal digital assistants (pdas) used by a smallnumber of senior leaders. anecdotal reports suggest these individuals have found that wireless data communications enhance the conduct and accelerate the pace of daytoday business.to make further progress in this area, the fbi is planning a trial of pdas at a field office.such a trial can be the basis for establishing a baseline characterization of agent and otheractivities in that office to understand if the deployment of pdas has any impact. thinkingabout how to create a baseline characterization of office activities, which in the future mightinvolve mobile computing platforms such as pdas or laptop/tablet computers, can also contribute to quantifying an officeõs implementation of the fbiõs operational processes that are thecritical input to the fbiõs enterprise architecture. the planning and results of this trial shouldbe coordinated with the fbiõs enterprise architecture efforts.2.2.5securityloosely speaking, the security of an information system or network refers to its ability tocontinue to support authorized parties when it is under attack and its ability to resist theefforts of unauthorized parties to compromise its operation or data. for this report, it ishelpful to conceptualize security issues along two dimensionsñthose that arise from thedisconnect between the fbiõs operational mission needs and its enterprise architecture, andthose that arise from inadequate thought about the implementation of whatever securitypolicy is adopted.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.36a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programthe disconnect between the fbiõs operational mission needs and enterprise architecture isreflected in the fbiõs expression to the committee of a philosophy of zero tolerance for securityrisk, seeking not to manage risk but to avoid it. given that the fbiõs information systems areprime targets for criminals, espionage organizations, saboteurs, and terrorists (some possessingsignificant technical and human resources), the sentiments underlying this view are quiteunderstandable. nevertheless, the only approach that truly provides zero risk is one thatdestroys all information as soon as it is collected or that otherwise makes information entirelyinaccessible to anyone.a zero tolerance for security risk is doubly problematic in an environment in which information must be shared. there is a deep and unavoidable tension between information sharingand information security, and while there are mechanisms that allow design architects tomitigate this tension (a matter of implementation discussed below), some tensions areunavoidable, and at some point the senior leadership must decide what degree of security riskis acceptable and under what circumstances in return for the advantages of broadbasedinformation sharing.for example, it is the committeeõs understanding that agents and intelligence analysts arenot routinely provided with internet access for security reasons. it is certainly true that a lackof internet access will prevent internetbased security compromises, but it also impedes theuse of the internet to search for potentially valuable publicly available information. (forexample, fbi agents assigned to field divisions without internet access must go to publiclibraries to search the internet, and must use various commercial email accounts.) this is areasonable policy only under the implicit assumption that publicly available information isnot useful in either intelligence or investigationñand this assumption is simply not tenable forthe counterterrorism mission.furthermore, isolating fbi staff from the internet precludes their being educated by casualexposure to the best new ideas and tools emerging in the global internet community. whilethere are individuals with deep expertise, often gained by dedicated people spending theirown time and money, and there are specific provisions for controlled access to the internet,there is no substitute for the institutional and cultural impact of broad availability of internetaccess to all fbi staff.another important issue with profound consequences for security is raised by the attemptto make a single physical it infrastructure serve the needs of both intelligence analysts andlaw enforcement investigators. much intelligence information is classified, with rigid securityrequirements imposed by legal and national policy. however, much of the data related toinvestigations is unclassified (sensitive but unclassified (sbu) or lawenforcement sensitive).devising technologies and policies to manage both kinds of data under one rubric is thuspotentially contradictory, unless one is willing to accept the severe operational penalties oftreating unclassified information (sbu or lawenforcement sensitive) as classified.intelligence analysts also have a need for relatively unfettered òbrowsingó through information. however, sensitive information (e.g., identities of informants) can be derived ordeduced from aggregation and inference from large amounts of apparently unrelated data.there are ways to manage these tensions, such as allowing intelligence analysts access toòpointersó to protected internal information rather than the information itself, so that theanalyst can make a direct request for access to the party responsible for protecting that information. in the area of unclassified versus classified data, it would help to attempt to balancethe threat of misuse or inappropriate access against the benefits of allowing more use, e.g., bya review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action37remote agent access in the field; this process is known as a risk management assessment.nevertheless, the tension cannot be eliminated, and only the fbiõs senior operational management is in a position to judge how this tension should be resolved.a third security tradeoff will manifest itself when mobile computing becomes an issue.the value of mobile computing is likely to be high, but mobile computing is inherently morevulnerable than officebased computing, and the senior operational leadership will have todecide if the increased security risks are worth the added operational flexibility. empiricaldata and a formal evaluation process for mobile computing would be useful inputs to theleadership. the fbiõs pda experiment will help the leadership to think through how todifferentiate and measure communications that involve classified information, sbu information, and unclassified information, each of which has different security requirements.in the absence of any specific information on the subject but based on previous experience,the committee suspects that a significant fraction of, if not most, fbi data communicationstraffic need not be carried at the classified level. if the measurements associated with a pdatrial support this conjecture, the fbi may be in position to take advantage of wireless datacommunications in designing an infrastructure, systems, and processes to implement its enterprise architecture. such systems and policies could differentiate between sbu and unclassifiedcommunication, handle them differently, and significantly improve fbi metrics for efficiencyand effectiveness. if this conjecture turns out to be true, the fbi would also have to establisha clear policy governing sbu communications.the committee is also concerned about a number of security issues related to implementation. these include:¥the use of passwords for authentication. the weaknesses of passwords as an authenticationmechanism are well known (e.g., they are easily compromised without the ownerõs knowledge),20 and yet no thought seemed to have been given to alternatives.¥the lack of consistent security models between the idw and the vcf. in particular, thisinconsistency suggested that searches of data contained in the vcf from the data warehouseside would not be made visible to case owners. moreover, as long as security mechanismsonly provide access control, and do not log the information that is accessed, then misuse ofsystems by authorized users will not be visible until the information turns up in the wrongplaces. (and, of course, logs must be reviewed regularly by automated log analysis toolssupporting human analysts.)¥the operating system monoculture. the trilogy it modernization put into place a singleoperating system environment, and the security vulnerabilities of an operating system monoculture are well known.21 such an environment carries with it the risk that a single exploit,such as a worm or virus, can result in global failure of the trilogy network.22 the technology20see, for example, department of defense, password management guidelines, april 12, 1985, available at http://www.radium.ncsc.mil/tpep/library/rainbow/cscstd00285.html.21national research council, cybersecurity today and tomorrow: pay now or pay later, computer science and telecommunicationsboard, national academy press, washington, d.c., 2002.22note also that security risks may be especially great during a time of transition between old and new systems. the reason isthat anomalous system behavior can have multiple causes, and may reflect operator inexperience, inherent system bugs, oradversaryplanted exploitation. uncertainty about the actual cause may lead to inaction for a longer period of time than wouldbe the case during normal operation.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.38a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programdeployment plan relies on isolation from the internet and diligent network monitoring andresponse to protect against such problems. but neither of these approaches, taken singly or incombination, can eliminate the risk of catastrophic failure, and recent worm/virus experiencehas shown that selfpropagating, malicious code can enter isolated networks through anunwitting laptop user connecting to the isolated network after having been connected to, andinfected through, the internet. furthermore, the propagation speed of modern worm/viruscode is sufficiently rapid to overwhelm any monitoring and response center staffed by humans.¥seemingly inadequate contingency plans for operating under attack. a basic principle ofmanaging a critical operational network is that plans for maintaining operation in the face of acompromised element must be made in advance.ñhow are nodes in the network protected against other nodes that may have beencompromised? rather than a simple perimeter defense, a principle of mutual suspicionshould apply that does not allow an attacker who has breached the perimeter to have freeaccess to the entire network.23ñhow will the fbiõs publickey infrastructure be managed in the face of an insider threat?ñhow will key revocation be handled? emergency rekeying? access overrides (i.e.,how will authorized parties obtain access if access tokens and/or information are lost?)ñhow will worms and viruses be purged from the system if they are introduced?ñhow will the network respond to a denialofservice (dos) attack? there are manydifferent flavors of dos attacks, ranging from a deliberate attack on the inside of thenetwork to an attack occurring on the òoutsideó of the network that merely consumesbandwidth and degrades the performance of the public links that carry the virtual privatenetworks of the fbi.¥missing or incomplete validation of a security architecture, which the committee inferred onthe basis of presentations to it. specifically, the fbi did not provide to the committee evidencethat it had validated:ñthe putative design principle for security, which seemed to be characterized by anapproach of òbuild to disa (defense information systems agency) gold standard andback off until tools work.óñthe model of the threat that faces the fbiõs it systems. (note that a threat modelmust include threats emanating from both inside and outside the organization.)ñthe use of the electronic key management system developed by the national securityagency (nsa) in the context of the specific needs of the fbi.in each of these cases (the design principle, the threat model, the use of the nsa electronickey management system), the approach may be plausible and ultimately desirable. but aprocess of systematic validation is necessary before those conclusions can be drawn. moregenerally, a security architecture is based on an understanding of the data flows in the organization (derived from the enterprise architecture). based on these data flows, the databasesthat need to be isolated are identified. when necessary, controlled interfaces between isolatedand nonisolated databases are also identified. these interfaces are then mapped onto thephysical network configuration to decide what links/nodes must be encrypted, physicallyprotected, or both. lastly, the security architecture requires both a plan for managing encryptionkeys and a vulnerability assessment (i.e., a paper attack on the paper architecture).23to illustrate, this principle might call for the use of firewalls on every node of the network and antivirus protection runningcontinuously on all computers connected to the network to mitigate denialofservice or intrusion risks.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action39¥potentially inadequate proactive counterintelligence against inappropriately trusted insiders.as the robert hanssen case illustrates, security must be maintained against deliberateexfiltration of sensitive or classified information. counterintelligence tools for this probleminclude logging of access, analysis of logs, and possibly filtering of outgoing information.note also that notifying the owner of a sensitive information item that some other party hasaccessed that information is a potentially powerful way of raising red flags.¥potentially inadequate security of hardware and software implementation. when hardware isdeployed and software is written by outside contractors, there are greater risks that hostileparties working for the contractors may seek to insert trapdoors and other ways of bypassingsecurity in the systems being deployed. as a general rule, these risks can be managed, but theweakness of the fbiõs contract management abilities may mean that the fbiõs efforts in thisarea are not up to par (e.g., as with defense department special access projects). the sameconsiderations apply to commercially acquired infrastructure software. though it might bedifficult for an attacker to compromise a component of such software, the possibility cannot beruled out. moreover, even security patches and upgrades are not always guaranteed to workproperly, which means that installation of such upgrades cannot be undertaken blindly orwithout explicit thought from itsavvy managers.2.2.6privacyas part of the fbiõs briefings to the committee, the fbiõs privacy office addressed thecommittee, from which the committee concluded that the fbi did have some sensitivity tosome of the relevant privacy issues. however, the committee has not undertaken a comprehensive study of protection of individual and corporate privacy in the context of the fbiõs itmodernization program, and thus the comments below can only suggest some of the issuesthat may be involved.¥the fbi must proceed with great sensitivity to privacy issues as the counterterrorismmission assumes greater importance, and both substance and perception are important in thisdomain.¥there are many substantive issues associated with privacy. for example,ñthe fbi privacy office seemed to the committee to be geared primarily to protectingpersonally identifiable information from being improperly shared outside the fbi (e.g.,with contractors), and in the short presentation to the committee, its approaches to thisproblem seemed reasonable.ñanother privacy issue not addressed in briefings but of great concern to the privacysensitive segment of the public is the protection of the public from the abuse or improperuse of such data by rogue fbi employees acting on their own or through some officialthough perhaps not publicly acknowledged fbi program. the committee has no commenton this issue, other than noting that the simple exhortation òtrust usó is not likely to bereassuring to this segment even if in fact the fbi is doing everything possible to preventsuch abuses from happening.2424note also that section 223 of the usa patriot act allows individuals to recover monetary damages and litigation costsfrom the united states in the event that information or records are willfully and improperly disclosed, a fact that increases theimportance of keeping good records of who is accessing what data and under what circumstances. in addition, federal employeesfound to have improperly disclosed information are also subject to administrative action under the patriot act.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.40a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization program¥perception is at least as important as substance. that is, a technically wellconceivedprivacy protection program solves the substantive problem. but even with such a program inplace, the fbi must also pay attention to external perceptions, because those are a majorinfluence on the public trust that the fbi must maintain in order to be effective.2.3ensuring effective management ofit development and implementationthis section addresses a variety of serious management issues in the fbiõs it modernization program. issues and problems identified here relate to the management approaches andprocesses used by the fbi across the implementation life cycle, including requirements determination, development methodology, contracting and project management, system rollout,training, evaluation, and metrics of effectiveness. while the committeeõs comments regardingimplementation are derived from its consideration of the trilogy infrastructure and vcfprojects only, the committee believes that dealing systematically with these issues is essentialto success in followon efforts such as the idw and scope.2.3.1overall development methodologyin the committeeõs judgment, the fbiõs management approach to the trilogy modernization violates a number of basic principles that should govern the development of large systems.principle 1: any organization that depends on the continued operation of its it systems and ismodernizing those systems should plan on the simultaneous operation of both old and new systems forsome period of time, so that failures in the new system do not cripple the organization.largescale deployments involving new technology almost always come with problems(e.g., system crashes, unacceptably slow performance), and there is some risk that the problemswill be so severe as to prevent the effective use of the entire system for some period of time.accordingly, there must be backup and contingency plans in place that anticipate a widerange of failure conditions. however, the committee saw little evidence that such plans hadbeen formalized, and indeed has been informed that the current transition plan does notenvision the availability of the acs after the cutover to the vcf, even though the hardwaresupporting the acs is neither being redeployed to support the vcf nor being immediatelydecommissioned.effective transitions are usually managed gradually. even where the transition is abrupt,maintaining the function of the old system for some period as a fallback option is goodpractice. any acstovcf transition without a backup plan is far too risky for the fbi and forthe nation, especially in light of the fbiõs myriad and critical operational responsibilities to thenation that will continue during any such transition.the costs of maintaining a fallback plan and a supporting infrastructure are small compared to the operational costs associated with largescale vcf problems. moreover, becausethe hardware supporting the acs will not be converted to support the vcf, there is a residualand pragmatic disasterrecovery capability to revert to the acs. but contingency plans thatanticipate a continuing if temporary need for the acs must be made before the transition toexploit this residual capability, or else the use of the acs in this contingency mode will suffer.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action41expenditures to maintain an infrastructure that can support concurrent use of the acs and thevcf for a limited transition period would be a worthwhile insurance policy.principle 2: any organization undertaking a largescale it system development and deployment,but especially an organization without a strong track record in it development and use, should develop,test, evaluate, and iterate a smallscale prototype before committing itself to an organizationwideprogram.the development methodology for trilogy seems to be based on a oneway noniterativeprocess where rigid specifications are generated in advance. subsequent changes can then beargued to be òspecification changesó that open the door for schedule delay and increasedexpense. in truth, it is essentially impossible even for the most operationally experiencedapplications developers to be able to anticipate in detail all of the requirements and specifications in advance. therefore, development contracts should not make such an assumption, butrather should call for an approach to specification of user requirements that is based on aprocess of extensive prototyping and usability testing with real users.25to the best of the committeeõs knowledge, apart from scope, no prototype has beendeveloped for any of the major components of trilogy (the trilogy network or the vcf) or forthe idw. as the fbi recognized in developing scope, the advantage of a smallscale prototype is that it can be iteratively developed with strong user feedback and involvement, thusincreasing the chances that what is ultimately delivered to the end users meets their needs.this point is relevant to many dimensions of system development, including the functionalitydesired in a new application, the convenience and intuitiveness of a user interface, and thenature and mix of the operating load that the system must support under real operationalconditions.in some instances, the intimate involvement of project managers with extensive operational experience can play an important role in some of these dimensions (e.g., defining therequired functionality); indeed, the committee believes that it is the involvement of such anindividual in the development of the vcf that has been responsible for what success it is likelyto have when it is deployed. nevertheless, in the end there is no substitute for realism in theevolution of a prototype.principle 3: in largescale system development and deployment, testing should account for as muchas 35 to 50 percent of the project schedule if a successful deployment is to be achieved.testing is necessary to shake out bugs and flaws in a new system, and flaws will often beinvisible until after actual users deal with actual data. the 35 to 50 percent figure above is anexperiencebased rule of thumb that is widely accepted among those involved with largescalesystem design. moreover, an organization without a strong track record in it could reasonably be expected to require even more time for system testing and integration. testing is a25these comments do not mean that prototyping is a panacea that guarantees success. while prototyping usually has highvalue in developing requirements for user functionality, it produces results that are only as valid as the user group selected forinvolvement. furthermore, obtaining realistic results from prototyping exercises requires using realworld data. finally,prototyping is most valuable when understanding user requirements is the task at hand; it is less useful for determining reliabilityand response times for applications that will be deployed on a large scale.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.42a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programcritical dimension of system development and deployment requiring a welldeveloped testingstrategy and a progression from unit testing to fullblown integration testing, and usually callsfor dress rehearsals for system use.the project schedule for completion of trilogy as it was represented to the committee inoctober 2003 appears to leave inadequate time for testing. the committee was shown briefingcharts indicating that the fbi allocated less than 10 percent of its schedule for testing, andunder schedule pressure the contractor was trimming that amount even further. it was alsosurprising for the committee not to see, at a very late stage in vcf development, any kind ofriskbased prioritization for the items remaining to be done. instead, these items were lumpedtogether in the category òunfixed bugs.óto provide a simple example of the need for testing, it is important to realize that the termòworksó (as in the system òworksó) has a wide spectrum of possible meaning. consider asimple system, consisting of a network transport layer that moves packets and is responsiblefor encryption and decryption and an application running on top of it. beginning with theleast demanding definition, the expression òthe system worksó can plausibly mean that:1.the transport layer òlights upó but does not move application packets. nodes can findeach other, basic protocol functions such as òpingó work, and bits flow between asubset of the network and on the whole network.2.definition (1), and in addition data packets move between a subset of the network andon the whole network.3.definition (2), and in addition encryption and decryption are successful between nodeson a subset of the network and on the whole network.4.definition (3), and in addition the transport layer can move application packets undersimulated òrealisticó load between nodes on a subset of the network and on the wholenetwork.5.definition (4), and in addition users in different locations can use the application topass the appropriate information among each other.6.definition (5), and in addition the system functions with actual users using actual data.7.definition (6) with realistic numbers of users and the full complement of files.8.definition (7) with some reasonable assurance of the overall security of the applications, as opposed to the encrypted transport of bits alone.in the absence of a clearly specified test plan that is acceptable to all users, it is possible tomake a claim that the system òworksó according to any of these definitions, even though thepoint of failure in the development of many systems is encountered when they are required tocontinue to function under load. it is unclear for trilogy which definition of òworkingó isbeing used by those claiming that a system is working. in the case of the trilogy infrastructurenetwork, the vcf application is not yet available, and so it is clear that the higher levels offunctionality (definition (5) and above) have not yet been attained.2.3.2contracting and contract managementboth key contracts for trilogy (trilogy infrastructure and the vcf) were awarded on a costplus/cost reimbursable basis. only optional òtoolsó were awarded on a fixedprice basis.while the task orders (t0001ajm026 and t001ajm028) for both phases of the trilogy programa review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action43detail the firm fixed price to eight or nine significant figures, the task order schedules werealmost totally lacking in specifications and a commitment to checkpoints. for example, thedocuments list a large number of plans to be created, with dates òtbd.ó (the committeebelieves that one reason underlying the lack of detail in these critical documents is that theunderlying architectural work has not been done. in the absence of such architectural work,system specifications are hard to develop with any coherence.) under these circumstances,effective program and contract management becomes essentially impossible. this weakness,aggravated by turnover among key fbi staff (e.g., the fbi chief information officer), makes itunsurprising that trilogy is significantly behind schedule and over budget.to illustrate some of the problems with contract management, the fbi told the committeethat the trilogy network had been made operational on march 28, 2003, only because fbipersonnel in the program office were pressed into overtime service to compensate whencontractors failed to meet commitments. while such efforts point to the fbiõs admirablededication to duty, the need for the program office to stand in for a contractor is a sign ofcontractor failure. if these òabove and beyondó efforts of fbi staff could be converted intopenalties for (or dismissals of) the contractors, it would send a very positive signal that the fbiprogram office is becoming serious about contract management.for a contract of this magnitude and importance to the fbi and to the united states, it isimperative that senior management of the fbi monitor contractor progress closely and step inwhen necessary to forestall difficulties seen down the road, although daytoday involvementis not necessary. seniorlevel contract managers, experienced and empowered, should beassigned for the duration of the project, and should provide periodic actionable status information to fbi senior management. in briefings, it appeared to the committee that contractorsmay be viewing this project as governmental òbusiness as usual,ó without due regard to thecritical importance and congressional visibility of trilogyõs success or failure. clear anddetailed schedules with intermediate milestones, earnedvalue metrics, and severe penaltiesfor missed delivery dates and missing functionality are desperately needed.2.3.3program managementin the committeeõs judgment, the fbiõs program management of its it projects is weak, andhas been weak for over a year (based on the individual observations of many of the committeemembers who participated in the september 2002 meeting). weak program managementleads to a reactive mode in dealing with issues and a lack of overall project control. continuedcost overruns and delays often result from a lack of effective program management. bycontrast, effective program management with effective management of costs and proactivelymanaged it projects significantly increases the likelihood of success.for the committee, one of the most serious issues is that many essential tasks have beenoutsourced to vendors (e.g., development of data models and architectures). in essence, thefbi has left the task of defining and identifying its essential operational processes and its itconcept of operations to outsiders. this is not to say that outside contractors should have norole at all in these tasks, but rather that it should be the fbi, not the contractors, that definesand drives the process.a small but telling example of the fbiõs dependence on contractors is that the fbi reportedno contract provisions calling for the escrow of source code for the applications. escrow callsfor the deposit of source code files and appropriate documentation with a mutually trusteda review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.44a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programthird party during and after the completion of the contract. in the event that the vendorbecomes unable or unwilling to continue to provide service to the fbi (e.g., the developer mustbe replaced because of poor performance, or the developer goes bankrupt), the source code isreleased to the fbi so that it can seek another vendor to assume the first vendorõs responsibilities. source code escrow is a common, even routine, commercial practice.program management is a wellunderstood discipline and set of processes. a strongprogram management function must be established and supported by fbi management at alllevels to provide appropriate oversight and management of fbi it projects. an effectiveprogram management function will provide the fbi with a focal point for monitoring andcollecting project data and allow for the reporting of the progress of active it projects based onwelldefined metrics. (note that program management entails a set of skills and backgrounddifferent from those associated with operational experience in doing investigation or intelligence analysis. that is, a single individual may have strong program management skills andextensive operational experience, and arguably a òprogram manageró ought to have bothqualities, but there is no a priori reason to expect that someone with the former will necessarilyhave the latter. in any event, a program manager should at least have access to both sets ofexpertise.)for program managers to be effective, they must participate deeply in the negotiation ofcontracts with outside vendors. the contracts must include performance measures for keydeliverables, milestones, and service levels with penalties and escalation procedures. contractsshould ensure that the vendor suffers severe penalties if it is not meeting the performancemeasures, and major vendor failure should result in a penalty that allows the fbi to transitionto a new vendor with little or no financial impact to the fbi.program managers are responsible for validating, monitoring, supporting, and assisting inthe area of project and lifecycle costs. they may also supply information that can alter projectpriorities, based on resource availability or interdependent project conflicts. most important,program managers are responsible for implementing an appropriate methodology for projectmanagement, including at least the following:¥establishing a framework for all project communications, reporting, procedural, andcontractual activity;¥developing taskspecific project plans with timelines, critical paths, and specific deliverables;¥conducting project team meetings, setting schedules and agendas, and managing themeetings;¥monitoring milestones and deliverables and ensuring tracking to timelines;¥providing project status updates to key stakeholders;¥identifying deviations from plan and addressing issues on a timely basis for resolution;¥managing project budgets; and¥creating an environment where the project team can succeed.an important point is that effective program management generally requires close andfrequent interactions between managers and the project team and among team members.besides welltrained staff, the team also needs an environment that facilitates working effectively, such as proximity of offices, meeting spaces, and areas in which information can bepassed informally over lunch or in a chance hallway encounter rather than relying only ona review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action45formal channels of communication such as email, phone calls, voice mail, teleconferencing,and meetings of highlevel managers.26a particularly useful management tool is a project charter. the charter includes detailedproject requirements, resources, and the related roles of the project team, along with identifiedmilestones and deliverables. risk, issue and scope management, and communication plansare included.the project charter is designed to do several important things. the charter should:¥facilitate communication among stakeholders.¥document approved purpose, scope, objectives, cost, and schedule baselines.¥document the agreement between groups.¥define roles and responsibilities inclusive of the overall project governance.¥document planning assumptions and decisions.¥provide the baseline for scope and expectation management.in effect, the charter establishes a baseline of understanding among all stakeholders andespecially between the project manager and the project sponsor(s), business owner(s), andvendor(s). the success of the project may be measured against this charter. just as importantly, any changes must reference the charter.2.4ensuring the growth of fbi it expertise anddealing with external factorsthe fbi recognizes, and the committee agrees, that the fbi is severely lacking in many ofthe technical and management skills to successfully plan, contract for, and implement a projectof the breadth and scope of trilogy. this situation must be remedied both to complete theinitial phases of trilogy, and more important, to deal with the issues described in the preceding sections. in addition to filling the top jobs such as the cio with people who are willing toand capable of effectively managing the larger issues, a number of other gaps and constraints,some not of the fbiõs making, must be addressed.2.4.1human resourceswith a few exceptions, the presentations to the committee persuaded it that the fbi lacks ahuman resource base adequate to deal with its it modernization program. the fbi lacksexperienced it program managers and contract managers, which has made it unable to dealaggressively or effectively with its contractors. inexperienced managers generally lack theability to assume proactive management roles and are often held hostage to the perspectives ofthe contractor.given the importance of it personnel and analysts to the fbiõs broadening missions, suchindividuals must have career track opportunities that have status and respect that are compa26although many large organizations are able to effectively manage largescale efforts with geographically dispersed staff,success in this regard requires a considerable degree of it sophistication and adherence to welldefined and wellunderstood itpolicies and practices.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.46a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programrable to those of traditional personnel tracks (such as agents) within the bureau.27 such trackswould also enable stability in it jobs that require extended oversight and long institutionalmemory.on the positive side, the committee wishes to single out as especially noteworthy thepresentations it heard from the head of security for the it modernization program, the executive assistant director for intelligence, and the vcf project manager. these presentationsreflected serious thought about their respective responsibilities from the user perspective. forexample, the executive assistant director for intelligence presented a coherent and wellarticulated concept of operations, as well as a clear vision of how to draw talent from the restof the fbi. the presentations of the head of security, though not long enough to provide verymuch detail, were wellconsidered. and, the vcf project managerõs operational experiencehas been invaluable in keeping the vcf intellectually on track.although the committee met only a few of them, it believes that the fbi has an importantit resource in its younger agents. the fbi agents now being hired are in their late 20õs, and, aswith others in their peer group, have been heavily exposed to modern forms of informationtechnology for most of their lives. given this fluency with information technology, it is likelythat these newest agents will be the most enthusiastic about embracing new technologies toenhance their effectiveness. (of course, the flip side is that if the organization in which theyserve is unable to provide technology tools that they believe they ought to have and perceiveto be adequate, they are likely to be disappointed in the organization, with all of the consequences regarding morale, work attitude, and retention.)finally, the committee notes that the fbi has the authority to obtain it personnel from theprivate sector.28 under the intergovernmental personnel act (ipa), the fbi can borrow personnel from other government agencies (federal, state, and local), from institutions of highereducation, and from federally funded research and development centers. generally, thesearrangements call for the òhomeó agency or institution to pay the salary of the employee whileon detail status, though the fbi could agree to reimburse the home agency as part of the termsof the cooperative agreement. ipa details cannot exceed 4 years in duration.under the information technology exchange program (itep), the fbi can enter into acooperative agreement with a private sector organization for the exchange of personnel whowork in the field of it management, are considered exceptional performers, and are expectedto assume increased it management responsibilities in the future. while on detail to the fbi,the private sector organization employee may continue to receive pay and benefits from his/her employer, and the assignment may be made with or without reimbursement by the fbi forthe pay, or a part thereof, during the assignment and for any contribution to the private sectororganizationõs employee benefit systems. itep details cannot exceed 2 years in duration.the fbi also has the authority to hire it employees outright. senior it positions in the fbifall under the fbiõs senior executive service (ses) pay scale, the range of which is $103,700 to$157,000. in exceptional cases, the fbi can pay up to $174,500, though this step requires officeof personnel management and office of management and budget approval. the fbi is alsoauthorized to pay a lumpsum recruitment bonus of up to 25 percent of the annual rate of basic27note that the problem of enhancing the status of workers in a critical but supporting field is common in many organizations,both inside and outside the federal government.28information on fbi hiring authorities is derived from a memo from the fbi to the committee transmitted on february 11,2004.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.itrelated issues for the fbi requiring immediate action47pay to an employee, including individuals covered by the ses, who are newly appointed to adifficulttofill position.the fbi also has available positions classified as scientific or professional positions that areabove the gs15 level but do not meet the ses functional criteria. these positions encompassthe performance of highlevel research and development in the physical, biological, medical,or engineering sciences, or a closely related field. the pay scale for such positions in thewashington, d.c., area ranges from $117,627 to $144,600.in the judgment of the committee, these rates of pay should be sufficient to attract highlyqualified it talent. while it is true that highly qualified senior it personnel in the privatesector can command significantly higher salaries, stock options/bonuses, and the like, the fbialso offers opportunities for public service that compensate, in part, for the lower salary scales.these opportunities include the chance to have a substantial impact in service to the nation inan area of extraordinary import. the recent shift in the opportunity environment for it peoplehas no doubt increased the relative attractiveness of government service.2.4.2external constraintsthe fbi also operates under a variety of constraints that originate externally to the bureau.two of the most significant are the following:¥lack of management flexibility. agile organizations are managerially flexible so that theycan take prompt action. it is the committeeõs understanding that the fbi is unable to takemanagerial actions such as reprogramming amounts in excess of $500,000 without explicitcongressional approval. this constraint and others with a similar micromanagement flavorare inconsistent with the expectation that the fbi will move quickly and forcefully to reshapeitself to deal effectively with the terrorism challenge.¥audit pressure. the fbi reported that it had undergone more than 100 investigations andaudits in the it area. while it is true that the fbiõs performance in this area is seriouslydeficient (and this makes the fbi an attractive target), responding to such investigations usesthe time of senior management, both in preparation and presentation of material to thoseinvestigators. and because personnel in the it field are scarce within the fbi, the pace of workis slowed by such investigations. a better use of an equivalent amount of talent and energywould be to assist the fbi in dealing with its problems. nevertheless, it remains the case thatsome audits, such as the one prepared by the general accounting office as the fbi needs anenterprise architecture to guide its modernization activities of september 25, 2003 (released to thefbi august 22, 2003), contain valuable guidance.a third area of concern is the presence of inflexible and stringent rules for personnelqualification, though the committee is not certain whether these rules originate within the fbior outside it. stringent rules reduce the pool from which potential employees are drawn, andinflexible rulesñeven undertaken in the name of upholding standardsñmay inappropriatelydisqualify otherwise qualified individuals. of course, job applicants whose history indicates asubstantial variance from the standards for employment are unacceptable. but a rule ofreason ought to apply, and an otherwisequalified applicant whose history is only minimallyat variance with those standards should not be automatically excluded.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.483recommendationsthe fbiõs current approach to it modernization is not working as well as it must tosupport the fbiõs missions in criminal investigation and preventive counterterrorism. basedon recent history, its approach is not likely to be much improved without major changes. thecommittee believes that a culture change within the fbi relative to it is absolutely imperative.while the fbi needs to keep the forward thinkers among its force of experts, it will be severelyhandicapped unless it also culls out the elements in its leadership structure that are unable tolead the changes necessary to effectively implement an information age organization.the first and most urgent recommendation, indeed critical in light of the impending vcfsystem rollout, is that the fbi not proceed with deployment of the vcf until it has a validatedcontingency plan for reverting completely or partially to the acs, if necessary, and clear andmeasurable criteria to determine when the acs can safely be turned off.beyond this urgent recommendation, the committee makes a number of recommendations, grouped into four areas, that will significantly increase the likelihood of success in anddrive an accelerated pace for the fbiõs it modernization efforts. these recommendations fallinto two categories. category 1 recommendations are, in the committeeõs judgment, imperatives for the success of the fbiõs it modernization program, and are listed in the executivesummary. category 2 recommendations involve òbest practicesó or sound advice that thecommittee believes are appropriate to the fbiõs situation.3.1regarding enterprise architectureif the fbi is to be successful in its efforts to exploit it, the formulation of an enterprisearchitecture must have the highest priority in its it efforts. of course, an enterprise architecture can be expected to grow and evolve to reflect the increasing responsibilities of the fbi andthe increasing role that it will have in satisfying these responsibilities, but a baseline entera review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.recommendations49prise architecture is a crucial starting point. to deal with the issues related to enterprisearchitecture, the committee makes the following recommendations.category 1 recommendations on enterprise architecture¥the committee believes that if the fbiõs it modernization program is to succeed, thefbiõs top leadership, including the director, must make the creation and communication of acomplete enterprise architecture a top priority. this means that they must be personallyinvolved and invested in the key decisions that the process will require be made, such as thetradeoffs between the security of and access to information in the various data sources that areused in criminal investigation and counterterrorism efforts. indeed, it is critical that thedirector be well versed in, and comfortable with, the operational aspects of the enterprisearchitecture and their overall linkage to the highlevel system design.only when the fbiõs leadership takes intellectual ownership of the bureauõs enterprisearchitecture can it be used to make toplevel management decisions and to ensure that itinvestments realize their full potential. while a contractor might well assist the fbi in developing the enterprise architecture, no contractor will fully understand the operational issuesthat must be reflected in the enterprise architecture, nor be empowered to make decisionsabout how to make the tradeoffs with competing concerns.the committee believes that a small team, consisting primarily of senior operationalmanagers from the criminal investigation division, the office of intelligence, and the counterterrorism division, and a senior it executive (e.g., the cio) to translate what these managerssay into architectural terms, should be able to develop the broad outlines of the operationalaspects of the enterprise architecture as well as a toplevel schematic view of the systemsdesign in a matter of 4 to 6 months of fulltime work. to decide on the many operational andpolicy tradeoffs that will inevitably arise, this team must have direct access to and the frequentinvolvement of the most senior management of the fbi, including the director and the deputydirector.a reasonable first step in developing the fbiõs enterprise architecture would be to define,by job, the information necessary for each fbi division to accomplish its task. the output ofthis effort will not be sufficient to guide implementation detail, but will provide an understanding of the information flows for investigative and intelligence data, identify existingresources, and indicate how the information needs of major categories of users can be satisfied. further, it will provide a basis for the partitioning of implementation tasks, and identifyunmet needs.¥the fbi should seek independent and regular review of its enterprise architecture as itdevelops by an external panel of experts with experience in both operations and technology/architecture. when the first draft of the enterprise architecture has been prepared, it should bereviewed by an external panel of independent experts charged with helping the fbi to improvehow it uses it in the long term. this could be the fbiõs science and technology advisoryboard, an ad hoc committee or a contractor familiar with successful dod architecture efforts,or even an ad hoc committee such as this one, but the important point is that an externalinspection of the draft enterprise architecture is a sensible safeguard under any circumstances.¥given that the counterterrorism mission requires extensive information sharing, the fbishould seek input on and comment from other intelligence agencies regarding its enterprisea review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.50a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programarchitecture effort. the reason is that the fbiõs information systems must have interfaces tothose agencies to ensure that the information resources of those agencies are appropriatelylinked to fbi systems so that those agencies are able to work collaboratively.category 2 recommendations on enterprise architecture¥the fbi should build on the early efforts under way in the intelligence area in defininga subarchitecture for the intelligence process, rather than begin with the (implicit) architectureof the vcf. the vision for, and basic architecture of, the trilogy systemñincluding the vcfñpredates the post9/11 restructuring of the fbiõs mission priorities and relationships to intelligence. at that time, the fbiõs (and trilogyõs) focus was on support for the law enforcementmission. the change in the fbiõs mission since 9/11 underscores the need for agility and forthe separation of mechanism and policy in the information system architecture; many functions that would have been prohibited by policy before 9/11 are now accepted as essentialparts of the fbiõs operation.¥the fbi should make heavy use of scenariobased analysis in its development of anenterprise architecture. scenariobased analysis calls for understanding relevant scenarios insufficient detail that one can actually understand the information flows, analytic processes,and toplevel decisions that must be made in those instances. doing so will help the fbi toidentify specific roles for it in supporting operational needs.¥the fbi should give high priority to reducing the management complexity of its itsystems, even at the expense of increased costs for hardware that may appear duplicative orredundant. the successful management of a complex it system usually requires a largedegree of technical sophistication that the fbi lacks at present. as one example, the fbi shouldavoid the temptation to make the idw the single repository that contains all data regardless ofsensitivity or type. section 2.2.2 points out that the access and security requirements forintelligence data and investigative data are very different, and storing both types of data onthe same system will entail the implementation of a very complex set of access rules and asignificant cost in human effort to maintain and enforce those rules. the cost of the extracomplexity entailed by the singlerepository concept will, in the long run, far outweigh thecost of the òextraó hardware.box 1 provides a sampling (not an exhaustive or complete list) of some of the elements thatthe committee would expect to see in the fbiõs enterprise architecture.3.2regarding system designto deal with the most important of the system issues described in section 2.2, the committeemakes the following recommendations:category 1 recommendations on system design¥the fbi should refrain from initiating, developing, or deploying any it applicationother than the vcf until a complete enterprise architecture is in place. the committee hopesthat the initial operating capability of the vcf will soon be demonstrated. if successful, it willa review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.recommendations51box 1: a

trilogy information technology modernization programprovide such a major step forward from the acs that it would be a mistake to halt vcfdevelopment and deployment at this time. but in the committeeõs view, the benefit of designing future applications within the enterprise architecture framework is so large, and the risk ofdesigning without that framework in place so high, that no additional development shouldproceed until the framework is in place.1¥the fbi should develop a process map for information sharing that clearly defines thecurrent state of and a desired end state for the informationsharing process so that the numerous informationsharing initiatives can be coordinated and properly monitored and managed.this recommendation is derived from the doj inspector general report2 but is one that thecommittee fully supports. in a letter to the doj inspector general dated december 11, 2003,the fbi stated that it had already completed a detailed blueprint and process map on itsintelligence and information sharing process,3 but as of december 2003, neither the committeenor the doj inspector general had been able to review this document.4¥the fbi should immediately develop plans that address recovery of data and functionality in the event that essential technology services come under denialofservice attacks (e.g.,from viruses and pervasively replicated software bugs). in addition, the fbi should deploytechnically distinct platforms (that is, computing nodes that are based on a different operatingsystem) for the hosting or backup of critical services or data, so that in the event of a globalattack on the trilogy network, these services are more likely to be maintained and the uninfectedplatforms can serve as a òbeachheadó from which cleanup operations can be mounted.category 2 recommendations on system design¥the fbi should develop a future release plan for the vcf that specifies what capabilitieswill be added to it, and in what order and time frame. the committee believes that futurereleases of the vcf, other than those needed to reach initial functionality, should be delayeduntil an overall enterprise architecture is in place. further, the fbi should ensure that the firstenhancements to the vcf are to make the system consistent with the overall enterprisearchitecture (rather than only to add additional functionality). after that, capabilities to beconsidered include the addition of a separate workflow engine (a high priority, as describedbelow) and the creation and integration of interfaces to the idw. developing the plan in thecontext of the enterprise architecture is critical to aligning the development activities of theidw, scope, and the vcf, and other systems and to optimizing what will likely be significantinvestments downstream.¥the fbi should plan to rework the next version of the vcf to include a workflow engineas a high priority. by incorporating a workflow engine, the fbi will make the vcf more agile1the gao position, as documented in the gao commentary on the fbi response, is that it is acceptable for the fbi to beòpursuing nearterm it upgrades before it completes and is positioned to use an architecture,ó even though pursuing theseupgrades òwithout a blueprint that provides an authoritative, commonly understood frame of reference that translates strategyinto implemental actions

(note that commercial workflow engines areavailable that can be configured to support a myriad of workflow arrangements withoutmodifying the application programs they serve. workflow engines are a common technologythat is employed by many organizations, especially those that are large, complex, and geographically dispersed. furthermore, it staff might well include specialists trained in humancomputer interaction who can understand process flows and how to build systems that reflectnew protocols of agents and analysts.)¥the fbi should adopt a risk management approach to security, for only in doing so willit understand the operational penalties it pays for risk avoidance. acceptance of this premiseresults in several immediate items of high priority.ñthe fbi should establish a clear policy governing sensitive but unclassified (sbu)and lawenforcementsensitive communications (and data more generally). such a policycan be riskbased.ñthe fbi should reconsider, in the light of a better understanding of the risk/benefittradeoffs to its missions, the very constrained access that fbi staff have to the internet.ñthe fbi has stated that it is in the process of acquiring a risk management tool thatwill assist it in determining where it vulnerabilities should be mitigated through risk/costtradeoffs, thereby ensuring it continuity of operations, and that this tool will be interfaced with tools that the fbi uses to develop and manage its enterprise architecture efforts.these efforts should continue, although the committee notes that the threat driving theneed to ensure continuity of operations in the face of attack differs in kind from the threatof compromising sensitive information.if the fbi is not comfortable with moving to a risk management approach to security, at thevery least it should review security practices in a riskversusreward framework with an entireendtoend consideration of the information gathering and information management requirements of the fbiõs staff.¥the fbi should encourage creative experimentation with exploitation of it in the field,such as the pda experiment mentioned in section 2.2.4 above. the committee did not reviewthis area in detail, but it believes that such experimentation, with appropriate safeguards, hasenormous potential for helping the fbi to understand how its operational processes might beimproved through the use of it. further, the learning from these efforts to anticipate thetechnological future should be brought forward and become an important input into thebureauõs strategic planning process in order to accelerate its pace of modernization. (in thisregard, a useful philosophy is the one underlying the department of defenseõs advancedconcept technology demonstration programs, which are based on an integrating effort,undertaken by an ultimate user, to assemble and demonstrate a significant new militarycapability in a realistic environment, based on maturing advanced technologies, to clearlyestablish the capabilityõs military utility.5)5for more information, see http://www.acq.osd.mil/asc/.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.54a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization program3.3regarding program and contract managementto deal with the most important of the program management issues described in section2.3, the committee makes the following recommendations.category 1 recommendations on program management¥because testing is such a critical dimension of system development and deployment, thefbi must allow adequate time for testing before any it application (including the vcf) isdeployed, even if dates of initial operational capability are delayed. testing must include afull systems integration test and adequate scale, volume, and stress tests.¥evolution is an essential component of any large systemõs life cycle. future development contracts for user applications should be premised on the use of smallscale prototypesthat can be built rapidly and tested with user feedback before committing to largescale development. therefore, in future it applications development, particularly of largescale enduseroriented applications, procurement contracts should be conditioned on the developmentof smallscale prototypes that can be built rapidly and tested with user feedback before committing to largescale development.¥for it applications beyond the vcf, the fbi should exploit proven methodologies ofcontracting and contract management, including the use of detailed functional specifications,specific milestones, frequent contract reviews, and earnedvalue metrics. given the fbiõsproblems with the management of the trilogy program, the next contract review should focuson continuity and availability. contracts already in place should be renegotiated to includebest practices such as code escrow and supportservicelevel agreements to protect the fbiagainst operational failures that can adversely impact the availability of and support forproducts that the fbi will depend on. the fbi should consult with both other governmentagencies and the private sector to develop a set of best contracting practices before undertaking its next contract review.category 2 recommendations on program management¥the fbiõs contracting strategy should be tied to features of its enterprise architecture;e.g., it should identify opportunities for multiple, smaller contracts with welldefineddeliverables and major progress checkpoints. this strategy should also highlight areas inwhich the fbi requires inhouse or trusted technical expertise to define and manage keyconcepts that govern contracts and relationships between contractors. (this kind of information derives from the architectural triad described in section 2.1.1. for example, the systemarchitecture should define the major systems to be built. the technical architecture shoulddefine the key interfaces between systems that have to be carefully managed to get independently developed component systems to work together. in addition, the fbi should have inhouse expertise regarding operations as they relate to the overall infrastructure, whereas thefbi may be able to leave to contractors the expertise relevant to functionality in specificinstances and specific applications.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.recommendations553.4regarding human resourcesto deal with the most important of the skills issues described in section 2.4, the committeemakes the following recommendations.category 1 recommendations on human resources¥for trilogy and subsequent it projects to have access to the human talent they need tosucceed, the fbi must dramatically grow its own internal expertise in it and it contractmanagement as quickly as possible. to deal with human resource shortages in key areas (e.g.,program management, data architecture, data modeling, and data warehousing), the onlyfeasible shortterm fixes are to borrow experienced personnel from other agencies or to obtainassistance through a memorandum of understanding or agreement (mou/moa) from anothergovernment agency with substantial experience in the relevant matters. the expectationwould be that these arrangements would last for a couple of years, during which time the fbicould train permanent replacements in longterm career tracks with the fbi.note that this recommendation is still consistent with the notion of using outside expertise, when it is appropriate, as long as the fbi does not cede overall management and themaking of the key decisions. for example, the fbi could in principle outsource in a securefacility the daytoday operation of its information systems and thus conserve its scarce ittalent to work on matters more closely related to operations and strategy.¥because of their importance to the short and longterm success of the bureauõs itmodernization efforts, the fbi must permanently fill the positions of chief information officerand chief enterprise architect, and the committee concurs with the directorõs judgment thatfilling these positions with appropriately qualified individuals ought to have the highestpriority. at this writing (late march 2004), an acting cio and an acting chief technology officerhave been appointed. the appointment of these individuals is promising, and unverifiedreports suggest that they are committed to completing the enterprise architecture in a matterof months, although the committee underscores once again the need for the operationalmanagement to be heavily involved in the creation of the enterprise architecture.¥the fbi should develop an improved system for internally reviewing the state of progressin key it programs and for communicating relevant findings to key stakeholders, thus preempting the perceived need for and distraction of constant external investigations.category 2 recommendations on human resources¥the fbi should seek relief from excessively tight constraints on reprogramming allocated funds, or at least seek to streamline the approval process.3.5conclusionthe committee believes that the fbi has made significant progress in some areas of its itmodernization efforts, such as the modernization of the computing hardware and baselinesoftware and the deployment of its networking infrastructure. however, because the fbi itinfrastructure was so inadequate in the past, there is still an enormous gap between the fbiõscurrent it capabilities and the capabilities that are urgently needed.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.56a review of the fbiõs trilogy information technology modernization programthe committee has made recommendations that, if adopted, will significantly increase thelikelihood that the fbiõs trilogy it modernization program will enhance the fbiõs effectiveness in carrying out its critical crimefighting and counterterrorism missions. but it emphasizes the difference between a pro forma adoption of these recommendations and an adoptionof these recommendations that is both fully embraced throughout the agency and aggressivelyexecuted. the former may be the metric that auditing and oversight agencies and offices oftenuse in assessing agency performance, but it is the attitude and willingness of senior staff to actthat really count. the senior management of the fbi has a substantive and direct role to playin the fbiõs it modernization efforts. this role either has not been understood or it has beengiven a lower priority based on the perception of more immediate operational priorities.given the importance of it to the fbiõs future success in carrying out its missions, the fbiõssenior management must concern itself as much with developing a coherent vision for usingit to advance the bureauõs strategic view as with budgets, training programs, equipment, andorganization. as the complexities of the fbiõs evolving role are understood, the committeebelieves that investment by the fbiõs senior management team in the it process will yieldmajor enhancements to mission achievement as well as substantial operational efficiencies.a review of the fbi's trilogy information technology modernization programcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.57appendixshort
