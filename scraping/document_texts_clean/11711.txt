and society. but theu.s. position as a leader in telecommunications technology is now at risk because of the recentdecline in domestic support for longterm, fundamental telecommunications research. to helpunderstand this challenge, the national science foundation (nsf) asked the national research council to assess the current state of telecommunications research in the united states.this report provides an examination of telecommunications research support, focus, and timehorizon in industry and academia and discusses the implications for the health of the sector.finally, it presents recommendations for enhancing u.s. telecommunications research efforts.findingstelecommunications has expanded greatly over the past few decades from primarilylandline telephone service to the use of fiber optic, cable, and wireless connections offering awide range of voice, image, video, and data services. yet it is not a mature industry, and majorinnovation and changeñdriven by researchñcan be expected for many years to come.without an expanded investment in research, however, the nationõs position as a leader isat risk. strong competition is emerging from asian and european countries that are makingsubstantial investments in telecommunications r&d.for many telecommunications products and services that are now commodities, the unitedstates is at a competitive disadvantage compared with countries where the cost of doingbusiness is lower. continued u.s. strength in telecommunications, therefore, will require afocus on highvalue innovation that is made possible only by a greater emphasis on research.expansion of telecommunications research is also necessary to attract, train, and retain research talent.telecommunications research has yielded major benefits such as the internet, radio frequency wireless communications, optical networks, and voice over internet protocol. promisrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.2renewing u.s. telecommunications researching opportunities for future research include enhanced internet architectures, more trustworthy networks, and adaptive and cognitive wireless networks.nevertheless, research support has fallen off in recent years. prior to the restructuring ofthe telecommunications industry in 1984, the bell systemõs research labs played a dominantrole in longterm, fundamental telecommunications research for the united states. postrestructuring, industrial support for such research has declined, become more shortterm inscope, and become less stable. a diverse array of competing telecommunications firmsñtelephone, cable, internet, and wirelessñemerged, leaving most research to equipment vendors, which increasingly focused on shortterm goals. telecommunications research is increasingly being done at universities rather than by industry, and outside rather than insidethe united states. in addition, the diversity of players in todayõs telecommunications industrymakes it difficult to design and deploy major, endtoend innovations.federal funding of longterm research has not increased to cover the decline in industrysupport. no systematic efforts, such as took place for the semiconductor industry withsematech, have emerged. because the benefits of much telecommunications research cannot be appropriated by individual firms, therefore, public funding of such research appearsnecessary.the nsf and the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) have been thetwo primary sources of federal telecommunications r&d support. nsf, long a supporter oftelecommunications r&d spanning a range of topics, has recently been increasing its attentionto telecommunications r&d, with an emerging emphasis on new approaches to networking.darpa, which funded a number of important telecommunications advances in the past (including elements of the internet itself), has been shifting its emphasis toward more immediatemilitary needs and giving less attention to longterm telecommunications research.recommendationsa strong, effective telecommunications r&d program for the united states will require agreater role for governmentsponsored and university research, and more funding of longterm research by industry. the committee recommends that the federal government establisha new research organizationñthe advanced telecommunications research activity (atra)ñto stimulate and coordinate research across industry, academia, and government. atra wouldbe a hybrid of activities of the sort historically associated with darpa (which through thearpanet program managed a research portfolio, developed a vision, and convened industry and academia to build what would become the internet) and sematech (which broughtthe semiconductor industry together, initially with some federal support to complement industry dollars, to fund joint research, development, and roadmapping activities). there are anumber of options for where within the federal government such a program could fit, eachwith its own set of tradeoffs (see chapter 4). for example, atraõs proposed mission wouldalign with that of existing agencies within the department of commerce, and nsf has developed mechanisms for joint academicindustry engineering research, albeit more focused andon a smaller scale.the committee also recommends that all segments of the u.s. telecommunications industry increase their support for fundamental research, possibly taking advantage of the avenueprovided by participation in joint, cooperative research activities organized by atra. indeed,industry should provide a significant fraction of total r&d funding for atra, which wouldrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.executive summary3support researchers from academia and industry and provide industry with a way to poolfunds, spread risk, and share beneficial results.atraõs mission would be to (1) identify, coordinate, and fund u.s. telecommunicationsr&d; (2) foster major architectural advances; and (3) strengthen the u.s. telecommunications research capability. key suggested steps for implementing atra are (1) establishmentof mechanisms for carrying out projectbased research; (2) establishment of advisory committees with highlevel industry participation; (3) exploration of the need for r&d centers; and(4) establishment of a forum for key parties to discuss critical technology development issues.effective expansion of federal support of telecommunications research through atra willrequire participation from both service providers and equipment vendors to help identify themost critical research needs together with complementary industry investments in research.atra can play an important role in facilitating mechanisms to enable service providers topool research support.even with atra, nsf and darpa will remain important contributors to u.s. telecommunications research efforts. the committee recommends that nsf and darpa assess theirinvestments in basic telecommunications research and consider increasing both their emphasis on and their level of investment in such research. both should establish criteria for determining the appropriate level of telecommunications research funding. nsf should continue tostrengthen its support for telecommunications research and should consider programs forattracting and developing young research talent. to stay at the forefront, darpa shouldcontinue support of telecommunications research for military applications, even if there is thechance of commercial development of those technologies. in formulating its research programs, darpa should also consider the telecommunications capabilities of potential adversaries and the risk of dependence on foreign suppliers for key technologies.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.4renewing u.s. telecommunications research41the importance of telecommunications andtelecommunications researchhow important is telecommunications as an industry, and how important is telecommunications research to the overall health of that industry? underlying these questions are severalothers. how important is telecommunications to the u.s. economy and society? to whatextent are u.s. consumers likely to benefit directly from telecommunications research in termsof new products and services that enhance their lives or improve their effectiveness or productivity? how much scope for innovation is there left in telecommunications, or has telecommunications matured to the point that it is merely a commodity service or technology?the core findings of this studyñwhich are supported throughout this reportñare that thetelecommunications industry remains of crucial importance to the united states as a society,that a strong telecommunications research capability continues to be essential to the healthand competitiveness of this u.s. industry internationally, and that the health of this industrystrongly affects the u.s. economy in many ways.telecommunicationsñan evolving definitionbefore the emergence of the internet and other data networks, telecommunications had aclear meaning: the telephone (and earlier the telegraph) was an application of technology thatallowed people to communicate at a distance by voice (and earlier by encoded electronicsignals), and telephone service was provided by the public switched telephone network(pstn). much of the u.s. network was owned and operated by american telephone & telegraph (at&t); the rest consisted of smaller independent companies, including some servedby gte.then in the 1960s, facsimile and data services were overlaid on the pstn, adding theability to communicate documents and data at a distanceñapplications still considered telecommunications because they enabled new kinds of communication at a distance that werealso carried over the pstn. more recently, of course, communication at a distance has exrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the importance of telecommunications and telecommunications research5panded to include data transport, video conferencing, email, instant messaging, web browsing, and various forms of distributed collaboration, enabled by transmission media that havealso expanded (from traditional copper wires) to include microwave, terrestrial wireless, satellite, hybrid fiber/coaxial cable, and broadband fiber transport.today consumers think of telecommunications in terms of both products and services.starting with the carterphone decision by the federal communications commission in 1968,1it has become permissible and increasingly common for consumers to buy telecommunications applications or equipment as products as well as services. for example, a customerowned and customerinstalled wifi local area network may be the first access link supportinga voice over internet protocol (voip) service, and a consumer may purchase a voip softwarepackage and install it on his or her personally owned and operated personal computer thatconnects to the internet via an internet service provider.the technologies used for telecommunications have changed greatly over the last 50 years.empowered by research into semiconductors and digital electronics in the telecommunications industry, analog representations of voice, images, and video have been supplanted bydigital representations. the biggest consequence has been that all types of media can berepresented in the same basic form (i.e., as a stream of bits) and therefore handled uniformlywithin a common infrastructure (most commonly as internet protocol, or ip, data streams).subsequently, circuit switching was supplemented by, and will likely ultimately be supplantedby, packet switching. for example, telephony is now routinely carried at various places in thenetwork by the internet (using voip) and cable networks. just as the pstn is within the scopeof telecommunications, so also is an internet or cable tv network carrying a direct substitutetelephony application.perhaps the most fundamental change, both in terms of technology and its implications forindustry structure, has occurred in the architecture of telecommunications networks. architecture in this context refers to the functional description of the general structure of the systemas a whole and how the different parts of the system relate to each other. previously the pstn,cable, and data networks coexisted as separately owned and operated networks carryingdifferent types of communications, although they often shared a common technology base(such as pointtopoint digital communications) and some facilities (e.g., highspeed digitalpipes shared by different networks).how are the new networks different? first, they are integrated, meaning that all mediañbe they voice, audio, video, or datañare increasingly communicated over a single commonnetwork. this integration offers economies of scope and scale in both capital expenditures andoperational costs, and also allows different media to be mixed within common applications.as a result, both technology suppliers and service providers are increasingly in the business ofproviding telecommunications in all media simultaneously rather than specializing in a particular type such as voice, video, or data.second, the networks are built in layers, from the physical layer, which is concerned withthe mechanical, electrical and optical, and functional and procedural means for managingnetwork connections to the data, network, and transport layers, which are concerned withtransferring data, routing data across networks between addresses, and ensuring endtoend1see 13 f.c.c.2d 420 (1968).renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.6renewing u.s. telecommunications researchconnections and reliability of data transfer to the application layer, which is concerned withproviding a particular functionality using the network and with the interface to the user.2both technology (equipment and software) suppliers and service providers tend to specialize in one or two of these layers, each of which seeks to serve all applications and all media. asa consequence, creating a new application may require the participation and cooperation of aset of complementary layered capabilities. this structure results in a horizontal industry structure, quite distinct from the vertically integrated industry structure of the bell system era.all these changes suggest a new definition of telecommunications: telecommunications isthe suite of technologies, devices, equipment, facilities, networks, and applications that support communication at a distance.the range of telecommunications applications is broad and includes telephony and videoconferencing, facsimile, broadcast and interactive television, instant messaging, email, distributed collaboration, a host of web and internetbased communication, and data transmission.3 of course many if not most software applications communicate across the network insome fashion, even if it is for almost incidental purposes such as connecting to a license serveror downloading updates. deciding what is and is not telecommunications is always a judgment call. applications of information technology range from those involving almost no communication at all (word processing) to simple voice communications (telephony in itspurest and simplest form), with many gradations in between.as supported by the horizontally homogeneous layered infrastructure, applications ofvarious sorts increasingly incorporate telecommunications as only one capability among many.for example telephony, as it evolves into the internet world, is beginning to offer a host of newdatabased features and integrates other elements of collaboration (e.g., visual material ortools for collaborative authoring). another important trend is machinetomachine communication at a distance, and so it cannot be assumed that telecommunications applicationsexclusively involve people.the telecommunications industrylike telecommunications itself, the telecommunications industry is broader than it was inthe past. it encompasses multiple service providers, including telephone companies, cablesystem operators, internet service providers, wireless carriers, and satellite operators. theindustry today includes softwarebased applications with a communications emphasis andintermediate layers of software incorporated into endtoend communication services. it alsoincludes suppliers of telecommunications equipment and software products sold directly toconsumers and also to service providers, as well as the telecommunications service providers2the descriptions of layers were adapted from the open systems interconnect reference model (iso 74981),which provides a useful tool for conceptualizing network layersñsee <http://standards.iso.org/ittf/publiclyavailablestandards/s020269isoiec749811994(e).zip>.3the term òtelecommunicationsó takes on a particular significance with respect to the telecommunications actof 1996 and implementing regulations. the broad definition adopted here is intended solely to capture the scope ofrelevant research, not to make any statement about what technologies and services should or should not beconsidered telecommunications for regulatory purposes.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the importance of telecommunications and telecommunications research7themselves. it includes companies selling components or intellectual property predominatelyof a communication flavor, including integrated circuit chip sets for cell phones and cable anddigital subscriber line (dsl) modems.no longer a vertically integrated business, the telecommunications industry is enabled bya complex value chain that includes vendors, service providers, and users. the telecommunications value chain begins with building blocks such as semiconductor chips and software.these components are, in turn, incorporated into equipment and facilities that are purchasedby service providers and users. the service providers then, in turn, build networks in order tosell telecommunications services to end users. the end users include individuals subscribingto services like telephony (landline and cellular) and broadband internet access, companiesand organizations that contract for internal communications networks, and companies andorganizations that operate their own networks. some major enduser organizations also bypass service providers and buy, provision, and operate their own equipment and software,like a corporate local area network (lan) or a u.s. military battlefield information system.software suppliers participate at multiple points in the value chain, selling directly not only toequipment vendors but also to service providers (e.g., operational support systems) and toend users (e.g., various pcbased applications for communications using the internet).an implication of defining telecommunications broadly is that every layer involved incommunication at a distance becomes, at least partially, part of the telecommunications industry. the broad range and large number of companies that contribute to the telecommunications industry are evident in the following list of examples:¥networking service providers across the internet and the pstn, wireless carriers, and cableoperators. examples include at&t, comcast, verizon, and directv.¥communications equipment suppliers that are the primary suppliers to service providers.examples include cisco, lucent, and motorola.¥networking equipment suppliers selling products to enduser organizations and individuals. examples include ciscoõs linksys division and hewlettpackard (local area networkingproducts).¥semiconductor manufacturers, especially those supplying systemonachip solutions forthe telecommunications industry. examples include texas instruments, qualcomm, broadcom,and stmicroelectronics.¥suppliers of operating systems that include a networking stack. microsoft is an example.¥software suppliers, especially those selling infrastructure and applications incorporatingor based on realtime media. examples include ibm, realnetworks (streaming media), andbea (application servers).¥utility or ondemand service providers selling realtime communicationsoriented applications. examples include aol and microsoft (instant messaging) and webex (onlinemeetings).¥consumer electronics suppliers with communicationsoriented customerpremises equipment and handheld appliances. examples include motorola and nokia (cell phones), researchin motion (handheld email appliances), polycom (videoconferencing terminals), microsoftand sony (networked video games), and panasonic (televisions).what is striking about this list is how broad and inclusive it is. even though many of thesefirms do not specialize solely in telecommunications, it is now quite common for firms in therenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.8renewing u.s. telecommunications researchlarger domain of information technology to offer telecommunications products or to incorporate telecommunications capability into an increasing share of their products.the importance of telecommunicationstelecommunications and societythe societal importance of telecommunications is well accepted and broadly understood,reflected in its nearubiquitous penetration and use. noted below are some of the key areas ofimpact:¥telecommunications provides a technological foundation for societal communications. communication plays a central role in the fundamental operations of a societyñfrom business togovernment to families. in fact, communication among people is the essence of what distinguishes an organization, community, or society from a collection of individuals. communicationñfrom web browsing to cell phone calling to instant messagingñhas become increasingly integrated into how we work, play, and live.¥telecommunications enables participation and development. telecommunications plays anincreasingly vital role in enabling the participation and development of people in communities and nations disadvantaged by geography, whether in rural areas in the united states or indeveloping nations in the global society and economy.¥telecommunications provides vital infrastructure for national security. from natural disasterrecovery, to homeland security, to communication of vital intelligence, to continued militarysuperiority, telecommunications plays a pivotal role. when the issue is countering an adversary, it is essential not only to preserve telecommunications capability, but also to have asuperior capability. there are potential risks associated with a reliance on overseas sources forinnovation, technologies, applications, and services.it is difficult to predict the future impact of telecommunications technologies, services, andapplications that have not yet been invented. for example, in the early days of research anddevelopment into the internet in the late 1960s, who could have foreseen the full impact of theinternetõs widespread use today?telecommunications and the u.s. economythe telecommunications industry is a major direct contributor to u.s. economic activity.the u.s. census bureau estimates that just over 3 percent of the u.s. gross domestic income(gdi) in 2003 was from communications services (2.6 percent) and communications hardware(0.4 percent)ñcategories that are narrower than the broad definition of telecommunicationsoffered above. at 3 percent, telecommunications thus represented more than a third of thetotal fraction of gdi spent on information technology (it; 7.9 percent of gdi) in 2003. in fact,the fraction attributable to telecommunications is probably larger relative to that of it thanthese figures suggest, given that much of the gdi from it hardware (particularly semiconductors) could apply to any of several industries (computing, telecommunications, media, andelectronics, for example). if one assumes it to be the sum of computers (calculating), computers (wholesale), computers (retail), and software and services, the total gdi for it isrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the importance of telecommunications and telecommunications research9$440 billion, compared to the total for telecommunications (communications hardware pluscommunications services) of $335 billion, making telecommunicationsõ contribution to gdijust under 80 percent of itõs contribution to gdi.4the telecommunicationsrelated industries are also a major employerñcommunicationsservices employed 1 million u.s. workers in 2002, representing 1.1 percent of the total privateworkforce, and communications equipment companies employed nearly 250,000 people.5moreover, telecommunications is a hightech sector, with many highly skilled employees.telecommunications is a growth business. although markedly reduced investment insome parts of the sector (following the bubble years of the late 1990s) may have given animpression of low growth in the long run, a longerterm view taking into account the need forhumans and machines to communicate suggests that telecommunications will continue togrow apace, as evidenced by the ongoing expansion of wireless and broadband access servicesthroughout the world.telecommunications is also a key enabler of productivity across the u.s. economy andsociety.6 not only is telecommunications an industry in itself, but it also benefits nearly everyother industry. in the 1990s the u.s. gdp grew rapidly, and the u.s. economy was among thestrongest in the world. it is widely believed that the internet economy played a significant rolein this success.today, however, new wireless applications, lowcost manufacturing innovations,and handset design are some of the areas in which the asian countries are outinvesting theunited states in r&d and are seeing resulting bottomline impacts to their economies. forthe united states to compete in the global marketplaceñacross industriesñit needs the productivity that comes from enhancements in telecommunications. if the telecommunicationsinfrastructure in the united states were to fall significantly behind that of the rest of theworld, the global competitiveness of all other u.s. industries would be affected. conversely,the growth in u.s. productivity has been based in part on a telecommunications infrastructurethat is the most advanced in the world.u.s. leadership in telecommunications did not come by accidentñsuccess at the physical,network, and applications levels was made possible by the u.s. investment in decades ofresearch and the concomitant development of u.s. research leadership in

other industries in which the united stateshas important competitive advantages and a positive balance of trade, such as financial services and entertainment (e.g., movies and music).finally, telecommunications is an important component of the broader it industry, whichis sometimes viewed as having three technology legs:7 processing (to transform or changeinformation), storage (to allow communication of information from one time to another), andcommunications (to transmit information from one place to another). the boundaries between these areas are not very distinct, but this decomposition helps illustrate the breadth ofit and the role that telecommunications plays. increasingly it systems must incorporate allthree elements to different degrees,8 and it is increasingly common for companies in anysector of it to offer products with a communications component, and often with a communications emphasis. the it industryõs overall strength depends on strength across communications, processing, and storage as well as strength in all layers of technologyñfrom the physical layer (including communications hardware, microprocessors, and magnetic and opticalstorage), to the software infrastructure layers (operating systems and web services), to software applications.telecommunications and global competitivenessin this era of globalization, many companies are multinational, with operationsñincluding r&dñconducted across the globe. for example, ibm, hp, qualcomm, and microsoft allhave research facilities in other countries, and many european and asian companies haveresearch laboratories in the united states. increasing numbers of businesses compete globally.every company and every industry must assess the segments and niches in which it operatesto remain globally competitive.both asian and european nations are continuing to pursue strategies that exploit perceived u.s. weakness in telecommunications and telecommunications research as a way ofimproving their competitiveness in telecommunications, as well as in information technologymore broadly. leapfrogging the united states in telecommunications has, in the opinion of thecommittee, been an explicit and stated strategy for a number of asian (in broadband andwireless) and european (in wireless) nations for the past decade, with notable success. theseefforts have aimed to stimulate the rapid penetration of physicallayer technologies for residential access (broadband access, especially in asia) and wireless and mobile access (cellularnetworks, especially in europe).the importance

more complex than can be reasonably characterized by the diagramñbut figure 1.1 does provide a realistic view of the impacts of research.shown at the top of figure 1.1 is the research enabled by available funding. level 1 showsthe direct results: researchers conduct exploratory studies, achieving technical breakthroughsand developing their expertise and their basic understanding of the areas

results begin to fit together. the university talent generated in level 1develops competenceñnot simply lowlevel job skills that can be easily transported anywhere, but rather the nextgeneration expertise needed to ensure a skilled u.s. telecommunications workforce. the united states has access to this skilled workforce first and can thusbenefit directly from the talent and knowledge base

competence to understand the new technology, the availability ofthe technology, and shared goals are the ingredients required to create a healthy telecommunications industry and, more broadly, a capable telecommunications infrastructure.interestingly, not all of the research performed affects telecommunications alone. becausetelecommunications touches multiple industries, the technology base it provides also oftenenables the creation of entirely new industries. the success of the ipod and other portabledigital music players, for example, rests in part on earlier telecommunicationsinspired workon how to compress audio for efficient transmission over limitedbandwidth channels.at level 4, an indirect benefit of research is a telecommunications infrastructure thatprovides advantages to all industries that use telecommunications. there are also enduser orconsumer benefits that accrue to having an outstanding infrastructure, such as enhancededucation, entertainment, and personal convenience. finally, new companies also emergefrom these new industries.level 5 aggregates the key benefits of research in broad areas of national concern. concerning economic impact, the strong telecommunications industry, new spinoff industries, andmore competitive industries (across the board) result in a higher gdp for the country, as wellas job creation. technological leadership and economic strength also help ensure strong leadership and capability in national defense and homeland security.the full benefits of the process depicted in figure 1.1 develop over an extended period oftime, with a longterm buildup over several years between the seed investments in researchand realization of the ultimate bottomline benefits. each step takes time: from innovation tomass deployment and impact. investments by both government and industry in research byacademia and industry lead to both short and longterm contributions.over the years, cstb studies have documented this phenomenon across multiple areas ofinformation technology and telecommunications research. in particular, its 1995 report evolving the high performance computing and communications initiative to support the nationõs information infrastructure9 and a 2003 update10 illustrate how longterm investments in research acrossacademia and industry have led to the creation of many new, important u.s. industry segments with revenues that came to exceed $1 billion.in closing, it is worth noting the perils of losing leadership in telecommunications. becauseof the time lag, the nation may continue to exhibit leadership at levels 4 and 5 (and possiblylevel 3) even as it is failing to renew capability at levels 1 and 2. since levels 3 through 5 aremost visible to policy makers and the public, there is a potential to perceive the situation asless dire than it really is. if levels 1 and 2 are left to atrophy, serious problems will occur atlevels 3 through 5. if that happens, then recovery will take a long timeñor even proveimpossible.9computer science and telecommunications board, national research council, evolving the high performancecomputing and communications initiative to support the

industry and effects on research13132the evolution of the u.s. telecommunicationsindustry and effects on researchthe structure of the u.s. telecommunications industry has changed dramatically overrecent decades, with consequences for research. major changes over the past several decadeshave included the breakup of the bell system, especially the 1984 divestiture, the 1995 creationof lucent technologies, and the advent of longhaul competitors such as mci and sprint; thetransformation of cable system operators into telecommunications providers as they adoptedthe hybrid fiber/coaxial cable digital architecture, which supports digital, highcapacity, twoway communications; the development and mainstream adoption of the internet, includingthe rise of a whole new class of industry players (e.g., cisco, microsoft, google, and so on); andthe creation and growth of a competitive wireless services market resulting in broad penetration of cellular voice and data services.these changes have yielded many benefits, including a much broader array of telecommunications services, a more diversified and competitive market, and an environment in whichnew innovations move more quickly to the marketplace. but they have also led to decreasedindustry support for longterm telecommunications research and a general shift in researchfocus from the long term to the short term. as has been observed by many others, there hasbeen an overall downturn in many areas of u.s. industry research.1 along similar lines, areport released earlier this year by the national academies concluded that the nationõs commitment to basic research in science and engineering needs to be sustained and strengthened.2the full impact of these trends on longterm telecommunications research is probably notyet evident, as the industry continues to exploit fundamental knowledge gained over the past1this phenomenon is not new. see, for example, rosenbloom et al., engines of innovation, harvard businessschool

investment in fundamental,longterm telecommunications research, the united states will eventually consume its ownintellectual òseed cornó and thus run out of new ideas within the next decade or perhaps evensooner. chapter 3 examines further some of the implications of curtailed research investment.bell system research and consequences of thebell systemõs breakupfor roughly a century, the u.s. telecommunications infrastructure was largely defined bythe bell system, a telephony monopoly regulated under a series of consent decrees that gave itthe right to operate, maintain, and expand the u.s. telephone system. the chief research anddevelopment arm of the bell system, bell laboratories, was created in 1925, following demonstration in 1915 of the feasibility of coasttocoast longdistance service and realization of theimportance of a viable research and development laboratory to effective deployment. successful nationwide implementation of longdistance service required, for example, a device withsufficient gain to offset the signal losses in the 3000mile stretch of the u.s. transcontinentalcable. the development of the vacuum tube amplifier for use in telephone circuits, whichstarted in the 1910s, took many years of fundamental research and required extremely closecooperation between the research community that had originally invented the vacuum tubetechnology and the development community that introduced the vacuum tube amplifier intothe telephone network.bell laboratories relied heavily on managers who understood the benefits to the company(and society) of fundamental research and were able to provide a work environment thatfostered worldclass research in virtually every aspect of telecommunications technology.stable funding for research was provided via a tax levied on the service revenues of most ofthe bell operating companies, an approach approved by state regulators. the revenue from theservices tax was more than sufficient to fund unfettered investigations over almost 6 decadesinto almost every aspect of telecommunications, from basic materials (and the associatedphysics and chemistry) to largescale computing and networking platforms and systems. overtime, bell laboratoriesõ support for basic science and engineering led to major advances intelephony spanning terminals, switching, transmission, services, and operations. out of thebell system research program also came many worldfamous innovations, including the transistor, information theory, the laser, the solar cell, communications satellites, and fiberopticcommunications. perhaps the most notable benefit of the research was the creation of thesemiconductor industry as a result of the mandatory public licensing of bellõs patent for thetransistor. in addition, research in basic science at bell labs was recognized by six nobelprizes for strides in quantum mechanics, solidstate physics, and radio astronomy.a number of other companies were also involved at the time in developing new telecommunications technologies and equipment. the work of companies like gte automatic electric, trw vidar, and northern telecom, along with bellõs own western electric, pushedtelephony forward through advances in handset design and digital switching, for example.bell labs also served as an important nucleus for the broader telecommunications researchcommunity: in the predivestiture era, university researchers and telecommunications research leaders from around the world commonly spent summers or sabbaticals at bell labs,where they could conduct exploratory research that could not have been undertaken elsewhere.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the evolution of the u.s. telecommunications industry and effects on research15despite its many successes, there were many criticisms of the predivestiture regulatedmonopoly (and this report is certainly not calling for a return to the bell system structure). forinstance, until government actions forced a change, the bell system prohibited the attachmentof thirdparty equipment on customer premises, which many viewed as stifling innovation.monopoly status also meant that there were few pressures on the bell system for rapid innovation in its services, and a number of innovative technologies developed by bell labs eitherwere not adopted or were adopted very slowly.divestiture and its effectsthe bell system ended in 1983. divestiture resulted in the separation of the local bellsystem operating companies (which provided local telephone service to large regions of theunited states) from the longdistance parts of the network (known as longlines communications) and ended the license fee arrangement through which the regional operating companiessupported bell labs. at the time of the separation, western electric (the equipment manufacturing part of the bell system) was assigned to the part of the company that would be calledat&t), along with most of the research and development resources of bell labs. the regionalbell operating companies (rbocs), the providers of local phone service, formed an r&dconsortium called bellcore (bell communications research, later renamed telcordia technologies) and agreed to fund bellcore to do the majority of the r&d needed to support themñat least for an initial period on the order of 5 to 7 years. subsequently the rbocs sold bellcoreto saic, causing the new lab to seek support outside the rbocs and subsequently makeradical changes in the scope and direction of its research program.as a result of divestiture, the fundamental split in the bell system propelled at&t (and itsr&d arm bell labs) into a competitive landscape for the first time, with aggressive competitors such as mci and sprint seeking to compete for longdistance servicesñfor both residential and business customers. thus although a tax on telecommunications revenue remained asa source for funding r&d at bell labs, the prospects for increased competition, lower telecommunications prices, and decreasing telecommunications revenues for at&t, as well as theregulatory pressures to lose market share to new competitors, led to the beginning of thereduction in the longterm, unfettered, fundamental research done at bell labs. additionally,divestiture marked the beginning of a process of transforming the telecommunications industry in the united states from a vertically organized structure (where one body, the bell system,had control over every aspect of the telecommunications process, from components, to boards,to systems, to services, to operations) to a horizontally organized structure (where multiplecompetitors existed at every level of the hierarchy and where no single entity had full responsibility for the network architecture, endtoend network operations, or longterm fundamental research that would enable the creation of an evolutionary path into the future).subsequent splits and spinoffs and research cutbacksthe second stage of the breakup of the bell system occurred at the end of 1995 when theexisting at&t (which had acquired the computer services company ncr several years earlier) made the decision to divest both the computer operations part of the business (selling itback to ncr) and the equipment manufacturing part of the business (with the creation oflucent technologies) in order to compete more actively in the areas of wireless and cablerenewing u.s.

resources of bell labs (as well asthe rights to use of the bell labs name) went to lucent technologies for research and development in support of the creation of new products. about onefourth of the research componentof bell labs (along with significant development resources) joined at&t and formed at&tlabs, with the goal of conducting research and development that would be most appropriateto a services company that was venturing into the areas of wireless and broadband communication services.former bell system entities continued to evolve. over time lucent technologies spun offthe component manufacturing part of the company as agere labs and the enterprise businesssystems part of the company as avaya labs. telcordia was acquired by saic and later purchased by two private equity firms. at&t spun off the wireless services part of the business(as at&t wireless, subsequently acquired by cingular in 2004) and sold the cable servicespart to comcast communications. sbc and at&t then merged in early 2005 under the at&tname. early 2006 saw a proposed acquisition by at&t of bell south.it initially appeared as though research might continue to grow and prosper within theformer bell family laboratoriesñlucent bell labs, bellcore research, the new at&t labs,agere labs, and avaya labsñas well as within new telecommunications firms. indeed, figures gathered by michael noll showed that the number of former bell family company researchers grew from about 1000 in 1960 to 1200 in 1981 to about 1920 in 1997, but then fell offto 1570 in 2001. data reported by noll on research and development expenditures by the bellfamily companies showed significant growth from 1981 ($3.2 billion) to 2001 ($6 billion).3one of the bell system offshoots, lucent, continued to make a significant commitment toresearch, albeit one that decreased in total dollar terms as lucent shrank. it has continued tofund bell laboratories at a rate of roughly 1 percent of revenue, further supplemented by somesupport from government research and development contracts. that allocation of 1 percent,which might be viewed as a best practice for a large equipment vendor, funds a mix ofresearch in basic sciences, exploration of disruptive technologies, and more incremental workfor meeting current customer needs.the emergence of new telecommunications playerscable the cable industry began in the 1940s and 1950s as a way to get television signals intoremote areas. antennas were placed in advantageous locations (e.g., the top of a mountain)and the signals were distributed along coaxial cable lines to local homes. as cable systemsgrew in size and number, and in the types of signals or services they provided, a fullfledged,widereaching industry began to take shape. according to the national cable and telecommunications association (ncta), by 1962 there were already nearly 800 cable systems withalmost 900,000 subscribers in the united states.43a. michael noll, òtelecommunication basic research:

industry and effects on research17a good deal of organized, focused research and development work has enabled the evolution of cable as a telecommunications industry. in the late 1980s a group of cable companyexecutives formed cablelabs, a nonprofit consortium of cable system operators, to pursuenew cable telecommunications technologies, improve the business capabilities of cable operators, and help cable companies develop and take advantage of new technologies. for example,cablelabs was involved in the development and specification of cable modem technology(work initially funded by mcns holdingsñcomposed of tci, time warner cable, cox, andcomcast), eventually administering the specifications and performing certification and qualification of products. in addition, the early 1990s saw cablelabs involved in developing fiberoptic trunking and work to develop fiberoptic regional rings to link individual municipalcable systems. this work drew on earlier, more fundamental telecommunications research,such as work on fiberoptic communications, that had been developed at such places as belllabs. cablelabs work cuts across the layers from device and equipment standards throughapplications.cablelabsñwhile not doing fundamental research itselfñcontinues to play other important roles for the cable industry, such as helping to facilitate specification development, providing testing facilities to ensure quality equipment, and generally serving as a clearinghousefor information on current and prospective technological advances. more recently, cablelabshas been involved in the development of highdefinition television systems, voip packetnetworking, interoperable interface specifications for realtime multimedia, and standards tocreate a common platform for interactive services.5,6the internetin the early 1960s, the vision for a research program aimed at networking computers tookshape at the defense departmentõs advanced research projects agency (arpa, later darpa).as early as 1965, arpa was sponsoring research into cooperative timesharing computers andpacket switching. plans for the arpanet began to take shape in 1966, and in 1968 darpaawarded a key contract to bolt beranek and newman inc. (bbn) to produce a key componentin implementing the network, interface message processors (or imps). a year later, the firstnodes in the arpanet became active, allowing research in hosttohost protocols and howbest to utilize network resources. by 1971, the arpanet included 15 nodes, and work wasunderway on email. as noted in an earlier cstb report, however, the arpanet was notdarpaõs only networking research activityñthe organization also supported related researchon terrestrial and satellite packet radio networks.75the committee received a briefing from cablelabsõ david reed at a meeting in washington, d.c., on nov. 3,2003. for more information about cablelabs and its history, see cable television laboratories inc., òa decade ofinnovation: the history of cablelabs 19881998,ó 1998, available online at <http://www.cablelabs.com/about/overview/history.html>.6more general information regarding the development of the cable industry is available from the following tworesources: congressional research service, òcable television: background and overview of rates and otherissues for congressó (rs21775), 2004, available online at <http://www.opencrs.com/rpts/rs2177520040405.pdf>;and fcc, òevolution of cable television,ó 2000, available online at <http://www.fcc. gov/mb/facts/csgen.html>.7computer science and telecommunications board, national research council, funding a revolution: government support for computing research, national academy press, washington, d.c., 1999, available online at<http://newton.nap.edu/html/far/>, p. 174.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.18renewing u.s. telecommunications researchother key darpafunded work concerned the protocols used for communicating over thenetwork. as work progressed on the arpanet, it became clear that a replacement for theoriginal network control protocol would be needed to address the vision of an open architecture enabling a network of networks, a concept that called for a different approach to disseminating information, ensuring interoperability, and dealing with errors and transmission quality. the early 1980s saw the adoption of transmission control protocol/internet protocol(tcp/ip) as a defense department standard, and the cutover of the arpanet to the newprotocol. darpa not only funded and managed a research portfolio; it also facilitated thedevelopment of a vision and served as a convener for industry and academia, notably throughthe internet engineering task force.the internetõs development continued with the spinoff of milnet to support dod operations and new missionfocused computer networks developed by the department of energy, nasa, and nsf, together with broader networks such as usenet and bitnet. in 1986,nsf launched its nsfnet program, an effort to link (among other things) a number of u.s.academic supercomputing centers.8 nsfnet was envisioned as a general highspeed networkthat could link many other academic or research networks (including the arpanet) usingthe research results and operational experience obtained from arpanet. the nsfnet provedvery successful. its upgrade to handle growing demand and other subsequent changes openedthe door for the participation of the private sector in the network.9the mid to late 1980s saw continuing darpasupported research and development inareas such as routers and their protocols. meanwhile, the speed of the nsfnetõs backbone sawgreat improvement, and the domain name system, a critical component facilitating internetgrowth and reliability, was introduced. nsf support was also critical to the development ofthe first widely used graphical web browser, mosaic, which was developed in 1993 by aresearcher at the national center for supercomputing applications.the internet was highly successful in meeting the original vision of enabling computers tocommunicate across diverse networks and in the face of heterogeneous underlying communications technologies.10 its successñmeasured in terms of commercial investment, wide use,and large installed baseñis also widely understood to have made innovation in the internetmuch harder over time.

foundation.cellular and wirelessin the early 1970s, following years of resistance to the idea, the federal communicationscommission (fcc) began setting aside a range of radio frequencies for radio telephony. nearthe end of that decade, a trial of cellular phone technology had been conducted in chicago,and the worldõs first commercial cellular phone service was introduced in tokyo, japan.by the early 1980s, the fcc was issuing wireless telephony licenses and setting up metropolitan and rural jurisdictions (socalled metropolitan statistical areas and rural service areas),and, by the middle of the decade, firstgeneration wireless systems were being deployed in theunited states. these systems were based on analog cellular technology using the advancedmobile phone system (or amps) technology that had been developed by bell labs. cellulartechnology was being deployed in other countries, as well, although the technology andstandards adopted internationally were very different from those used in the united states.thus began one of todayõs most vibrant and competitive industriesñcompetition among wireless providers in todayõs market is fierce, and new products and services emerge almost on adaily basis now.growing consumer demand and the need to make better use of available spectrum resources fueled the development of a second generation of wireless technologies (also commonly referred to as 2g technologies). this second generation marked the transition to a fullydigital technology, providing enhanced quality and enabling better use of spectrum resources.while the european wireless industry settled on global system for mobile communications(gsm) for its 2g standard, two major wireless standards emerged in the united states: timedivision multiple access (tdma), a technology standard adopted by the telecommunicationsindustry association in 1989; and code division multiple access (cdma), a newer, competingtechnology developed and championed by qualcomm. 2g technology included many improvements over firstgeneration technology; for example, 2g included such advanced digitalfeatures as compression, network control techniques, bandwidth conservation measures, andfull support for voice mail.the next generation of wireless technology (socalled 3g technology) promises to addeven greater speed, capacity, and servicesñindeed, one recent report describes 3g as òbringing internet capabilities to wireless mobile phones.ó12 along the way to 3g, there has alsobeen a good deal of work on 2.5g technologies (e.g., cdma2000, 1xrtt, and gprs) to helpbridge the fairly large gap between 2g and 3g, as well as to build out the networks andinfrastructure required by the newer technologies.12linda k. moore, congressional research service, wireless

investmentone result of the divestiture of the bell system, subsequent splits and spinoffs, and theentry of new types of telecommunications services providers was a much more competitivetelecommunications industry. the costñand retail priceñof longdistance calls fell rapidlybetween 1984 (the initial divestiture) and 2004 (when carriers began offering voice over ipservice broadly to consumers). wireless telephony grew rapidly, reaching nearly 208 millionaccounts in the united states by the end of 2005.13 broadband access to the internet becamewidely available. cable system operators started introducing their own local telephone services over their new digital, twoway infrastructure. business data service prices fell steadilyas well.a consequence of increased competition at every level of the telecommunications valuechain was that the industry players found themselves operating with tighter margins andlower revenues.the 1996 telecommunications act and subsequent fcc decisions led to a further evolution of the regulatory environment. the impact of these developments on innovation andr&dñand on the industry more broadlyñhas been the subject of much debate. some caution,for example, that such policies as unbundling and the use of total element longrun incremental costs in the regulation of incumbent local exchange carriers had the effect of dampeninginvestment by the local exchange carriers because competitors could appropriate some of theinvestment made by the carriers. others cite significant benefits of these policies to the consumer (reduced prices) and the market (lower barriers to market entry).from about 1990 to 2000, the period of high growth in the telecommunications industrymeant that there were sufficient revenues to attract many new entrants into the telecommunications market, each of which invested heavily in creating new network facilities. this timeperiod also saw venture capital play a more prominent role in

continuing ata pace comparable to that of the bell system prior to divestiture. but once this large buildouthad been completed, and as the internet bubble popped, investment declined significantly.reductions with the bursting of the internet bubblewhen the socalled internet bubble burst at the end of the 20th century, much of thetelecommunications industry was faced with a glut of infrastructure investments as the demand for these facilities slowed, leading to wholesale failures of major companies throughoutthe industry. during the boom years, companies had accumulated debt on the order of severaltrillion dollars across all players in the industry and suddenly had to service the debt withrapidly decreasing revenues. a result was widescale layoffs of workers, failures of severalmajor telecommunications players, and drastic reductions in capital spending by carriers,13ctia, wireless quick facts, april 2006, available online at

telecommunications industry has been a major shift frombasic, highmargin, wireline telephony services provided by the public switched telephonenetwork (pstn) to wireless and broadband services that both complement and compete withthe traditional services and are associated with lower margins.14 as a result, revenue is shiftingbox 2.1 the role of venture capital in innovation and researchalthough it is sometimes argued that the venture capital invested in industry is supplantingtraditional mechanisms for achieving innovation, venture capital represents development funding, not research funding. leadingedge developers that have a profit requirement will quicklycurtail their research directions in favor of achieving corporate financial goals. moreover, thesurge in funding that peaked in 2000 has fallen off almost as quickly as it appeared. totaltelecommunications venture funding peaked at nearly $5 billion in the second quarter of 2000before dropping back down to roughly $560 million per quarter just 2 years laterña level that hasremained fairly constant into 2006.1despite venture capitalõs important role in the u.s. innovation system and its many contributions to u.s. leadership in high technology, including telecommunications, its role is not to supplythe basic and applied r&d that has fueled many of the major telecommunications advancesmentioned in this report and elsewhere. instead, it seeks to fund specific product innovation thatcan deliver shortterm returns. venture capital funds typically have a lifetime of 5 to 7 years, andinvestors seek significant commercial returns in that time frame. in contrast, major telecommunication advances can require longerterm efforts often continuing for a decade or more andrequiring risktaking, broadbased, interdisciplinary, multifaceted supportñsuch as that historically provided by the bell system or provided today when federal agencies fund longterm academic research. over the long term, the venture capital model itself depends heavily on beingable to select promising areas for investment from a stream of results from longterm research.1according to data available from pricewaterhousecoopers. see

mci, and sprint) to wireless and broadband access serviceproviders (e.g., comcast, timewarner, aol, cingular, verizon wireless, tmobile, and sprintpcs). unfortunately almost none of the wireless or broadband service providers have beenfunding longterm research, nor are there indications at present that any will undertake to doso in the foreseeable future.increased emphasis on vendorsõ role in supporting researchall of the participants in the telecommunications value chain could, in principle, invest inresearch, but the nature of those investments would likely differ because of varying motivations and incentives. traditionally, investments in research by end users (the demand side)15seeking to improve the technologies available from providers and vendors (the supply side)have been the primary source of fundamental and longtimehorizon results that are muchmore likely to enter the public domain, making them available to all and increasing theirimpact. open access to such results is particularly important for telecommunications, giventhat the value of a communications network grows with the number of its users, with morewidely adopted and standardized technologies bringing greater benefits to all users.as a result of the structural changes in the telecommunications industry, the source offunds for investing in research has shifted from the demand sideñtelephone customers whopaid for bell system research via a tax on telephony usageñto the vendors of equipment,software, and chips, although the u.s. military (through darpa, the army, the navy, and theair force) continues to be a major source of investment in telecommunications research.currently, enduser organizations and commercial intermediaries are investing very little inresearch (an exception is at&t, which has maintained a vestige of bell labs but has cut thatback substantially, due to dramatic reductions in traditional telecommunications revenuesover the past 3 years, from a support level of close to $140 million in 2001 to a support level ofbelow $60 million in 2004).today, for commercial technologies, most of the investment is made by supplyside equipment vendors and semiconductor and software companies. service providers and equipmentvendors primarily support research leading to nearterm incremental additions to their ownproducts and services, and are likely to keep the results of their shortterm research programsproprietary in the interest of gaining competitive advantage.although demandside entities are generally more likely to direct their research investments toward more fundamental and longtimehorizon opportunities, a major economic impediment to doing so is socalled freeriding. since the goal of a demandside entity is typicallynot to gain proprietary advantage, but to make innovative solutions available through thetotality of its suppliers, demandside investments in research usually benefit everybody, thatis, all suppliers and other demandside entities. thus, companies or entities failing to invest inresearch can still benefit from the investments of others, and there is a temptation to gain a freeride on those investmentsñand a disincentive to invest in results that become largely a publicgood.15for more perspective on usercentered innovation, see eric von hippel, democratizing innovation, mit press,cambridge, mass., 2005,

telecommunications industry and effects on research23the problem of freeriding is not new. predivestiture, nonbell telephone companies likemci and worldcomñbut with the notable exception of gteñinvested little in research.other areas of telecommunications such as cable television, which was able to exploit opticaltransmission technologies for its new hybrid fibercoaxial cable deployments in the 1990s,similarly depended on and benefited from new technologies arising from bell labs and fromgovernmentsponsored research. today this trend has been accentuated as the fragments ofthe divested bell system have greatly curtailed or eliminated research investments, especiallythose targeted at advancing the general telecommunications technologies available throughtheir suppliers.another increasingly used mechanism or trend involves larger companies acquiringsmaller innovative startups (perhaps in lieu of funding or otherwise supporting inhouseresearch and development work) to stimulate their own growth and innovation. while thistrend does seem more oriented toward shortterm goals, it underscores the importance ofearly support or funding for the often highrisk research and development that contribute tothe creation of these smaller spinoff companies.moving responsibility for research to suppliers increases the volatility of funding. thecapital expenditures of service providers are dependent on the rate of change of their revenues, which can fluctuate rapidly, often owing to cyclical technology changes. for example,recent years have seen a sharp downturn in traditional wireline telephony revenues andpurchases of new equipment by carriers. sustaining a highquality research organization requires stable funding, and volatility and uncertainty can have significant consequences. forexample, in recent years, a number of prominent researchers have moved from industryresearch laboratories to universities as they seek a more stable environment in which to conduct their research.the decreasing time horizon of researchthe decline in attention to longterm research is quite evident when looking at the historyof bell labs, the institution that for decades was most closely associated with longterm telecommunications research. longterm research supported advances in areas such as switching,transmission, and services, and shorterterm research was aimed at operating and improvingexisting technologies and systems. although most of the system building and systems engineering and integration were done by developers and system architects, researchers weretraditionally heavily involved in the process since they were the ones who had created thefundamental technology on which the new systems were based.it has become clear that even as the number of researchers was growing in the late 1990s,the former bell family research enterprise was undergoing significant changes. because internal corporate management decisions about research and development are proprietary anddetailed historical data were not maintained, quantifying this shift is very difficult. however,testimony to the committee and comments received from a number of researchers clearlyindicate a qualitative shift in the time horizon for research. longterm, fundamental researchaimed at breakthroughs has declined in favor of shorterterm, incremental and evolutionaryprojects whose purpose is to enable improvements in existing products and services. thisevolutionary work is aimed at generating returns within a couple of years to a couple ofmonths and not at addressing the needs of the telecommunications industry as a whole infuture decades. insiders and outsiders have observed in comments to the committee that therenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.24renewing u.s. telecommunications researchfocus of 80 to 90 percent of research at the bell family labs is now concentrated on shortterminnovation rather than longterm fundamental research. although a closer alignment of theinterests of research laboratories and companies benefits u.s. industry, the often associatedreduction in fundamental, longterm research hurts the telecommunications industry in thelong run.decline in industry participation in publishing researchadditional evidence for the decline in research spending and the shift from longer toshorterterm research in the u.s. telecommunications industry is seen in the number of technical papers authored by industry researchers. at two recent major international conferencesheld annually in the field of communications (which represent at least part of the telecommunications landscape), there was a dramatic decrease in the number of conference papersauthored by industry researchers. table 2.1 lists the sources of the 1352 papers presented at the2005 international conference on communications (icc) and the 2005 ieee global telecommunications conference (globecom). only a handful of u.s. industry research labs were represented by more than one paper at the two conferences (see table 2.2).although it could be the case that u.s. telecommunications companies have decided torestrict presentations of work by their researchers (and developers) at such conferences, thecommittee considers it much more likely that the statistics on publication by author affiliationshown in tables 2.1 and 2.2 do reflect a dramatic decline in industry efforts in longtermresearch.16a decline in publication by industry authors is also suggested by the decreasing fraction ofindustryresearcherauthored papers in the ieee transactions on communications (figure 2.1),table 2.1 sources of papers presented at the 2005

communications area. in 1970 approximately 70percent of the papers in the transactions were authored by industry; in 2003 that percentagehad fallen by an order of magnitude to about 7 percent. the reduced contributions fromindustry have been partially offset by an increase in the number of academic papersñbothfrom u.s. and foreign universities.u.s. participation in publishing researchit can also be seen that publications from universities outside the united states are greaterin number than publications from universities within the united statesñalbeit by a smallamount. in addition, the level of publication from industry outside the united states is nowroughly the same as the level from u.s. industry.within u.s. universities, there are multiple indications that much u.s. academic researchin telecommunications is being carried out by foreign national graduate students. in the papers published in globecom 2005, 459 of the 675 authors from u.s. universities (68 percent)have apparently asian surnames. this observation is consistent with data showing thatroughly 60 percent of the ph.d.s in engineering and 50 percent of the ph.d.s in computerscience awarded in the united states are being awarded to nonu.s. citizens.17government support for telecommunications researchoverall investmentgovernment support for telecommunications research has been small compared with support for other areas of it, arguably because of the spending on research by the bell system(until divestiture) and by its progeny. precise figures are, unfortunately, difficult to come by.perhaps because telecommunications has not been considered a strategic area for investment,telecommunications research activities do not fall neatly into programs labeled as òtelecommunicationsó nor is telecommunications research funding across the u.s. government trackedas a separate category by nsfõs division of science resources statistics.however, a topdown indication of the level of investment can be obtained from networking and information technology research and development: supplement to the presidentõs budget forfy2006,18 a report of the national coordination office for networking and information technology research and development. it describes the networking and information technologyresearch spending by its 11 participating agenciesñnsf, nih, doe (office of science), nasa,darpa,

these areas. the report divides federal research spending into seven categoriesñhighend computing infrastructure and applications, highend computing r&d, humancomputer interaction and information management, largescale networking (lsn), softwaredesign and productivity, highconfidence software and systems, and social, economic, andworkforce). the total research spending across these agencies and areas for fy 2006 is$2.1 billion, whereas for lsnñthe area likely to contain the most telecommunicationsrelatedresearchñit is $328 million, or 16 percent of the total.the numbers are not definitive: there might, for example, be some physical sciences workthat supports telecommunications, and (similarly uncounted) physical sciences work thatsupports it as well. also, not all of the lsn budget supports networking research per se. forexample, the biggest contributor to support for lsn is nih, at least some of which appears tobe for networks for health sciences research rather than for networking research itself. considering funding for all agencies except for nih funding, the fy 2006 spending on lsn is$230 million out of $1.7 billion, or 14 percent. also, the second largest supporter of lsnresearch is nsf ($95 million); some of nsfõs lsn budget also supports research infrastructurerather than networking research, making the percentage for research itself even lower.national science foundationthere are elements of programs in nsfõs computer and information science and engineering (cise) and engineering (eng) directorates that address aspects of telecommunications research. the cise directorate has, for example, long been an important supporter ofnetworking research (as noted in òthe internet,ó the section above on the development of theearly internet). over the years the eng directorate has made investments in variousareas including wireless and optical communications, and it has established several engineering research centers related to telecommunications. in the view of the committee, however,these efforts as a whole have not represented a major programmatic emphasis by nsfon telecommunications nor reflected a comprehensive, coordinated research strategy intelecommunications.today, as outlined above, telecommunications programs in total see only a modest level offunding. in addition, testimony provided to the committee indicated that overall proposalacceptance rates for most nsf programs related to telecommunications (in the cise and engdirectorates) have been 10 percent or less for the past several years.19in 2004, nsf announced a new $40 million per year program called network technologyand systems (nets), which represents a significant new investment in telecommunicationsresearch and education projects and will focus on the following four areas: programmablewireless networks, networking of sensor systems, networking broadly defined, and futureinternet design.20 the program has latitude for interdisciplinary work that could also involvephysical devices and could suggest a wide range of research topics in the control, deployment,19in his may 2004 testimony to this committee, guru parulkar of nsf indicated that proposal acceptance ratesòin the single digitsó were typical for cise networking research programs.20for more information on nets and its four focus areas, see

management of future networks. however, although the nets program is a welcomesource of additional support and programmatic emphasis on telecommunications research, itsrelatively modest size is likely to have little overall impact on low proposal acceptance rates.in 2005, nsf announced the global environment for networking investigations (geni)initiative, a program still in the planning stage that will focus on new concepts for networkingand distributed system architectures and on experimental facilities to investigate them at largescale. envisioned as encompassing a broad community effort that engages other agencies andcountries, as well as corporate entities, the geni initiative will emphasize the creation of newnetworking and distributed system architectures that, for example:¥build in security and robustness;¥enable the vision of pervasive computing and bridge the gap between the physical andvirtual worlds by including mobile, wireless, and sensor networks;¥enable control and management of other critical infrastructures;¥include ease of operation and usability; and¥enable new classes of societallevel services and applications.21defense advanced research projects agency supportlong a source of support for research on largescale problems, darpa has led in computer networking (via the arpanet and its derivatives) and in the creation of the internet(via its support of tcp/ip protocols and related computer networking services such as email,ftp, gopher, and others) and remains committed today to advances in telecommunicationsfocused research. in the early 1990s, darpa was involved in the research on and adoption ofasynchronous transfer mode (atm) technology, as well as research into packet technologiesfor voice and video. along with nearly 40 other organizations, darpa also completed workon the gigabit testbed initiative, an effort by a host of universities, telecommunication carriers, industry, national laboratories, and computer companies to create a number of veryhighspeed network testbeds and explore their use for scientific research and other applications.22in the late 1990s, darpa also funded the all optical networking consortium, which wasformed by the cooperation of bell laboratories, digital equipment corporation, and the massachusetts institute of technology to examine the unique properties of fiber optics for advanced broadband networking. darpa has also been a longstanding, significant funder ofwireless research.currently, telecommunications research programs in support of battlefield communications continue to be a focus of darpaõs work. examples include the information processingtechnology officeõs (iptoõs) situation aware protocols in edge network technologies(sapient) program,23 and the advanced technology

have changed the face of military systems, computing environments, networking, other military technologies, and ultimately technologies in private industry.25other federally funded telecommunications researchthe previous sections highlight several of the more prominent federal funding programsrelated to telecommunications. but there have been many other important areas of investmentover the years. within dod itself, the service laboratories (office of naval research, air forceoffice of scientific research, and the army research office) as well as other military r&dcenters (such as mit lincoln laboratory, rome air development center, army satellite r&dat ft. monmouth, and so on) have made significant investments in a wide array of telecommunications technologies. another missiondriven investment was made by nasa in support ofsatellite and space missions. finally, programs at the national telecommunications and information administrationõs boulder laboratory have helped advance the field of wireless propagation.historical challenges to doing more telecommunicationsresearch in academiaan indirect consequence of the traditionally high levels of funding for research by the bellsystem and by its progeny has been modest attention to telecommunications in academiacompared to many other areas of information and communications technology. since almostevery aspect of telecommunications was provided by monopoly carriers (both in the unitedstates and abroad), it was difficult to create viable telecommunications courses in academiaand to attract professors who were knowledgeable about the changing telecommunicationsenvironment.more recently, corporate investment in academic work has been quite modest and confined largely to a few successful consortium research programs that have attracted industrysupport and have also, in some cases, been funded by state initiatives. several state programs,notably in california and georgia,26 support academic telecommunications research and interactions with industry.another challenge in teaching telecommunications or carrying out a relevant researchprogram in universities is that the facilities and resources at academic institutions are notadequate to address the architectural and operational issues of largescale telecommunicationsnetworks. since there has never been any pressure or financial incentive to create the resources24likewise, more information about atoõs work can be found online at <http://www.darpa.mil/ato/>.25for a history describing the transition of darpa research into the military, other government organizations,and private industry, see darpa, òtechnology transition,ó [undated], available online at <http://www.darpa.mil/body/pdf/transition.pdf>.26for more information

u.s. telecommunications researchand infrastructure for such research (since these have traditionally and historically been thedomain of the monopoly carriers), most university researchers have opted instead to focus oncore technologies like semiconductors, computing, signal processing, and communicationtheory, where meaningful research can be done at a much smaller scale with fewer resources,and where both industry and government have been more willing to provide the supportneeded to create longrange academic programs.international support for telecommunicationsresearch and developmentin the course of its work the committee developed a keen sense of the increasing competition from international telecommunications industries (in terms of both technology and price).however, it is very difficult to collect comprehensive information on international r&d investment related to telecommunications or to assess how such investments affect a givenindustry. still, there is ample evidence that a number of other nations place considerableemphasis on r&d in this sector. three member countries of the organisation for economiccooperation and development, for example, have legal or regulatory mandates for suchresearch:27¥japanõs ntt law requires ntt to conduct research relating to telecommunications technologies and makes ntt (including the regional companies ntt east and ntt west) responsible for promoting and disseminating the results of telecommunications research.¥koreaõs telecommunications basic law allows the ministry for information and communications (mic) to recommend that service providers contribute a percentage of total annualrevenues to telecommunications research. r&d investments by carriers may be internal orexternal; external contributions are made to an micadministered fund that is then distributedto korean research institutes.¥in 2003, franceõs telecommunications regulations required france telecom to spend4 percent of its unconsolidated revenues on research and development.in addition, several nations and regions conduct major research programs with significantgovernment investment. it is, of course, difficult to compare research programs in detail because of differences in program structure, definitions of telecommunications, and so forth.however, several examples of investments made outside the united states provide a compelling illustration of the high priority being placed on telecommunications r&d outside theunited states. major initiatives include the following:¥the european union sixth framework programme includes nearly $300 million in funding for telecommunications research under the information society technologies program:138 million for mobile and wireless systems and òplatforms beyond 3g,ó 65 million foròbroadband for all,ó 63 million for ònetworked audiovisual systems and home platforms,óand 18 million for research networking testbeds.2827oecd, oecd communications outlook 2005, oecd

almost entirely governmentfunded budget of over $500 million that supports nearly 500 employees, 60 percent of whom are researchers.29 another governmentsupported institution, theresearch institute of telecommunications and economics, carries out economics and policyresearch related to telecommunications.another development is that some u.s. academic telecommunications researchers haveturned to foreign corporations for funding and have, according to information available tomembers of the committee, received funding from companies such as toshiba (japan), huawei(china), and samsung (korea)ñwhich have become formidable competitors of u.s. firms. togain such support, academic institutions have sometimes been asked to surrender ownershipor agree to coownership of intellectual property stemming from the research.finally, beyond research programs, many nations have signaled their commitment to telecommunications as a critical societal and economic element. in particular, china has fostereda strong and growing telecommunications industry. briefers to the committee and reviewersof this report noted the increasing technical sophistication and competitiveness in pricing ofchinese equipment vendors.30 countries such as japan (ejapan), korea (ekorea vision 2006),and taiwan (etaiwan) have launched national programs that aim to broadly promote thedeployment, adoption, and use of information and telecommunications technologies. theyfeature a variety of elements ranging from research funding to policy reforms to incentives forbroadband deployment to national standards and standardsdevelopment processes that (ifonly indirectly) aim to strengthen domestic industries.29see <http://www.nict.go.jp/overview/> or overview pamphlet at

whyresearch and leadership in telecommunications matter.why research mattersthe role of research advances in creating modern telecommunicationsresearch over the past several decades has led to advances ranging from incrementalimprovements to real breakthroughs (socalled disruptive changes1). major advances haveoccurred, for example, in the underlying òphysical layeró communications technologies forwireless, optical fiber, and wireline transmission. these include:¥local area networking technology, notably ethernet and successively faster generations ofethernet standards, which have made it possible to connect many millions of computers bothwithin organizations and to the wider world through the internet;¥radiofrequency communications technologies for cellular systems and wireless local areanetworks, which have enabled modern mobile voice and data communications and havefueled the growth of the entire mobile phone industry;¥optical networks, which have revolutionized communications by providing extraordinary amounts of communications bandwidth over very long distances at very low unit cost,1disruptive technological change often presents significant challenges to incumbents who are using existingtechnologies, but it also leads to dramatically better capabilities for users and to the spawning of entire newindustries.renewing u.s. telecommunications

transformations ofthe public switched telephone network, cable systems, and the internet; and¥broadband local access communication, enabled by technological innovations such as digital subscriber line and cable modems, which has made highspeed internet access widelyavailable to homes and small businesses.disruptive technological change has occurred at the protocol and network levels as well.two notable examples include:¥the internetñthe realization of a revolutionary communications paradigmñwhich introduced a new, highly flexible network architecture and protocols, and ultimately enabledmyriad new applications and services; and¥packetization of voice and video, such as voice over internet protocol (voip), which providesvoice communications with greater flexibility and efficiency and has opened up opportunitiesfor application innovation beyond the boundaries of the public switched network.at the level of applications, the internet in turn has provided a unique laboratory for thecreation of innovative applicationsñemail, instant messaging, collaboration, world wideweb (www) browsers and servers, electronic auctions, and business to business (b2b) andbusiness to consumer (b2c) electronic commerceñthat have changed consumer behavior andbusiness interaction. audio and video have expanded as well, from traditional cable broadcastnetworks to digital cable systems to switched video on the internet, file sharing, and payperview.traditional telephony has also been transformed over time. outofband signaling protocols for the public switched telephone network, such as the current global standard commonchannel signaling system no. 7 (ss7), have made possible the modern worldwide publictelephone network by supporting such features as worldwide direct dialing, wireless roaming, local number portability, and tollfree calling. telephony has also branched out into newapplication areas: voice over packet, wireless telephony, and integrated voice/data applications are industryshaping developments.developments in optical communications provide a good illustration of how multiplethreads of research in electronics, photonics, signal processing, and coding theory have allcontributed to the remarkable growth in optical transport capacity. these developments weredriven first by the advantage of displacing the copper transport plant with optical fiber (early1980s); the emergence of pervasive global connectedness (1980s and 1990s); widespreadinternet use (starting in the mid1990s); and broadband data and video access (starting circa2000). highspeed electronic and optical devices have kept a steady pace with this demand toenable the growth in optical capacity with gigabitspersecond (gbps) silicon and gaas circuits appearing in 1985, leading to todayõs commercial inp circuits working in 40gbps opticalchannels. recent laboratory results have shown that 100gbps electronic circuits are possible.the first reports between 1986 and 1988 of erbiumdoped amplifiers led to wavelengthdivision multiplexing (wdm), which made it practical to carry multiple optical channels on asingle fiber. today more than 100 channels can be carried in a single fiber, with aggregatecapacity exceeding 6 terabits per second. after the introduction of wdm, new optical fibertypes that balance between chromatic dispersion and optical nonlinearities were introduced inthe early 1990s, successfully extending the capacity and range of optical transport systems.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

channels. finally, new codingmethods, in particular forwarderror correction schemes, have greatly increased the designmargins possible for optical transport and have figured significantly in the enhancement ofcapacity and range over the past 5 or 6 years. further technological advances in allopticalsignal regeneration, modulation formats, and channel filtering are expected to continue toenable improvements in fiberoptic communications.the potential for research spinoffsit is also worth reflecting on the many notable spinoffs of past telecommunications research. examples include:¥transistors, which spawned the entire semiconductor and computer industry, and anenormous range of applications in communications, computing, media, and entertainment;¥lasers, which have seen widespread application in medicine (surgery), consumer electronics (cd and dvd players), manufacturing, and even toys and games;¥karmarkarõs algorithm for linear programming, which solved a longstanding problem incomputer science and is an example of the kind of widely applicable solutions to mathematicalproblems that arise in telecommunications;¥unix, created as a result of work aimed at constructing a simple operating system thatfacilitated the construction of widely reusable software tools; the telecommunication industryõsrequirements for high performance helped push forefront research in simple yet powerfulsoftware systems, and today, various flavors of unix are the dominant open standard inoperating systems;¥reduced instruction set computing, the first prototype system for which (the 801 minicomputer at ibm research) had as its application objective a telephone switching system;¥satellite communications and the entertainment industry spawned by telstar, which today are much broader in scope than the pointtopoint communications telstar was built forand were made possible by the initial investment in a single application;¥coding and information theory, developed for data compression and errorcorrection,which has also found application in diverse areas such as cryptography, probability theory,biology, and investment theory.of course, that such spinoffs occurred reflects in no small part the significant investmentin longterm research that was made in the bell system era. these and other spinoffs alsodemonstrate that making major advances in telecommunications requires the solution of technical problems across the spectrum from theory to device physics to software, yielding resultsthat can have broad utility.research for national defense and homeland securityresearch in commercial and defense applications of telecommunications has contributedsignificantly to u.s. military strength. captured in the phrase ònetworkcentric warfare,ó thecentral and growing importance of communications systems to national defense and homeland security makes these key areas that rely on having a strong u.s. research and skill base.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the case for renewed investment in telecommunications research35the intensity of the communications demands that can arise in defense applications isevident in the concept of the future battlefield as being totally dependent on communications:from the fiberoptic cores of military networks to the satellite systems that provide longreachcommunications to the tactical radios carried by soldiers on the battlefield. some of theserequirements are fulfilled via commercial offtheshelf (cots) products. use of cots products is often highly desirable as a means of reducing the cost of infrastructure, yet suchproducts bring concerns as well (see the discussion below in the section òleadership fornational defense and homeland securityó). for example, military requirements can exceedwhat cots products alone can deliver, perhaps because the demands (e.g., the need formultilevel security) are higher or the application environment is different, because of thepresence of an adversary, for instance.in addition to emphasizing the impact of u.s. communications research on c4i (i.e., command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence2), it is also important to brieflynote the relevance to c4i of the engineering disciplines. much of the basic mathematics thatunderlies telecommunications engineering is also relevant to command and control systems.almost any computing device depends heavily on communications technology, both internally to communicate between subelements of the computer and externally to communicatewith other devices. and the field of intelligence is replete with examples of reliance on telecommunications. hence, telecommunications research is significant for and integral to thecapability and capacity of many aspects of the overall defense system.a strong u.s. telecommunications research capability is also important for several indirectreasons related to defense and homeland security:¥skill base of engineering talent: education and training. to solve the specialized communications issues in c4i requires that the united states have the best telecommunications engineersin the world, which in turn requires that a vibrant commercial industry be maintained. otherwise, the best engineers will migrate to countries that have protected or lowcost businesses,and ultimately u.s. security will be put at risk.¥delivery capability of government suppliers. because meeting military requirements depends on fundamental understanding of veryhighspeed optical networks, satellite communications, and support of mobility in the battlefield, it is not sufficient to have a cadre ofeducated and trained individuals. corporate environments must also be available in whichsuch individuals are trained to work together in teams on systemlevel designs, and to take aninterdisciplinary approach.¥interconnectedness of defense systems. as more defense and homeland securityrelatedsystems are interconnected, the pressure will increase on the united states to develop newtechnologies here at home, because relying on foreign suppliers for critical network components like firewalls and communications software might open the door to serious compromises of security and availability across a wide range of defense capabilities.¥military superiority. in a military context, the goal is superiority over the adversary,which requires having the best research and engineering capability in the world.2for more information about c4i, see

future researchtelecommunications continues to be a dynamic sector in which significant innovation ispossible provided proper research investments are made. some examples of potential payoffsfrom telecommunications research include the following:¥a significantly enhanced internet architecture that goes beyond incremental improvements to the existing network architecture to provide enhancements such as greater trustworthiness in the network core and customer networks, improved addressing and routing, andendtoend quality of service provisioning;3¥new network architectures that take advantage of evergreater storage densities, processing speeds, and communications bandwidths;¥more trustworthy telecommunications networks better able to address such challengesas maintaining the security of

computing.the section that follows discusses several broad research areas in more detail.some important areas of emphasis for future telecommunications researchdefining future architectures in an era with more diffuseresponsibility for endtoend issuesmajor innovation in telecommunications has always depended on the industryõs ability tomake major architectural shifts. telecommunications networks are large, complex systems3for a recent overview, see david talbot, òthe internet is broken,ó technology review, 108(11):6269, december2005january 2006, available online at <http://www.technologyreview.com/infotech/wtr16051,258,p1.html>.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the case for renewed investment in telecommunications research37whose reliability, security, and evolvability are dependent on the development of coherentand wellconceived architectural concepts. historical examples within the public telephonenetwork of such major architectural shifts include directdistance dialing, digital transmissionand switching, and the incorporation of cellular telephony into the public telephone network.the internet is another example of a major architectural advance, one made possible by amultiyear research effort funded by the federal government for the first couple of decades(largely on behalf of military and internal research applications).will future advances of this magnitude be more difficult to achieve in todayõs environment, particularly in the united states? the situation now is more dynamic than in the bellsystem days, involving more competition and more opportunities for creative new ideas.today, however, multiple vendorsõ products are used to configure u.s. telecommunicationsinfrastructure and deliver services, and multiple service providers (and thus even more vendors) are involved in delivering services that cross provider boundaries. as a result of theindustryõs shift to a horizontal structure and its fragmentation into a large number of firms,neither vendors nor service providers are prepared to take responsibility for endtoend systems design.no single vendor can now drive architectural change in the same way that at&t was ableto do in the past. telecommunications vendors are able to make incremental improvementswithin existing frameworks, but major advances in system architecture or services may bemore difficult, and innovation in services and applications may become constrained by continued reliance on obsolete network architectures. also, what solutions are developed and deployed may be unnecessarily complex, fragile, and vulnerable because of too little investmentin architectural work.cable televisionõs recent architectural transformation shows how an industry can create anew entity (in this case, cablelabs) to help drive change at least within a particular sector ofthe telecommunications industry. cable systems were transformed from oneway, broadcastonly systems into twoway, multilayer systems that migrated fiber much further into theinfrastructure while retaining coaxial cable as the final link to the customer. this new architecture positioned the cable industry to deliver video, voice, and data services. the nonprofitcablelabs consortium (described in greater detail in chapter 2) was established to addressendtoend issues for the cable industry through activities to identify and develop new technologies, write specifications, certify products, and disseminate information to the cable industry. its activities are supported by subscription and testing fees paid by its members.cablelabs helped foster the introduction of digital transmission and the hybrid fiber coaxial cable architecture found in modern cable systems and developed a series of specifications for cable modems known as the data over cable system interface specification.infrastructure enhancementphysical connectivity is the foundation for telecommunications networks. imagine that theunited states had never deployed copper wires and coaxial cable to connect its homes andbusinesses and now wanted to design the best possible telecommunications infrastructure.there is little doubt about the best design choiceñoptical fiber for high bandwidth complemented by wireless for mobility and flexibility. optical communications would give everyonethe greatest possible amount of bandwidth, would be useful for essentially all applicationsthat have been imagined, and would be future proofñit is known how to continually get morerenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.38renewing u.s. telecommunications researchand more bandwidth out of each fiber. the cost of installing the fiber would be no greater thanthe cost of a new installation of any other medium.today u.s. telecommunications infrastructure has little fiber to the premises, althoughfiber makes up most longhaul and metropolitan area networks. realizing the goal of fibereverywhere involves a number of problems requiring research. for example, while the cost ofoptical components is not a significant problem in core networks because the cost is spreadacross many users, the components represent a nontrivial expense for local access networks,which serve only one user or a handful of users. how can the cost of optical components bereduced sufficiently to make fiber to the home affordable? what architectural approaches offerthe best mix of affordability, performance, and evolvability? what are the future applicationsthat will drive the need for increasing bandwidth?4metropolitan area networks are currently receiving much commercial attention. withtodayõs abundance of fiber in the core, and with access networks creating larger demands, animportant focus of research is to develop architectures that effectively handle evergreatervolumes of optical transmission in metropolitan areas. core networks themselves will requireadvances, and as more capability is introduced into the access networks, the need will grow tocontinue to improve the bandwidthtimesdistance product, as will demands to increase theperformance of national networks.wireless networks provide an even more fertile area for exploration. access to higherbandwidth, which has spurred growing use of the wired internet and is now becoming available to wireless lan users (via wifi and wimax) and fully mobile users (via 3g technology),is basic to the creation of the socalled mobile internet. there are many opportunities forfurther progress. at the physical level fundamental data rate limits for most environments arestill very far from being achieved, and there are practical impediments, such as topographyand the costs of certain components such as filters, to enhanced performance. further development of multiple input, multiple output (mimo) antenna technology, for example, offersopportunities to drive even greater capacity of wireless networks.infrastructure trustworthinessalthough an area of great, growing, and shared concern is the trustworthiness (i.e., security and reliability) of u.s. telecommunications, related research does not seem to be keepingpace with these concerns.5the voice network was designed, engineered, and refined to continue to operate in all butthe most severe disasters and has generally performed well as a result. over the past century,it has evolved from a largely mechanical system into a sophisticated electronic switchingnetwork with a signaling network overlay and a rich set of vertical services provided by4an earlier cstb committee examined many of these and other related issues. see, for example, chapter 4 incomputer science and telecommunications board, national research council, broadband: bringing homethe bits, national academy press, washington, d.c., 2002, available online at <http://fermat.nap.edu/html/broadband/>.5see, for example, computer science and telecommunications board (cstb), national research council (nrc),critical information infrastructure

researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the case for renewed investment in telecommunications research39attached processors and databases. this evolution was clearly necessary to support the ubiquity of interconnections, increases in call volume, and provision of new services. the resultingnetwork has proven generally reliable and secure. but like all networks, it is potentially vulnerable to electronic attack.6data networks, and the internet in particular, evolved in a very different way. the internetbegan as an open collaboration among trusted peers. the protocols were developed to optimize interconnection, simplicity, and accessñcharacteristics that have proven to be some ofthe internetõs greatest strengths, adding to its reliability and scalability. but while redundancyand distribution were contemplated, security and quality of service were not prominent concerns early on. despite the demonstrated advantages of the current architecture, every deviceconnected to the internet can become a source of or a target for malicious activity. and suchmalicious activity has flourished, most publicly in the form of hackers/crackers, viruses,worms, trojan horses, or denialofservice attacks. today both the network and every networked device requires some form of protection, but the protection is neither uniform noruniversal.trustworthiness issues also arise at the intersection of the public telephone network andthe internet. initially, voice and data network interaction was limited to common transportsystems and the use of the voice network to carry data between dialup modems. today,digital subscriber line (dsl) services carry data over the same lines that formerly carried onlyvoice conversations. the volume of data traffic now surpasses the volume for voice traffic, adevelopment that forces consideration of the eventual migration of voice traffic to the datanetwork. in fact, this migration has begunñalbeit more slowly than initially projectedñwithvoice over ip (voip), ip centrex, and softswitch technology. over time voice traffic will increasingly be carried by packet transport and routing. in the interim, interworking betweenthe traditional public switched telephone network and the data networks must be provided.convergence of the voice and data networks, although compelling in features and potentialcost savings, also requires research into the reliability and security of existing voice servicesand the overall converged network.in addition to convergence, new technologies are also enabling new network capabilitiesand services that will in turn pose new challenges to trustworthiness. dense wavelengthdivision multiplexing (dwdm), optical switching, a migration of ethernet into metropolitannetworks, virtual private networking, multiprotocol label switching (mpls), video, unifiedmessaging, and various forms of wireless data all require intelligent network components ordevices. devices and services for personal computing, mobile internet use, and a plethora ofother applications that will leverage these emerging capabilities will also bring more complexity into the core and edges of the networkñand thus new challenges to ensuring security andreliability. public data networks have been built and the number of network providersñincluding30 major internet backbone providers and thousands of internet service providersñhas increased at an unprecedented rate. as a result of all these rapid changes, public networks nowhave many more interfaces to competing networks and therefore many more points of vulner6reflecting the networkõs national importance, additional measures (e.g., planning, coordination, and information sharing via creation of entities such as the national security telecommunications advisory committee andthe national coordinating center for telecommunications) have been taken to help avert attacks and remediatetheir consequences.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.40renewing u.s. telecommunications researchability. the number of new network equipment manufacturers has grown as well. in anenvironment of fierce competition, manufacturers tend to concentrate on improving rawperformance and introducing complex features, sometimes at the expense of building incapability for survivability and security or performing robust testing and quality assurancebefore products enter the network. in addition, todayõs business and regulatory environmentdoes not necessarily provide sufficient incentives for building in redundancy and securitycommensurate with societal needs. clearly, the need to focus research efforts on such criticalissues as the reliability and security of the telecommunications infrastructure is now moreimportant than ever.why leadership mattersleadership is especially important in light of such issues as competing effectively in todayõsglobal marketplace; ensuring u.s. national defense and homeland security; maintaining atelecommunications infrastructure supportive of sustained innovation in telecommunications,which in turn enables innovations in many other industrial sectors; and maintaining the capacity to create new industries.historically, the united states has been able to translate a number of key research advances into leadership positions in telecommunications, as illustrated by the followingexamples:¥cdma technology, which was originally invented and championed by u.s. firms, hasnow been accepted as the worldwide standard for thirdgeneration (3g) mobile networks;¥dsl technology, cable modems, and hybrid fiber coaxial cable technology, all u.s.invented, are used to deliver broadband services throughout the world.¥the internet and its tcp/ip protocols, pioneered in the united states with darpafunding, have come to dominate data networking.the majority of the research and innovation that drove the development of related newbusinesses was done in the united states, positioning u.s. industries to have firstmoveradvantage. not only has the united states been the leader in the core telecommunicationstechnologies and information technology more generally (including processing, storage, communications, and software), but the new businesses and applications built around these technologies are also core areas of u.s. leadership. ownership of intellectual property is also abenefit that often accrues to the country that can lead in innovation, with broad worldwidepatents granted to those companies and universities creating fundamental new advances. thispatent position also benefits these organizations economically.advantage oftenñbut not alwaysñgoes to the home country. on the supply side, it hasbeen beneficial for u.s. trade and commerce that u.s. innovators and firstmovers have beenable to export their products and solutions to other countries. with the united states in thelead for internet innovation, for example, u.s. companies such as cisco and wellfleet communications had a natural market to address, created the initial products, and positioned themselves well for the future. other companies such as rsa and qualcomm developed andpatented key technologies and created strong businesses based on that intellectual property.companies such as aol and yahoo! were naturally positioned to succeed in markets for newservices, and new applications markets were developed by companies like amazon and ebay.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the case for renewed investment in telecommunications research41these examples illustrate notable instances of research breakthroughs having enabled atechnology capability that has, in turn, led to u.s. intellectual leadership in that area. thereare, to be sure, counterexamples. for technologies like television, highdefinition television(more recently), and mobile phone hardware, for example, much of the early work or breakthroughs occurred in the united states, but much of the commercial advantage and manufacturing success has been reaped elsewhere (e.g., japan, china, scandinavia, and so on).although the www was created in europe, the focus quickly shifted to the united states,where a crucial www tool, the graphical browser, was developedñanother example of thepower of strong research leadership and of the importance of the internet research and development ecosystem in the united states, which went on to play a leading role in furtherinnovations such as graphical web browsers, ebusiness, and internet search. the lesson isthat future technology leadership will likely follow the paradigm of advantage to the homeinnovator.the global telecommunications marketmany firms today operate and compete on a global scale, and various forces are at work toincrease the competitiveness of other nations in hightech sectors such as telecommunications.among the many contributing factors are increased investment by other countries in theirown domestic research and training, other forms of government investment in and support fordomestic industries, growing domestic markets, and lower labor costs. in the large economiesof the pacific rim, for example, considerable investment is being made in developing theworkforce. since open standards define much of the telecommunications system, foreign suppliers have an opportunity to bring to market the same products that u.s. competitors offer,but much more cheaply due to lower prevailing wages, less need to invest in basic research,and often a return on their investment guaranteed by home country purchase policies.although almost all telecommunications markets are now global, the degree of opennessand true competitiveness varies. the united states has an open market, with virtually nopressures to buy from local manufacturers. although the u.s. model is most likely to providethe lowest cost and most innovative services to consumers, it does lead to a situation in whichu.s. manufacturers do not have a leg up in their home market and are also substantiallyhandicapped in foreign markets.the typical response to such competitive pressures would be to invest in research thatleads to new products that other manufacturers lack, as a way of reestablishishing preeminence. however, there are several obstacles to following this path in telecommunications.todayõs horizontal industry structure makes many kinds of investment by an individual firmspeculative. in addition, in telecommunications there is a general expectation for compatibilitywith prevailing standards, which makes it difficult for a firm to position itself many yearsahead of its competitors. research advances that lead to major innovative breakthroughs, newarchitectural approaches, and the like are thus especially valuable in responding to globalcompetition.leadership for national defense and homeland securitytwo areas where u.s. interest in ensuring telecommunications leadership is clear arenational defense and homeland security. historically, u.s. technical leadership in commercialrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.42renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcommunications has extended to the military space, and at the same time a host of fundamental telecommunications technologies were developed to meet military needs. examples ofsuch darpafunded telecommunications advances are the internet (from arpanet), opticalnetworking (from monet), and ad hoc wireless networks.in theory, the united states could deploy stateoftheart networks using foreignorigintechnology and supporting research. in practice, however, research, development, and deployment of the most advanced technologies tend to go handinhand.without a continuing focus on telecommunications r&d, the united states will increasingly be forced to purchase technology and services from foreign sources. several risks areevident: (1) u.s. dependence on foreign sources to meet critical defense needs; (2) loss ofexclusive or early access to stateoftheart communications technology; (3) loss of knowhowto employ stateoftheart technology; (4) opportunities for other nations to introduce securityholes into equipment and networks; and (5) loss of technical capability for cyberdefense, suchas cybersecurity, network assurance, and cryptography. network trustworthiness is an especially important subject for public investment, given that it is a public good7 in which individual firms tend to underinvest.in a future conflict, an overseas telecommunications equipment supplier to the u.s. military could become an adversary, making a reliable supply of cots products less likely.another substantial concern with foreign cots products involves vulnerabilities that mightbe designed into highly complex and sensitive communications systems that could be used orcompromised later or in a time of war. the situation is far more complicated when it comes tospecialized devices. clearly, for the u.s. military to have an edge against an adversary requires systems that are better than what is available as cots products.protection of critical infrastructureñwhich includes telecommunications networksñis animportant element of homeland security. today, u.s. telecommunications companies, in addition to providing voice and data communication services to customers via public and privatenetworks, are also responsible for providing a large fraction of the telecommunications infrastructure used by government and the military. the requirement for greater sophistication inthe protection of critical infrastructure is an immense and growing concern. the challengesinclude:¥maintaining the security of todayõs voice network;¥maintaining and improving network robustness in the face of the technical and operational convergence of the voice and data networks, an expanded number of competing network operators, the increasing size and importance of the internet, the burgeoning rise in useof voice over ip applications, and widespread deployment of òalwaysonó broadband accesstechnologies;¥addressing a rising frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyberattacks;¥maintaining greater awareness of possible risks associated with using foreignproducedcommunications infrastructure or cots products (as mentioned above); and¥recognizing that the commercial market is motivated more by the quest for performance and features than by understanding of the need to ensure security and reliability.7this general issue is discussed in more detail in an earlier cstb report. see computer science and telecommunications board, national research council, computers at risk: safe computing in the information age, nationalacademy press, washington, d.c., 1991, p. 17, available online at

research43ensuring a critical mass of talented researchersthe early 21st century is a time of major change with respect to telecommunicationsñaslegacy networks are being phased out and new networks are being phased in, and as pressuresfrom overseas competition mount. now more than ever, research will play a critical role indetermining the future health of the entire u.s. telecommunications ecosystem. in the past,research support has contributed to the production of many talented technical leaders, andone essential component of any strong research system is the cohort of talented researchersinvolved. a healthy level of research support is vital for developing this talent pool and formaintaining and enhancing expertise in telecommunications.talent development in telecommunications generally is heavily supported by researchfunds as graduate students assist seasoned professors in research efforts. inadequate researchfunding at this stage can complicate the ability of universities to attract or develop graduatestudents and their professors. graduates have historically taken positions as postdoctoralresearchers, often at major industrial research laboratories. at this stage, too, there is a needfor research funding.during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, many new, talented ph.d.s left major universities withdetailed knowledge of a specific discipline and began work for industrial research laboratories, where they refined their skills, studied applications of forwardlooking ideas, constructedprototypes, published papers, attended conferences, met the other experts in the area, andgenerally progressed toward being leaders in their field.assessment of the true impact of this model is very difficult to measure, but there is littledoubt that it has been large. for example, many major telecommunications firms have histories that can be traced to individuals who worked at bell laboratories, bellcore, bnr, ibmresearch, xerox parc, motorola, and others. although the committee is unaware of systematically collected data on this point, anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of telecommunications industry leaders developed in this way is quite large.with fewer research opportunities available in industry today, it is more difficult for newgraduates to find opportunities to mature as researchers. the implications of this trend forsustaining a healthy pool of talent and expertise are significant. in todayõs startup companies,former students are almost immediately thrust into product development. the opportunityfor a period of exploration and intellectual growth is thus diminished and, as a result, youngph.d.s may develop less insight into a technological area (while arguably gaining a bettervision of the whole development process and increasing their chances of turning almost anydecent strategy, technological or otherwise, into profitability).several universities have over the years introduced interdisciplinary programs in telecommunications that focus more on telecommunications as an industry rather than just basiccommunications technology (e.g., basic communications courses and research in modulation,coding, protocols, signal processing, and queuing theory) and also address attendant financial, structural, legal, regulatory, and technological issues. those programs usually span suchdisciplines as electrical engineering, computer science, business administration, public policy,and law.8 they generally offer masterõs or other professional degrees rather than doctoral8the international telecommunications education and research association, which seeks to advance telecommunications science through excellence in research and education, has a dozen institutional members located atuniversities and colleges across the united states. see <http://www.itera.org/membership.htm>.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of

noted in other sections of this report, discussion of telecommunications issues mustnow be framed within the current context of global competition among numerous multinational organizationsñand this is certainly the case with respect to producing and retainingtalented researchers. as the developing worldõs educational institutions grow stronger, thereis an increased capacity for leadingedge research and development work abroad. this growing educational capacity combined with improving worldwide telecommunications capabilities and lower wages in developing countries creates pressure for u.s. and other firms to movemore of their research and development and other highskill jobs outside the united states. inaddition, as academic and industry research opportunities in the united states begin to lagthose in other countries, foreign students who are studying in the united states will be morelikely to return to their home countries and participate in the creation of telecommunicationnetworks and services of the future there rather than in the united states.the solution is for the united states to continue to innovate and ensure adequate researchsupport and research opportunities, especially for younger researchers. leadership in research and education is crucial for the maintenance of a technically literate workforce capableof filling all of the positions across the telecommunications ecosystemñincluding reliablesoftware developers, application writers, engineers, systems engineers, researchers, teachers,and so on. if u.s. research remains at the forefront, u.s. students will be exposed to the nextgeneration of technologies earlier than the rest of the world. however, the necessary leadership and an adequate level of talent for telecommunications research can be sustained only ifa healthy u.s. university research system exists. renewed investment and resulting opportunities will make it possible to attract, train, and retain the research talent required for theunited states to maintain a strong position in telecommunications.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

investmentsseveral factors are cited by former bell laboratories researchers as having contributed tothat labõs success with fundamental research. the context for telecommunications research haschanged significantly since that time, but these fundamental lessons nonetheless have application today:¥stable research funding. the concept of no major growth in boom times and no majorcutbacks in bad times for the industry translated to consistent support for fundamental research. the result was a stability of funding and of growth that allowed longterm goals to bepursued.¥research that was limited only by ideas, rather than by resources. this ideal was achieved byenabling highly talented individuals to pursue ideas until either success was achieved or itbecame obvious that the ideas would not work.¥research that was problemdriven. research was managed in the bell system in accordwith a clear and consistent mission informed by constant exposure to real technology (andbusiness) problems and close coupling to the bell operating companies. people working infundamental research were made aware of the most pressing technical problems requiringrevolutionary solutions. such close coupling between research and operations enabled thetransfer of new technology to practice.¥support for interdisciplinary research. at bell laboratories, researchers spanned abroad range of disciplines from physics to economics and thus were able to tackle the crossdisciplinary problems that often arise in designing, deploying, and operating telecommunications systems.it is, of course, extremely unlikely that this full set of conditions can be replicated in anindustry research laboratory today. however, they can be seen as characteristics of the idealrenewing u.s. telecommunications

designand management of both government and industrysupported research programs.the importance of collaboration acrossacademia and industryresearchers outside industry can be disadvantaged for some types of research by a lack ofspecifically necessary information or access to facilities that are crucial to a quality and relevant outcome. an example is a researcher leveraging network traffic statistics to define asuperior protocol (what are realistic traffic models?), or a researcher defining superior mechanisms to manage network recovery from disaster (what are realistic assumptions about thescope of damage to the network?). in fact, as research becomes more immediately relevant itinevitably becomes more dependent on òinsideó information and facilities. it is thus essentialthat industry seek to inform the research sponsors and performers as to their more criticallongterm issues and opportunities that are amenable to research. concerns about intellectualproperty in such collaboration can be addressed by having faculty researchers sign nondisclosure agreements that let them work with and understand the industrial context in depthbut that also protect a companyõs intellectual property unless permission is granted by thecompany.1researchers themselves are also motivated to make an impact, and in most cases welcomeand appreciate visibility into what the ultimate customers of the researchñboth industry andend usersñsee as their greatest need. armed with that understanding, they can pursue theirown ideas, some with more nearterm and direct application and others more radical andspeculative. this is not to imply that industry should define and direct both the researchprojects and the approaches that are pursued. nor does it imply that all telecommunicationsrelated research should tackle issues defined by industry. researchers are more enthusiasticand ultimately more effective if they pursue their own ideas, and industry itself often fails toencourage or even recognize radical new innovations.the importance of visionpast u.s. leadership in telecommunications has benefited from the creation and pursuit ofa welldefined vision for managing investments. however, in todayõs telecommunicationsenvironment, which includes a broad array of service providers and equipment vendors, sucha clearly defined and broad vision is much more difficult to achieve.in the predivestiture bell system, the development of a vision and associated roadmappingactivities for the telephone system were carried out largely by at&t (together with a smallnumber of overseas telephone companies that were also vertically integrated monopoly providers). at&t and its peers were successful in developing and realizing a series of major newvisionsñsuch as direct longdistance dialing, electronic switching, digital transmission andswitching, and outofband signaling and intelligent network services (which separated service logic from switching equipment).1there are also other ideas emerging regarding new means for collaboration; see, for example, raymond e.miles, grant miles, and charles c. snow, collaborative entrepreneurship: how communities of networked firms usecontinuous innovation to create economic wealth, stanford university press, stanford, calif., 2005.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.mechanisms and best practices for renewing telecommunications research47significant visionsetting and associated design work have also been carried out in particular sectors of the telecommunications industry. the cable industry developed a new architectureñhybrid fiber coaxial cableñthat allowed delivery of digital, twoway services over itsnetworks. the wireless industry is now well into the deployment of a third generation ofcellular services (which exist in several different flavors), each of which has supported greatercapacity in terms of users and bandwidth per user, and has involved broad thinking aboutdesired capabilities and the technological advances required to achieve them. such efforts aregenerally considered to have been successful within the confines of individual industry sectors, but they have not addressed major architectural issues across these sectors.although individual segments of the industry have successfully pursued the rollout ofnew services, such as secondgeneration cellular or hybrid fiber coaxial cable television, theunited states today does not have processes or forums for defining or implementing broader(crosssector) visions or for establishing how much and what types of research are needed.the situation stands in contrast to that in some other regions of the world where institutions and processes are in place to define and implement telecommunications visions (see thesection òinternational support for telecommunications research and developmentó in chapter 2). there are, to be sure, strong arguments on both sides of the debate over the benefits ofplanned and structured technological programs versus unstructured ones in which manyindividual firms can attempt to develop their ideas. nonetheless, it is worth exploring furtherthe role that visionsetting activities could play in fostering future telecommunicationsadvances.vision for the 21st centurya major shift occurred in telecommunications toward the end of the 20th century. agrowing realization emerged that the pstn was not an efficient and costeffective way ofmoving large amounts of data over a network. the basic insight was that packetbased networks could statistically multiplex data (including realtime voice and video) over a besteffort data network and still achieve high performance, universal connectivity, and reliabledata transport. the internet, which is really just an interconnection of hundreds of thousandsof such packet networks, has proved this idea on a wide scale and has become the model fortelecommunications in the 21st century. this breakthrough arose in an environment in whichdarpa leadership, vision setting, and funding allowed research, development, and earlydeployment and operation to be performed by a diverse yet small and tightly knit communityin an environment relatively free of commercial concerns.the promise of the internet is the ability to bring unlimited bandwidth and computationalpower to every home, office, and even to individuals who are highly mobile, thereby enablingpeople to remain in constant contact with other people and with information of virtually anyform. hence one formulation of a bigvision problem for the 21st century would be somethinglike òuniversal broadband connectivityñanywhere, anytime.ó but who will espouse this(or an appropriate alternative) vision, who will champion it through the regulatory and standardization bodies, who will invest in the necessary array of technologies, and who will workthrough the details associated with designing, implementing, and deploying products andservices? in contrast to some other regions of the world (most notably korea and japan in asiaand various european nations), neither u.s. industry nor the u.s. government has a clearlydefined, forwardlooking vision for telecommunications, and more importantly, no process inrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.48renewing u.s. telecommunications researchplace to define and implement such a vision. the consequence of this lack of vision is that thenecessary complementary investments that should be made by the semiconductor houses, theequipment vendors, and the service providersñall in support of a vision held in commonñmay not be made because of the risk of investing in areas that are not supported across thetelecommunications industry.the most successful visions will originate not only from new technological capabilities, butalso from commercial and societal need. execution of a vision requires not only the design andimplementation of technology but also coordinated activities by regulators and governmentand industries such as those that finance the ventures. thus it is important that not onlyindustry, but also the brightest minds in academia and government and regulatory agenciesbe active participants. also, although a u.s. vision would focus on the future of u.s. telecommunications applications and supporting infrastructure and services, the global range of bothnetworks and technology supply chains means that coordination with global visionsettingefforts is essential.without a clear vision in place, the risk is that the u.s. telecommunications industry willtake a òwait and seeó approach and make as few risky investments as possible until a de factovision is defined externally, either in the global telecommunications community by the fewcountries that take leadership roles, or by the international standards bodies (which in theabsence of other leadership provide the de facto roadmaps for the introduction of new technology). either path could have negative longterm effects on the u.s. economy if leadershipin telecommunications moves to asia and europe and the united states has to play the role ofa fast followerña role to which we are generally unaccustomed.roadmapsthe path through which new technologies are introduced varies considerably across different industries. sometimes, an innovation can be made based on a small, local, granularinvestment. but more often, an advance requires complementary work to be done in a varietyof areas by a variety of actors.in the semiconductor industry, for example, the effort to bring everfaster processors tomarket requires an entire industry to move together. fabricators must make enormous investments in new manufacturing facilities, tooling companies must move to a next generation offabrication processes, and microprocessor manufacturers must be convinced that a more powerful system will sufficiently expand the market to justify the investment.roadmapping is a process to address these complementarities. the semiconductor industry, for example, is guided by two fundamental elements. first, there is the semiconductorindustryõs international technology roadmap for semiconductors (itrs),2 a mechanism thatallows all players to move to the next generation of technologies and practices smoothly andsimultaneously.3 the itrs identifies the short and longterm technological challenges andneeds facing the semiconductor industry. it is sponsored by the u.s.based semiconductor2see <http://public.itrs.net/>.3for another overview of the semiconductor roadmap, see bill spencer, linda wilson, and robert doering, òthesemiconductor technology roadmap,ó

reserved.mechanisms and best practices for renewing telecommunications research49industry association (sia), the european semiconductor industry association, the japan electronics and information technology industries association, the korean semiconductor industry association, and the taiwan semiconductor industry association. in addition, sematech(described in more detail below) acts as the global communication center for the itrs, and theitrs team at sematech coordinates events in the u.s. region. second, the industry benefitsfrom the insight provided by more than 20 yearsõ experience with the successful introductionof new technologies and productsñinsight that assures manufacturers that each expansion incapability will result in an expansion of market.an industry roadmap is, in essence, a strategic plan for an entire industry, undertaken asa precompetitive industry collaborative activity, that informs the need for specific researchdirections, identifies necessary complementary investments across the horizontal industrythat spans semiconductors to applications and content, and identifies related policy issues. itrecognizes that the industry is characterized not only by competition of like companies (likeservice providers in the same geographical region), but also by noncompetitive complements(like semiconductor manufacturing equipment and fabrication facilities, or telecommunications transmission facilities and the applications making use of them) where some level ofprecompetitive coordination can greatly reduce investment risks for all participants withoutinterfering with competition or negating its benefits. a good roadmap is not overly prescriptive, however, and only does what is necessary to ensure success of the industry as a wholeand no more, and leaving as much as possible to market choice.roadmaps are already used in segments of the telecommunications industry. for example,the optoelectronics industry development association produces a roadmap covering opticalcomponents and, to some extent, optical communication systems. also, various segments ofthe industry and individual firms have carried out efforts to define and develop new architectures, including the cable industry (which has deployed hybrid fiber coaxial cable and whichis pursuing voice over ip) and both the cable and telephone companies (which are pursuing avariety of strategies for deploying fiber to the home and the òtriple playó of video, internet,and phone services).broader roadmapping activities for telecommunications would be somewhat differentfrom those for the semiconductor industryñthe issues are more complex and involve moreinterdependencies. there are a large number of potential actors. delivering a new set ofservices on a new telecommunications infrastructure may require the cooperation of manycomponent providers, system vendors, application developers, and service providers. theservice providers themselvesñincluding incumbent local exchange carriers, competitive localexchange carriers, cable multiple system operators, cellular carriers, and wireless service providersñcover a wide range of interests, regulatory status, and geographical coverage. moreover, with telecommunications spanning all layers from physical infrastructure to applications and content, investment decisions may involve content providers in addition to serviceproviders. however, the basic idea is still relevant that processes and forums get peoplethinking about the longer term, and in a more coordinated way.roadmapping should not be mistaken for a definitive path that a technology or industrymust follow. a roadmap certainly does identify certain technologies and applications that areimportant or even necessary for growth of an industry as a whole, and it identifies the complementary investments (and staging of those investments) necessary for industry progress. however, a roadmap often incorporates alternative scenarios that might ultimately be successful,and does not try to pick which might finally be accepted. roadmaps often explicitly attempt torenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.50renewing u.s. telecommunications researchleave as much freedom as possible for individual companies to differentiate themselves at thecompetitive stageñonly doing what is necessary to ensure success of the industry as a wholeand no more, and leaving as much as possible to the discretion of market choices.roadmapping requires broad participation and sustained, significant investment. undertaking an industrywide roadmap is likely to be a costly and timeconsuming task if it is donewell and has broad support and participation. roadmaps are also living documents that mustbe updated as circumstances change.the environment for telecommunications investment is also shaped by legislative andregulatory decisions. the overall framework for the telecommunications industry as a partlyregulated industry has long been the subject of specific legislation. implementation of thislegislation is carried out through ongoing regulatory proceedings. both factors contribute tothe uncertainty surrounding new, longterm infrastructure investments.another piece of the roadmapping puzzle is the set of standards organizations. equipmentvendors move directly from the standards organization to implement the ideas into products,often even concurrently with the standards negotiations. here u.s. companies have beenleaders recently in setting the standards in some organizations such as the internet engineering task force. standards are also developed through organizations such as the institute ofelectrical and electronics engineers and the international telecommunication union. todaythere are new standards organizations (e.g., chinese efforts to establish unique versions ofcdma; 4g standards coming out of japan) in which the united states has not been playing asstrong a role.a more vertical structure to the telecommunications industry, greater government involvement, or a history of collaboration have made roadmapping a more central part oftelecommunications programs outside the united states, accompanying the broader involvement of governments in directing technical developments and infrastructure deployment.policies in korea have long emphasized the deployment of broadband infrastructure. in theeuropean union, collaboration that begins at the research level through the framework programs establishes an early set of partnerships among countries, service providers, manufacturers, and other participants in the value chain. in europe, these efforts have extended muchfurtherñto later standardization of the actual new architectures, as was the case with the gsmwireless system.in contrast, the united states tends to rely heavily on market forces and has a philosophythat lack of central control spurs innovationñand these arguments certainly carry considerable weight. yet, it may well be possible to make use of roadmapping without unduly inhibiting innovation, nor does roadmapping necessarily imply the heavy hand of government.certainly the semiconductor industry is widely viewed as having benefited from followingthat path.roadmapping and researchthere are several ways in which roadmaps can help focus and enhance the impacts ofresearch.first, roadmaps can add predictability to infrastructure deployments. an invention in onepart of a value chain has impact only if an industry consensus across many different types ofcompanies motivates each to do its share. the absence of any roadmap makes this consequence doubtful. the result: no motivation to invest in research.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.mechanisms and best practices for renewing telecommunications research51second, roadmaps can enhance the impact of short to mediumterm research. a component maker might create a much better device, but unless the vendor incorporates the newdevice in its products, the service provider uses it to improve service, and the customer likesthe feature, there is no guarantee that it will be used.third, roadmaps can help enable disruptive systemlevel research. disruptive change intechnology often requires upsetting the role that each company plays in a value chain. tosuccessfully develop such architectures requires an interdisciplinary approach, namely diverse participants that bring different perspectives to the table. to get systemlevel insightsfrequently requires crosscompany cooperation, which is difficult.an interesting example is the darpafunded monet program of the mid1990s. in thiscrosscompany and university consortium, the teams used the opportunity to invent much ofthe advanced optical technology that had an impact on the industry in the late 1990s. here theu.s. government played an important convening role, aside from providing the funding.although opinions vary as to the ultimate effectiveness of the program, the europeanunion sixth framework programme for telecommunications research provides an example ofhow research and roadmapping interrelate. the structure of the research projects anticipatesthe ultimate creation of an infrastructure. each program involves a variety of players, including component manufacturers, system vendors, software firms, universities, and service providers. as a result, companies can better evaluate the impact of their technology, and severalplayers in the industry can plan new beneficial roadmaps together.advantages and disadvantages of telecommunications roadmappingto summarize, roadmapping processes could help the telecommunications industry address several critical issues:¥ensuring complementary progress in the underlying core technologies. such a roadmap, whichwould address physicallayer communications, computing, and storage technologies, has striking similarities to the semiconductor industryõs roadmap.¥enhancing intermodal and endtoend interoperability. issues include architecture and functional interoperability across vendors, equipment types, and geographic regions.¥identifying and exploring complementary elements required for realizing a vision. for example,interactive broadband multimedia applications depend on complementary investments bydistinct industry segments including applications (software industry), compelling content (thevideo game, music, and movie industries), the network and access to broadband connectivity(the telecommunications service provider industry), and customer premises equipment (computer and consumer electronics industry).¥identifying knowledge gaps. obvious gaps include technology or manufacturing processes.other knowledge gaps include economic viability (e.g., building ubiquitous broadband accessfacilities) and the viability of the market opportunity (e.g., how much customers would bewilling to pay).¥identifying complementary policy, legal, and regulatory considerations. roadmapping canalso be used to identify needed changes in the legal or policy framework (e.g., telecommunications policy or intellectual property rights) and needed regulatory initiatives and their viability (e.g., policies relating to spectrum use or broadband deployment).renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.52renewing u.s. telecommunications researchon the other hand, roadmapping is not a panacea and brings with it a number of tradeoffsand possible limitations. for example, the roadmapping process could hinder the adoption ofnew, disruptive technologies (e.g., incumbents may be unwilling to try radical innovations). italso should be recognized that there is quite a leap from agreement on an element of a roadmapto a commitment to purchase a product.mechanisms for industry, government, and universitycollaboration on r&d fundinga variety of interesting models for mobilizing research and development support havedeveloped to answer particular r&d needs. cablelabs, described in chapter 2, provides anexample of a telecommunications sector organizing itself to address the focused needs of aparticular set of stakeholders.experiences from the electric power and semiconductor industries provide additionalexamples of how industry or industry in combination with the federal government can cometogether to address critical research needs:¥electric power research institute. in 1971, u.s. public and private utilities created anorganization to conduct electricityrelated r&d. under pressure from congress (which hadsignaled in hearings that it might call on a federal agency to play this role), the electric powerresearch institute (epri) began work in 1973 as a private, nonprofit organization to provideclear, credible scientific and technical research. today, epriõs members represent over90 percent of the u.s. electricity research community, and the organization maintains a memberdriven annual budget of around $272 million. the majority of epriõs members are investor owned, but the organizationõs membership also includes international organizations, andit classifies roughly 7 percent of its members as òfederal/stateó (e.g., the tennessee valleyauthority, california energy commission, and so on).¥semiconductor research corporation. the semiconductor research corporation (src) wascreated in 1981 with the help of the semiconductor industry association (sia) to stimulatecooperative research into semiconductor technology by industry and u.s. universities. srcwas funded by member companies through fees based on their semiconductor sales and otherfactors. early 1982 saw the newly incorporated src lining up a number of industry anduniversity partners, and by 1983 src could count as members nearly 30 universities and suchindustry heavyweights as, among others, amd, dec, honeywell, intel, ibm, motorola, ge,harris corp., and hp. srcõs 1983 budget was approximately $11 millionñprimarily industryfundingñand since it was established src has funded more than $500 million in longtermsemiconductor research. src has also established partner relationships with other institutionssuch as nsf and sematech.¥sematech. in 1987, 14 u.s. semiconductor companies joined forces to create a nonprofit research and development organization called sematech to improve domestic semiconductor manufacturing. a year later, congressñworried about the increasing u.s. dependence on foreign suppliers for semiconductor technologyñappropriated $100 million per yearfor 5 years to match sematechõs industrial funding. the federal funding for sematechwas channeled through darpa because semiconductor manufacturing was seen as vital tothe nationõs defense technology base. darpa continued its investment in sematech beyond the original deadline, but in 1995 sematech announced that it would wean itself fromrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.mechanisms and best practices for renewing telecommunications research53public assistance and seek an end to matching federal funding after 1996 as a result of therenewed health of the u.s. industry. a critical element of sematechõs program over theyears has been the development and refinement of a technology roadmap for the semiconductor industry. reflecting the value of its work, sematech has since grown and expanded toinclude significant international participation.4the national science foundation has also established programs for collaborative engineering research among academia and industry. chief among these is the engineering research centers program5 that was established in 1985 to support crossdisciplinary, systemsoriented research between academia and industry, education and outreach, and technologytransfer. the engineering research centers (ercs) have supported research on a range ofsubjects from bioengineering to earthquake engineering to microelectronic systems and information technology. fiscal year 2004 total annual funding from all sources provided directly toeach erc ranged from $3.1 million to $11.3 million, with nsfõs contribution ranging from$2.5 million to $4.0 million per year.6nsf also administers the industry university cooperative research centers program,7which aims to use limited nsf investments to stimulate industryacademic research partnerships with the bulk of the support coming from industry center members. focus areas forcenters in this program include advanced electronics, advanced manufacturing, civil infrastructure systems, information and communications, and system design and simulation,among others. in the past, some work coming out of this program has been very telecommunications specific. for example, in 1997 a professor at a communicationsrelated center foundeda company to design a new switch capable of applying his algorithms for maximizing qualityof service. after 3 years of work, this company was acquired for nearly half a billion dollars.8establishing an advanced telecommunicationsresearch activitythe committee believes that a hybrid approach is best suited to the challenges facing thetelecommunications industry. such a hybrid, dubbed the advanced telecommunicationsresearch activity (atra) in this report, would (1) draw in part on the strengths of thedarpa model in enabling creative, often risktaking research under the direction of a lean,agile, and independent cadre of program managers that would include researchers from bothindustry and academia; (2) draw on the strengths of the industrydriven models representedby sematech, src, and epri to ensure significant industry participation and buyin; and(3) reflect the collaborative, multidisciplinary research model in the nsf engineering research centers program. most research would be performed externally at universities andother research institutions; inhouse research might be appropriate in specific areas.4a more detailed history of sematech is available in computer science

reserved.54renewing u.s. telecommunications researchindustry funding would represent a significant fraction of total funding, and industryresearchers would be deeply involved in research activities. further, to ensure that atra isresponsive to industry needs, one or more advisory committees would be established withrepresentatives from equipment suppliers and service providers. additional advisory committees might be established to address individual major technology areas (e.g., optical andwireless communications or network security) or the interplay between technology and regulatory developments.the new research organizationõs multifaceted mission would include the following:¥identifying, coordinating, and funding telecommunications research for the nation. the focuswould be critical telecommunications research in which the nation is currently underinvesting,including (1) longtimehorizon speculative research that seeks to explore transformative newideas; (2) precompetitive research that seeks to turn both incremental and transformativeideas into practice, suitable for others to exploit commercially; (3) longterm and precompetitive research on network trustworthiness, when commercial incentives are insufficient tomotivate research to make the nationõs critical infrastructure more robust; and (4) interdisciplinary research at the intersection of technology, economics, and policy, including work thatstudies the technical, economic, and sociological issues underlying regulatory decisions.¥fostering the conception, development, and implementation of major architectural advances.major advances in telecommunications capabilityñsuch as direct longdistance dialing, hybrid fiber coaxial cable systems, or the internetñhave all required the conception, development, and deployment of novel network architectures. similar advances in the future dependon carrying out sustained research and development activities.¥strengthening the nationõs telecommunications research capacity by building up researchgroups, centers, and other institutions with sufficient scale and breadth of expertise to tacklerealworld problems and by strengthening connections between the industrial and academiccommunities and among the telecommunications, semiconductor, and computer segments ofthe it industry. to provide major experimental facilities useful to but beyond the capabilitiesof individual university research groups or firms, an infrastructure for fabrication, prototyping,and testing would be supported as needed. to facilitate research and development on largescale problems, such as endtoend interoperability testing or network security and reliability,major facilities for experimentation would be supported as needed.options for locating the new telecommunications research activityin the federal governmentatra could be established simply by supplementing the mission of nsf or darpa, butit might be preferable to create it as a standalone activity. nsf is largely focused on enablingfundamental breakthroughs and stimulating a wide diversity of activities rather than addressing problems with an explicitly industry focus, although its engineering research centersprogram is a possible model. darpa today focuses more on military applications and appears unlikely to sponsor a major activity aimed at challenges and opportunities of a predominantly commercial nature.another possible home for such an activity is the department of commerce, which alreadyconducts research and standards activities through the national institute of standards andtechnology (nist) and which supports some telecommunications research through the narenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.mechanisms and best practices for renewing telecommunications research55tional telecommunications and information administrationõs (ntiaõs) research and engineering branch, the institute for telecommunications sciences, which is noted, for example,for its work on radio propagation. nist has a long track record of working with industry onproblems of interest to industry and a long tradition of research on it and telecommunicationsproblems. ntiaõs mission centers around telecommunications, and it has a research program,albeit much smaller and narrower than the activities recommended here.toward increased industry support fortelecommunications researchresearch that seeks fundamental breakthroughs in communications services and applications or seeks to define new service architectures and transition strategies may not necessarilybenefit any one company exclusively, but companies that have made more strategic or rapidresearch investments stand to benefit as new capabilities are developed and deployed in theindustry. the committee believes that the u.s. telecommunications industry should certainlyincrease its support for more fundamental, cooperative, breakthrough researchñalthough thecommittee also understands that the issues involved in doing so are complex. for example, aprimary obstacle to overcome is òfreeridingó (a concept described in more detail in chapter2), whereby any one company can benefit from the freely available results of research evenwhile failing to contribute to it. a solution might be the use of mechanisms for sharing resources and responsibility for research across the industry, as an alternative to conductingproprietary research within each carrier. another way to encourage service provider participation is for government to provide matching funds or other incentives such as r&d taxcredits.one avenue for increasing industry support for fundamental research would be participation in joint, cooperative research activities organized by atra and funded jointly by industry and government whereby industry could pool funds, spread risk, and share beneficialresults through cooperative efforts between industry and academia. another option is cooperative resource sharing. an example is a sharedresponsibility research program conductednot long ago by the regional bell operating companies through bellcore, which they ownedjointly. however, as the companies began to compete with one another, they divested bellcore.in contrast, the proposed atra would not be subject to the same pressures because it wouldbe led by the federal government rather than a board made up of competing firms.an organization such as bellcore can provide a forum for research and development workthat spans multiple service providers and addresses issues offering little potential for companies to distinguish themselves individually and thus little incentive to invest; for certainactivities, significant savings from centralization and economies of scale and scope; and opportunities for conducting endtoend interoperability testing across equipment manufactured by different vendors that otherwise would entail an investment in equipment too expensive for individual research groups.examples from other industries of creative cooperation show that, provided care is takenin the type of research conducted (e.g., keeping the time horizons long and focusing on majorarchitectural advances), the outcomes can be mutually beneficial to the industry as a wholewhile not harming the chance to compete vigorously in current or nearerterm business opportunities. examples of simultaneous cooperation and competition (òcoopetitionó) can be foundrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright

infrastructure for operation of the u.s. economy and society. manyu.s. companiesñindeed whole new industriesñhave benefited from and even developed as aresult of u.s. strength in telecommunications. notably, the modern internet and internetbased businesses ranging from cisco to yahoo! would not have been possible without pasttelecommunications research leading to such advances as highspeed optical communicationsand packetswitched networks.today, however, the position of the united states as a leading producer of telecommunications technology, basic knowledge, and necessary human talent (a critical componentñasdescribed in chapter 3) is at risk. the risk is magnified by the long period of timeñas much asa decade or even longerñthat it can take to translate a fundamental discovery or big new ideainto a commercial product or service or to educate and train a new researcher.the committeeõs findings below outline challenges to the telecommunications sectorõscontinuing capacity for innovation. the recommendations that follow identify actions that theu.s. telecommunications industry, research community, and government should take togetherto strengthen the nationõs telecommunications research institutions and programs.findingsfinding 1. the scope of telecommunications technology and of the industry itself has growndramatically over the past few decades, driven primarily by the success of the internet andits applications, by the digitization of all types of media and forms of communication, andby the rising importance of communications as a key enabling technology.the telecommunications industry, which once consisted mainly of the telephone companies and their equipment vendors, has expanded greatly. it now includes a broad set of serviceproviders, including telephone companies, cable operators, internet service providers, andrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.58renewing u.s. telecommunications researchwireless carriers, as well as equipment vendors offering fiberoptic, cable, and wireless connections. telecommunications comprises all the hardware and software for the telecommunications infrastructure and the applications that run over that infrastructure. it involves communication of information in a wide array of media including voice, images, animation, video,documents, and data.finding 2. without a renewed and sustained investment in telecommunications research,the united states risks losing global leadership in telecommunications and related industries, with significant consequences for the u.s. economy and society.should the united states be concerned if leadership in telecommunications moves offshore, as has occurred for many other entire industries? the recent fast pace of innovation, thearray of new ideas to be pursued, and the substantial investment in telecommunications byother nations are all indications that telecommunications remains a highvalue sector in whichrapid innovation and fundamental change will continue well into the future. far from amature industry, telecommunications is thus one in which the united states should strive forcontinuing leadership. the importance of maintaining u.s. leadership is underscored by telecommunicationsõ critical contribution to u.s. leadership in information technology in general,its important contribution to improving productivity in nearly all industries, and its role innational security and homeland defense.finding 2.1. the united states faces strong and growing competitive pressures from nations that aremaking significant investments in telecommunications r&d.nations such as china, japan, korea, and member states of the european union haveidentified telecommunications as a strategic area for economic development and have launcheda variety of initiatives to enhance academic, industry, and joint industryacademic research inaccord with vigorously promulgated national visions. equipment vendors in a number ofcountries (such as china) now compete strongly with u.s. firms and have been very successfulin emerging markets. some nationsõ active support for their domestic industries has extendedbeyond investment in research to include measures for protection of domestic telecommunications industries, thus placing further stress on the u.s. telecommunications industry.finding 2.2. the health of the u.s. telecommunications sector depends on maintaining leadership ininnovation.telecommunications products and services generally become commoditized over time asmultiple firms acquire the knowhow to supply similar, competing products, and such competition has benefits in terms of lower prices for goods and services. to maintain leadershipñoreven a strong positionñin telecommunications in the face of pressures from lower costs overseas for labor and other essentials thus requires that u.s. firms constantly focus on achievinghighvalue innovation as a foundation for developing noncommodity products and services.research leadership in telecommunications by u.s. academic research institutions and government and industry labs has historically given the nation an advantage in terms of access tonew technologies and the highestcaliber engineering talent.notable benefits have accrued to the united states as a result of its leadership in definingthe internetõs design, for example. howeverñby virtue of its very successñthe existinginternet architecture has become difficult to change. despite many potential avenues for significant improvements in areas ranging from security to realtime audio and video transmisrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.findings and recommendations59sion, research and development has become largely incremental in nature. moreover, thecurrent architecture is largely commoditized, and firms from other nations will become increasingly able to deliver competitive products and services. research aimed at defining future architectures promises particular benefits because u.s. firms will be positioned to offernew kinds of services and not just incremental improvements to existing ones.finding 2.3. without renewed investment and resulting opportunities to do research, it will be verydifficult to attract, train, and retain the research talent required for the united states to maintain astrong position in telecommunications.sustaining a base of researchers and research institutions is critical to the longterm healthof a research discipline. without adequate research funding, it will be hard to attract newstudents to the field, retain foreign students in the united states, provide critically neededsupport for postdoctoral researchers, or attract and develop new faculty and industrial researchers.finding 2.4. u.s. critical infrastructure, national defense, and homeland security, which depend onhaving uninterrupted access to leadingedge telecommunications technology, are potentially threatenedby the loss of a domestic telecommunications industry.without a continuing focus on telecommunications r&d, the united states will increasingly be forced to purchase telecommunications technology and services from foreign sources.risks include (1) u.s. dependence on foreign sources of technology to meet critical defenseneeds; (2) loss of exclusive or early access to stateoftheart communications technology;(3) loss of knowhow to employ stateoftheart technology; (4) opportunities for other nationsto introduce security holes into equipment and networks; and (5) loss of technical capabilityfor cyberdefense in such areas as cybersecurity, network assurance, and cryptography.finding 3. investment in telecommunications research yields major direct and indirectbenefits.finding 3.1. u.s. telecommunications research has yielded tremendous direct and indirect returns.notable payoffs from u.s. investment in telecommunications research and related areas inrecent decades include the following:¥the internet, which realized a new communications paradigm, introduced a new, highlyflexible network architecture and protocols, and ultimately enabled myriad new applicationsand services;¥radiofrequency communications technologies for cellular systems and wireless local areanetworks, which have enabled modern mobile voice and data communications;¥optical networks, which have revolutionized communications by providing extraordinary communications bandwidths at very low unit cost; and¥voice over ip (voip), which provides voice communications with enhanced flexibilityand efficiency and has provided opportunities for innovation in applications beyond thoseprovided by the public switched network.additional examples are provided in chapter 3.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.60renewing u.s. telecommunications researchfinding 3.2. there are many promising avenues for telecommunications research, and renewed u.s.investment would yield major dividends, as indicated by the following possible results:¥an enhanced internet architecture that goes beyond incremental improvements to deliver capabilities such as greater trustworthiness in the network core and in customer networks, improved addressing and routing, and endtoend qualityofservice provisioning;1¥more trustworthy networks that can better cope with the rising frequency, sophistication, and severity of attacks and the complexities and interdependencies associated with theconvergence of voice and data networks;¥telepresence and telecollaboration environments that reproduce at a distance a localspace with the fidelity needed to allow people to work in concert;¥public safety networks that offer greater mobility, interoperability, adaptability to harshand changing conditions, and increased resiliency to damage; and¥adaptive and cognitive wireless networks that enable higherperformance communications and more efficient use of radio spectrum, allowing them to provide capabilities that rivaland complement those associated with wired networks.additional examples are provided in chapter 3. as in the past, the biggest payoffs may wellcome from unanticipated breakthroughs achieved in the course of pursuing such challengingproblems.finding 3.3. telecommunications research carried out on behalf of the telecommunications industry canhave a powerful payoff for all members of the industry.because the value of a network grows with the number of its users, network operators willseek to make their networks interoperable with those of other operators. interoperation requires some degree of common technology, which means that many network innovationscannot be appropriated by a single player.finding 4. over the past two decades, u.s. telecommunications research has been adverselyaffected by the level of research investment and the decreasing time horizon of research.the erosion of telecommunications research in industry mirrors, to a certain extent, broadcutbacks in u.s. industry r&d in general. the impact has been significant, underscoring thehistorical importance of industry research and mirroring the rapidity of the telecommunications sectorõs restructuring following divestiture in 1984. the problems were obscured duringthe time of the internet bubble, which saw a surge of telecommunicationsrelated investment,but became quite apparent when the bubbleõs bursting led to a dramatic decrease in telecommunications research investments in 2001 and beyond.finding 4.1. historically, the bell system played a leading role in longterm, fundamental telecommunications research in the united states.the bell system maintained a large research program and talent pool and ensured a flowof ideas and innovation across disciplines and among the research, business, and operationaldivisions of at&t. it supported an infrastructure that nurtured successive advances in the1for a recent overview, see david talbot, òthe internet is broken,ó technology review, 108(11):6269, december2005january 2006, available online at <http://www.technologyreview.com/infotech/wtr16051,258,p1.html>.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.findings and recommendations61development chain from device fabrication to systems design to implementation and operation. it also provided a nucleus for the telecommunications research community. because ofthe bell systemõs historical ability to conduct so much research inhouse, however, the federalgovernment did not emphasize support for academic research in telecommunications or otherwise encourage academia to address problems important to the telecommunications industry. university researchers themselves tended to concentrate on research areas more amenableto work by individual investigators or small research groups, such as semiconductors, communications theory, and signal processing, leaving to industry research related to the designand operation of largescale communications networks. notable exceptions, such as computernetworking research supported by the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa)and nsf (which led to the internet), illustrate the enormous potential payoff from governmentsupported and universitybased research on new architectural ideas.finding 4.2. in the wake of divestiture in 1984 and industry restructuring that followed, industrysupport for telecommunications research has declined and has also become less stable and more incremental and shortterm in outlook.the u.s. telecommunications industryõs transformation reflects both the series of breakupsof the bell system (divestiture and subsequent reorganization and spinoffs) and the entry ofnew, nonverticallyintegrated telecommunications firms such as cable system operators,internet service providers, and wireless carriers.2 at the same time, new, often internetfocused companies have also introduced products and services that help account for the broadening scope of telecommunications referred to in finding 1.some had hoped that the former bell constituents (lucent bell labs, bellcore, and at&tresearch) could sustain a high level of longterm, fundamental research investments, but thisproved impossible given the profound changes occurring in the industry. the telephone companies, facing growing competition, all but eliminated longterm, fundamental research programs, leaving responsibility for technological innovation to their equipment vendors. newtelecommunications operators in cable, wireless, and digital subscriber line (dsl) services,lacking dominance and a highmargin foundation, generally adopted the same approach. thecable industry launched its own cooperative research and development activity, cablelabs,which focuses on such matters as standards development and conformance testing and doesnot support a broad, longterm research program.an important drawback of the vendorbased research paradigm is that it is much moresusceptible to economic cycles than is carrierbased research support, because vendor revenues are linked to the rate of carrier capital expenditure, which has tended to fluctuate andthen fell sharply in recent years, rather than to subscriber fees, which tend to be more stable.it is notoriously difficult to compile definitive data on support for industry research anddevelopment, but the situation described in testimony to the committee is clearñindustrysupport for telecommunications research has decreased (as measured in dollars, numbers ofresearchers, and publications), and the work that is funded now has become increasingly2recently, there have been several mergers between what were historically local exchange carriers andinterexchange carriers, leading to greater vertical integrationñbut not integration between service providers andequipment vendors.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.62renewing u.s. telecommunications researchshortterm in focusñevolutionary rather than revolutionaryñat a time when global competitors of the united states have placed a priority on longterm research in this area. anecdotalreports indicate that basic research scientists in industry are being shifted to developmentwork and that publication by industry researchers in telecommunications journals hasdecreased.finding 4.3. in many critical technology areas, industry can look to the federal government to helpsupport fundamental longterm research. despite the decline in funding for research following therestructuring of the bell system, however, the federal government did not assume this traditionalfunding role for telecommunications, thus contributing to the current gap in support for longtermtelecommunications research.with industry having played such a large role in u.s. telecommunications research beforedivestiture in 1984, the federal governmentõs research investment in telecommunications wasunderstandably small compared with its investment in other areas of information technologyor in other industrial sectors. longterm concerns similar to those now faced in the telecommunications sector prompted the establishment of research organizations for the semiconductor and power industries, with the implicit or explicit participation of government. indeed, thecurrent situation in telecommunications is somewhat analogous to the crisis faced by the u.s.semiconductor industry in the 1980s, when international competition and decreased r&dfunding threatened that industryõs longterm viability. in response, the semiconductor research corporation and sematech were formed. their work is widely credited with havingplayed an important role in the recovery, renewed leadership, and longterm viability of theu.s. semiconductor industry (more information on sematech and related efforts can befound in chapter 2). notably, there have been no parallel systematic effortsñeither government or industryledñfor telecommunications.finding 5. in todayõs telecommunications landscape, major architectural innovation is difficult to achieve.the greater difficulty today in achieving architectural innovation involves several factors.multiple visions are now being pursued by various segments of the telecommunications industry, and although an increased diversity of players provides more fertile ground for newideas, it also makes widespread deployment of good ideas more difficult. moreover, no singleentity is able to appropriate the results of longterm, fundamental research or to comprehensively address the engineering and standardization issues associated with endtoend solutions that must span multiple service providers and multiple sectors of the industry. theresearch that can be conducted by a single vendor or sector is less well positioned to tackleendtoend issues, and the need to coordinate decisions among a multitude of players greatlycomplicates achieving major new architectural advances. as a result, vendors tend to favorincremental improvements to todayõs networks over more fundamental and highrisk research that seeks major advances in new or enhanced endtoend applications and servicesand the architectural innovation that supports them.finding 6. the roles of nsf (the largest overall federal sponsor of information and communications technology research) and darpa (a traditionally important sponsor of telecommunications research) have been evolving, with implications for telecommunicationsresearch.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.findings and recommendations63finding 6.1. long a supporter of networking research and network deployment, nsf is moving towarda more strategic emphasis on telecommunications research.although nsfõs computer and information science and engineering (cise) directoratehas long supported a networking research program, its engineering (eng) directorate supports research in such areas as wireless communications, and several of its engineering research centers have addressed telecommunications, these efforts have not reflected a comprehensive, coordinated research strategy. modest funding for telecommunications programs hasalso been accompanied by a reportedly small and shrinking proposal acceptance rate.the creation in 2004 of ciseõs network technology and systems (nets) program, however, represents an increased emphasis on telecommunications research at nsf. the newprogram spans a wide range of research topics in the control, deployment, and management offuture networks and provides a framework for interdisciplinary work. still in development asof this writing, the new global environment for networking investigations (geni)ñaimed atthe exploration of new architectural ideas in experimental facilities that allow investigation atlarge scaleñwould represent a major initiative in this area.finding 6.2. darpaõs support for telecommunications research is now focused more on meetingspecialized military needs than on stimulating broader technology advances of use for both commercialand military purposes.darpasponsored research has led to many significant telecommunications advances insuch areas as packetswitched networking, development of arpanet and the internet, optical communications, and ad hoc radio networks, as well as to the establishment of successfulu.s. telecommunications companies that are now global leaders, including broadcom, rambus,and aetheros. in addition, darpa has historically played an important role in promulgatingvisions that stimulated commercial development and adoption of new technologies, as well asin building communities of researchers. in recent years, the focus of darpa research hasshifted toward more immediate or specialized military needs. putting aside the debate aboutthe extent to which the militaryõs research portfolio should concentrate on the short termversus the long term, a consequence is the loss of an important source of support for longerterm telecommunications research.recommendationsthe recommendations below lay out steps that the united states should take to developand sustain a multifaceted, reinvigorated telecommunications research program. the recommendations envision a greater role for governmentsponsored and university research in telecommunications than has been evident in the past and also envision additional investment byindustry in more work of a fundamentally highrisk character with more attention to overallarchitectural issues. the recommendations are all aimed at socalled precompetitive activities;when the time arrives for development, implementation, and deployment, it will be up toequipment and software suppliers to create and manufacture the products and to serviceproviders to deploy the necessary facilities and services.determining how much funding to provide for such a telecommunications research initiative involves, of course, a complex set of budgetary tradeoffs among research programs andbetween research and nonresearch activities. the committee does not make a recommendarenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.64renewing u.s. telecommunications researchtion for a specific funding level but notes that funding should be consistent with the vital roleplayed by telecommunications in the u.s. economy and society and with the direct contributions made by the u.s. telecommunications industry to the nationõs economy and security.funding should also be consistent with telecommunicationsõ role as a critical element of information technology (some 16 percent of the total federal networking and information technology research and development budget today goes to telecommunications; see chapter 2).finally, the investment should be large enough to support a critical mass of researchers andresearch; one estimate can be drawn from the predivestiture bell labs, whose budget of over$500 million (in todayõs dollars) for basic research was sized to provide the breadth and depthto comprehensively address telecommunications research issues.recommendation 1. the federal government should establish a new research organizationñthe advanced telecommunications research activityñto rejuvenate fundamentaland applied telecommunications research in the united states and to stimulate and coordinate activities across industry, academia, and government that can translate research resultsinto deployments of significant new telecommunications capabilities.in light of the findings presented above, the committee believes that a new national research organization, which it dubs the advanced telecommunications research activity(atra), should be established by the federal government. this recommendation is inspired inlarge part by the enormous leaps in telecommunications technology historically attributable todarpa and bell labs and the success of broad industry consortia such as sematech.recommendation 1 and recommendation 2 below both contemplate significant federalsupport for telecommunications research. however, their full effects will come only with theparticipation of both service providers and equipment vendors. atra would provide (1) aforum for convening federal research sponsors, academic researchers, and industry to identifyresearch that is relevant to industryõs most critical needs and (2) a mechanism for the telecommunications industry to pool funds to conduct precompetitive research. government matching funds would provide an additional incentive for industry participation.in terms of structure, the committee considered the pros and cons of different models(described in chapter 4) and decided that a hybrid approach is best suited to the challengesfacing the telecommunications industry. the committee envisions atra as a hybrid of activities of the sort historically associated with darpa (which through the arpanet programmanaged a research portfolio, developed a vision, and convened industry and academia) andsematech (which brought a struggling hightech sector together, initially with some federalsupport to complement industry dollars, to fund joint research, development, androadmapping activities). atra would be staffed by program managers who would includeresearchers from both academia and industry. industry funding would represent a significantfraction of total atra funding, and industry as well as academic researchers would be deeplyinvolved in research activities.there are a number of options for where within the federal government such a programcould fit, each with its own set of tradeoffs (see chapter 4). the committee does not make aspecific recommendation for locating such a program but notes that atraõs proposed mission would align with that of existing agencies within the department of commerce and thatnsf has developed mechanisms for joint academicindustry engineering research, albeit morefocused and on a smaller scale.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.findings and recommendations65atraõs multifaceted mission would include the following (see chapter 4 for more discussion of the items below):¥identifying, coordinating, and funding telecommunications research for the nation. atraõsfocus would be on critical telecommunications research in which the nation is currentlyunderinvesting.¥fostering the conception, development, and implementation of major architectural advances.atra would place a priority on research that aims to make possible major architecturaladvances that result in the development of dramatically new telecommunications capabilities(such as the internet was when it was developed) rather than incremental improvements toexisting capabilities.¥strengthening the nationõs telecommunications research capacity by building up researchgroups, centers, and institutions with sufficient scale and breadth of expertise to tackle realworld problems and by strengthening connections between the industry and academic communities and among the telecommunications, semiconductor, and computer segments of theit industry. to provide major experimental facilities useful to but beyond the capabilities ofindividual university research groups or firms, atra would consider establishing and supporting an experimental infrastructure for such activities as fabrication, prototyping, andtesting.roadmapping (see chapter 4) would be a useful tool for (1) establishing research priorities, (2) identifying complementary investments and actions required to realize major advances, and (3) examining the interplay between technical, business, and policy considerations. atra could serve as both a neutral convener and a partial source of funding for suchactivities, perhaps learning from the role played by sematech with respect to the international technology roadmap for semiconductors (itrs)ñsee chapter 4 for a discussion ofboth sematech and itrs.longterm investments are required to realize the sorts of innovation contemplated inconnection with atra. it would likely take at least 5 years to develop a major advance (suchas a superior replacement architecture for the internet) and several more years to see thatdesign reflected in products and services in the market. but history shows that a wellconceived research program yields numerous payoffs, including shorterterm advances and unforeseen longterm benefits.the following are suggestions for specific steps to be considered in implementing thecommitteeõs first recommendation.1. establish mechanisms for carrying out projectbased research involving academia and industryand build up a core technical staff to manage research projects and coordinate activities. mechanismssuch as broad agency announcements would allow atra to solicit promising ideas fromacademia and industry. these ideas would be used to jumpstart a research program, helpestablish a critical mass of researchers, and garner sufficient industry matching funding toallow the establishment of research centers that can attract significant industry participationñorganizations along the lines of the nsfsupported engineering research centers that are described in chapter 4.atra would provide leadership by setting overall goals and objectives but should fosterrenewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.66renewing u.s. telecommunications researcha diversity of ideas and a robust competition in ideas among rival research groups. universities should receive a significant portion of funding to conduct unfettered research while educating future generations of u.s. researchers. however, atra should also address industryinterests by providing support for industry to collaborate with universities. by allocatingfunding to both universities and corporations, atra would help achieve the critical goal ofconnecting the key components for future success.2. establish advisory committees that include significant, highlevel industry participation. advisory committees with representatives from equipment suppliers and service providers wouldhelp ensure that atra is responsive to industry needs. the participation of highlevel executives is critical to both ensuring atraõs relevance and sustaining industry buyin and support for atra activities. this requirement suggests the wisdom of creating an executivecouncil that includes chief executives of equipment and software suppliers and service providers along with representatives from federal agencies concerned with telecommunicationsand telecommunications research (e.g., darpa, the national institute of standards and technology (nist), the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia),nsf, and the federal communications commission). additional advisory committees mightbe established to address individual major technology areas (e.g., optical and wirelesscommunications or network security) or the interplay between technology and regulatorydevelopments.3. explore future needs for r&d centers and shared facilities to complement distributed, projectbased research. there are a number of research problems whose investigation might ultimatelyrequire centers or shared facilities. for example, characterizing and improving the securityand reliability of a largescale communications network, especially when it comprises multiple interconnected service providers that use diverse technologies, requires a much broaderperspective than can be brought by any individual or group of individuals. centers may alsobe a way to more efficiently provide certain experimental facilitiesñsuch as for fabrication,prototyping, and testing. for example, research that depends on fabrication of integratedcircuits or other devices may require access to facilities that are beyond the reach of a universitybased research group. finally, centers provide a nucleus for academicindustry collaboration and for interdisciplinary research.there are several plausible options for establishing r&d centers: establishing universitybased centers in which industry participates, extending the mission and size of a governmentlaboratory such as those at nist, or establishing a federally funded research and developmentcenter for telecommunications research. selecting the appropriate types and mix of institutions would be an important task for atra and would depend on industry interests andinstitutional capabilities. research priorities that emerge from visionsetting and roadmappingactivities would also help inform the design of such centers.4. establish a forum in which lawmakers, regulators, research funding agencies, and industry canshare knowledge about technological developments, visions and roadmaps, and policy and regulation.to maximize the leverage of establishing atra and increasing industry participation in r&d,it is essential that lawmakers and regulators understand the impact of legislation and rulemaking on the r&d enterprise, and that both they and researchers consider and reflect in theirthinking the interplay between the policy environment, business opportunities, and technological directions.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.findings and recommendations67recommendation 2. the national science foundation and darpa should assess theirinvestment in basic telecommunications research and consider increasing both their emphasis on and their level of investment in such research.even with the creation of atra, both nsf and darpa will retain important roles instrengthening u.s. telecommunication research. both have successful research managementcultures that complement each other and the activities envisioned for atra. in particular,both have been very effective at identifying, building up, and supporting research communities in areas of national interest.as a starting point and as a periodic activity, both nsf and darpa should look acrosstheir programs to determine how much funding is actually being directed to telecommunications research and should then develop criteria for establishing the appropriate level of funding going forward. relevant criteria include (1) the size of the telecommunications researchcommunity and the number of highly rated proposals that can be funded, (2) the size of thetelecommunications industryõs r&d budget, and (3) provision of support for telecommunications research within the broader it research budget in proportion to the size of the telecommunications segment compared with the size of the it industry as a whole.recommendation 2.1. the national science foundation should continue to strengthen its support fortelecommunications research.nsf has significant strengths in supporting basic research, training researchers, and building research communities that can play an important role in strengthening the u.s. researchbase in telecommunications. ciseõs growing commitment to supporting research in this areais evident, and the committee encourages nsf to sustain such attention.in addition, and reflecting the greater emphasis being placed in this program area, nsfshould also consider establishing programs aimed specifically at attracting and developingyoung research talent in telecommunications. options would include supporting graduateand postdoctoral fellowships in telecommunications or establishing a younginvestigator program that would provide startup support for promising research talent, targeted at telecommunications.finally, existing mechanisms such as the cise advisory committee or new ones, such asformal or informal consultations with the director of the proposed atra, should be used tokeep abreast of new ideas, major challenges, and promising research directions emerging fromacademia and industry.recommendation 2.2. darpa should continue to invest in telecommunications research for militaryapplications even if there is some chance that the commercial sector will develop such technologies.in light of the importance of maintaining a cuttingedge telecommunications capability ina networkcentric military, darpa should periodically reexamine its investments in telecommunications. factors to consider include (1) the telecommunications capabilities attainable bypotential u.s. adversaries by virtue of the burgeoning commercial telecommunications sectoroverseas and (2) the risks associated with having to rely on components and systems that areincreasingly being developed overseas. darpaõs role would be complementary to that ofnsf and the proposed atra. compared to nsf, for example, darpa has a culture of focused programs with more active management and significant industry participation.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.68renewing u.s. telecommunications researchrecommendation 3. all segments of the u.s. telecommunications industry should increasetheir support for additional fundamental research. one avenue would be through participation in joint, cooperative research activities organized by the proposed atra.as described above, the emphasis of industry research in recent years has shifted towardshortterm product opportunities within the context of existing overall network architecturesand away from the more fundamental and highrisk opportunities and major advances incrosscutting endtoend applications and services and supporting architectures that are essential to the longterm health of the u.s. telecommunications sector. both equipment vendorsand service providers (including providers of wireline telephony, wireless, broadband,internet, satellite, and cable) should consider identifying and using mechanisms through whichthey could provide more support for fundamental research. atra, proposed in recommendation 1, is intended to provide a way for the telecommunications industry to pool funds,spread risk, and share beneficial results through cooperative efforts between industry andacademia that are jointly funded by industry and government.renewing u.s. telecommunications researchcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

the federalgovernment on technical and public policy issues relating to computing and communications.composed of leaders from industry and academia, cstb conducts studies of critical nationalissues and makes recommendations to government, industry, and academia. cstb also provides a neutral meeting ground for consideration of complex issues where resolution andaction may be premature. it convenes discussions that bring together principals from thepublic and private sectors, ensuring consideration of key perspectives. the majority of cstbõswork is requested by federal agencies and congress, consistent with its national academiesõcontext.a pioneer in framing and analyzing internet policy issues, cstb is unique in its comprehensive scope and its effective, interdisciplinary appraisal of technical, economic, social, andpolicy issues. beginning with early work in computer and communications security, cyberassurance and information systems trustworthiness have been crosscutting themes in cstbõswork. cstb has produced several reports that have become classics in the field, and it continues to address these topics as they grow in importance.to do its work, cstb draws on some of the best minds in the country and from around theworld, inviting experts to participate in its projects as a public service. studies are conductedby balanced committees without direct financial interests in the topics they are addressing.those committees meet, confer electronically, and build analyses through their deliberations.additional expertise is tapped in a rigorous process of review and critique, further enhancingthe quality of cstb reports. by engaging groups of principals, cstb obtains the facts andinsights critical to assessing key issues.the mission of cstb is to¥respond to requests from the government, nonprofit organizations, and private industryfor advice on computer and telecommunications issues and from the government for advice oncomputer and telecommunications systems planning, utilization, and modernization.¥monitor and promote the health of the fields of computer science and telecommunications, with attention to issues of human resources, information infrastructure, and societalimpacts.¥initiate and conduct studies involving computer science, technology, and telecommunications as critical resources.¥foster interaction among the disciplines underlying computing and telecommunications technologies and other fields, at large and within the national academies.cstb projects address a diverse range of topics affected by the evolution of informationtechnology. for further information about cstb reports and active projects, see <http://cstb.org>.82
