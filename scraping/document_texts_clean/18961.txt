jodi swidzinski hezky, ph.d. d. e. shaw research 120 west 45th street, 39th floor new york, ny 10036  dear dr. hezky:  this letter describes the work and transmits the final report of the committee on proposal evaluation for allocation of supercomputing time for the study of molecular dynamics, fifth round.  the committee evaluated submissions received in response to a request for proposals (rfp) for biomolecular simulation time on anton, a supercomputer designed and built by d. e. shaw research (desres). over the past four years (october 1, 2010 œ september 30, 2014), desres has made an anton system housed at the pittsburgh supercomputing center (psc) available to the noncommercial research community, based on the advice of previous national research council committees convened in 2010 œ 2013. as in prior rounds, the goal of the fifth rfp for simulation time on anton is to continue to facilitate breakthrough research in the study of biomolecular systems by providing a massively parallel system specially designed for molecular dynamics simulations. these capabilities allow multimicrosecond simulation timescales, which previously had been unobtainable. the program seeks to continue to support research that addresses important and high impact questions demonstrating a clear need for anton™s special capabilities. the success of the program has led desres to make the anton machine housed at psc available for an additional 3,300,000 nodehours over the period following october 2014, and desres has asked the national research council to once again facilitate the allocation of time to the noncommercial research community. the work of the national research council committee to evaluate proposals for time allocations was supported by a contract between d. e. shaw research and the national academy of sciences and was performed under the auspices of the national research council™s board on life sciences.  to undertake this task, the national research council convened a committee of experts to evaluate the proposals submitted in response to the rfp. the committee of 16 was chaired by dr. angel garcia, department head and professor of physics, and senior constellation chaired professor in biocomputation and bioinformatics at rensselaer polytechnic institute. the committee members were selected for their expertise in molecular dynamics simulations and their experience in the subject areas represented in the 55 proposals that were considered by the committee. they comprised a cross section of the biomolecular dynamics field in academia, industry, and government including both senior and junior investigators.    report of the committee on proposal evaluation for allocation of supercomputing time for the study of molecular dynamics: fifth roundcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.2 the anton rfp described the three criteria against which the committee was asked to evaluate proposals:  scientific merit, including the potential to advance understanding on an important problem or question in the field; potential for breakthrough science resulting in new discoveries and understanding; the impact that successful completion of the proposed research would have on knowledge, methods, and current barriers in the field; and a scientifically and technologically feasible project with clear, welldeveloped, and appropriate goals, objectives, and approach to the proposed studies. justification for requested time allocation, including a clear and welljustified need for multimicrosecond simulation timescales and a clear and convincing justification that the length and number of proposed simulation runs and nodehours requested are necessary and sufficient to achieve the scientific objectives.  investigator qualifications and past accomplishments, including the appropriate experience and training to successfully conduct the proposed studies, evidence of knowledge and prior experience in molecular simulations, and past publications.  proposals from investigators who had previously received an allocation of time on anton were required to include progress reports. following guidance provided by desres and psc, the committee drew on these progress reports as supplemental material in its consideration of proposals. the committee also received information from psc on the number of nodehours of simulation time remaining on 2013 anton allocations.1 as explained in the rfp, staff at psc conducted an initial assessment of all proposal submissions for completeness and to determine whether they were technically feasible for simulation on anton. a member of the psc staff was present as an observer throughout the review committee™s discussions to address any additional questions that arose on anton™s technical capabilities or on how the computer will be made available to researchers during the period of the project.  the committee was asked to identify proposals that best met the selection criteria defined above. as in the previous rounds of anton time allocations, 100,000 nodehours was the maximum amount of time available to a proposal. principal investigators could also request a lesser time allocation. the committee was further asked to allocate at least 25% of the time to principal investigators who had not previously received an anton allocation. the judgments of the committee are based on which proposals best met the selection criteria described above and on the estimates of required simulation time provided by the applicants. the committee was permitted to consider a modified time allocation if it concluded that the proposed research required a greater or lesser number of nodehours than initially requested by an applicant.  initial reviews of the proposals were provided by the 16 committee members. each proposal was assigned a minimum of two primary reviewers who were asked to evaluate the proposal based on the rfp and guidelines described above. review assignments were made so that proposals were not evaluated by reviewers from the applicant™s same institution or who had close collaborative relationships with an applicant.  1 this information was provided as of august 12, 2014. the committee was advised that approximately two months of simulation time remained on the 2013 round of allocations, and thus investigators who had not yet used their full allocation of simulation time may still be able to do so. report of the committee on proposal evaluation for allocation of supercomputing time for the study of molecular dynamics: fifth roundcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.3 the committee held its meeting in washington, d.c. on august 15, 2014. at the meeting, members undertook a detailed discussion of the proposals. the two primary reviewers were asked to summarize their review for the committee, which was followed by discussion of the proposed research. as described in detail above, committee members considered the scientific merit, justification of the requested time, and the qualifications of the principal investigator and key personnel. the committee then considered the slate of proposals, came to a consensus on which proposals it judged best met the selection criteria, and, in some cases, decided to suggest a modified allocation of time on anton. detailed comments for each of the 55 proposals are included in appendix b. the committee has often included constructive suggestions for improvements in the research plans, which is of significant benefit to the broader community.  the committee concluded that the proposals listed below best met the selection criteria set forth in the rfp for biomolecular simulation time on anton. of these 45 proposals, 18 proposals were selected for a modified allocation (identified below with an *).  in numerical order by proposal submission number, the proposals judged by the committee as best meeting the selection criteria of

the 45 proposals identified, 23 were identified at the approximately 100,000 nodehour level and 22 at the 50,000 nodehour level.2 a total of approximately 1,128,000 nodehours were allocated to 17 proposals whose principal investigator did not receive time on anton during the past four years (identified as ﬁnew usersﬂ). approximately 34% of the available simulation time thus was allocated to new users of anton. the remaining 2,175,000 nodehours are allocated to 28 proposals from investigators who had received allocations of time on anton in previous rounds (identified as ﬁreturning usersﬂ). in carrying out its task, the committee identified as many promising proposals as possible given the constraints on the total available simulation time.  the committee also wishes to raise two questions that arose during the proposal discussions. the first involves the restriction stated in the rfp that ﬁeach investigator can serve as a pi for only a single application for computer time on anton.ﬂ it is common for proposals to include copis and other key personnel in addition to the stated pi. the committee observed that it was also common for experts in molecular dynamics simulations to be associated with multiple proposals.3 the committee encourages d. e. shaw research and the pittsburgh supercomputing center to consider whether additional guidance on the maximum number of proposals with which a senior investigator may be affiliated would add clarity to any future rounds of proposal solicitations.  2 the 100,000 nodehour level is defined as proposals that were identified for 70,000 nodehours or greater. the 50,000 nodehour level is defined as proposals that were identified for less than 70,000 nodehours. 3 with the intention solely of pointing to an example from among the current round of proposals, professor benoît roux was listed as pi on one proposal and copi on two additional proposals. this type of situation was not unique to professor roux. report

committee encountered a request for simulation time awarded in the fourth round (20132014) to carry over into the fifth round of allocations (20142015). in this instance, the committee declined to recommend a time extension. however, the committee would like to note this request so that d. e. shaw research and the pittsburgh supercomputing center can consider whether a policy on time extensions should be made.  the committee would like to thank d. e. shaw research, the pittsburgh supercomputing center, and all of the 2014 anton applicants for the opportunity to assist in identifying the proposals best meeting the selection criteria for time allocations on the anton machine. the committee members were universally enthusiastic about the potential advances in the field that are facilitated by anton and are looking forward to seeing the important new results from the anton users.  sincerely,  angel garcia chair cc: dr. markus dittrich, pittsburgh supercomputing center dr.
