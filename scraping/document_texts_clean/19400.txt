cohosted by the advisory board on the built environment (abbe) of the national research council and the national computer graphics association in conjunction with the world computer graphics association. the congress provided an opportunity for invited persons from federal agencies to meet with members of other agencies, professionals in practice, and experts from the computer community. the congress attracted over 2600 people of which 550 attended the tutorial and/or technical sessions. of these, approximately 200 were federal personnel invited by abbe's federal construction council. the federal tion council provided partial support for the planning of the congress, with individual registration fees and corporate exhibit fees providing support for the operation of the congress. abbe's committee on computers/graphics planned the technical portion of the congress, invited the speakers, and organized special federal user group meetings for agency personnel. this committee included experts from universities and industry, as well as liaison representatives from federal agencies. the world computer graphics association arranged all nonfederal registrations, planned the tutorial sessions, and managed the fiveday event. the national computer graphics association's principal responsibility was to organize and manage the exhibits. twentyseven companies and zations participated as exhibitors at the congress. purpose federal agencies that design, construct, manage and operate buildings are rapidly finding that there is an increasing advantage in converting their existing procedures to ones that are computer based. because it is technically possible to represent a building as a collection of images or drawings that can be input to a computer display and lated as computer data, a number of agencies are beginning to require their architectural and engineering consultants to provide based documents. this has required most agencies to form user 1 a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.2 committees to manage the transition from existing manual practices to those which are computer based. agencies are also finding it necessary to provide technical information and training for their staff, including briefing sessions for upper management. in a field that is changing as rapidly as computer graphics, it is difficult, even for those who are reasonably wellinformed, to keep abreast of changing opportunities. the congress on computers/graphicss in the building process emphasized the federal users of computerbased systems. invited agency representatives met in ten special topical sessions to discuss the need for and nature of establishing federal user groups for computerbased design and engineering. the recommendations that emerged from these sessions will form the basis of future abbe activities in this field. organization invited federal personnel were joined at the congress by building design practitioners (architects and engineers), computer experts, representatives of computer companies, and other professionals. ticipants from the private sector represented many of the organizations that provide computerrelated support required by federal agencies. the interaction of the public and private sectors at the congress contributed to a better educated and more capable support community. the general theme of the sessions in the congress was on methods for improving the building process through computers and computer graphics applications. tutorial sessionsintensive application and educational workshopswere held on the first two days of the congress and were sponsored by the national computer graphics association. the remaining three days consisted of technical sessions, exhibits and the special federal user group meetings. the keynote address was delivered by james h. burrows, director of the institute of computer sciences and technology of the national bureau of standards. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.2 a look at the past and the future promises of computer technology the keynote address by james h. burrows director institute for computer sciences and technology national bureau of standards washington, d.c. april 6, 1983 i am glad to be here and to speak briefly to you at this, the second international congress on computers and graphics in the building process. today, i thought i would try to put some perspective on the developments in the computing field, then give you some advice and issue a challenge. when i was a child, and after radio, flying, and driving biles had become commercial, if not universal, my dad commented he was born 30 years too soon. i was almost 30 before i entered the computer field, and i also have the feeling that i was born 30 years too soon. however, i'm not sure pac man is really an improvement over pinball machines and punchboards. it only costs more. when i entered computing i did it in a big way, joining the team at mit's lincoln labs that was building the semiautomatic ground environment, sage. we had a computer of 32 bit word length, although only 16 bit arithmetic and no floating point. we had 100 remote displays within the building and could accept inputs from about 20 radar sitesfrom more than 100 operators in several identical centers hundreds of miles away. fifteen to 20 teletype input/output devices entered flight plans, and so on. the bare computer cost $615 million depending on whether it was simplex or duplex. the physical size, power and heat dimensions of the machine are hard to believe. the machine had sk32 bit words of main memory, 32k bytes of main memory. i could stand between the two shower stall size boxes holding that memory. today most machines in the $200$500 range have more memory, and the computers supporting rudimentary cad/cam have more computing power than that vacuum tube behemoth that supported sage. 3 a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy

computing have sparked enormous growth in the use of computers. today, cessors are finding their·way into a wide range of devices from the automobile to electronic games to intelligent computer terminals, personal computers and mainframes. with the increased use of ters, there has been a tremendous increase in the types and amount of information that are being recorded and used. managing and using new technologies and information resources effectively will be challenges in the years ahead. i believe that we can expect continuing developments in the future, driven by advances in very largescale integrated electronics circuitry. hardware developments will continue to be the most dramatic, but i believe that we will see significant improvements in software and data base technologies also. advances in integrated circuit and computer technology are often measured by the density of components on a chip and the number of operations per second that can be performed. circuit densities of 64,000 components or more per chip are available in the market place today. a 32bit microprocessor announced recently has chip complexity of 450,000 transistors. by 1986 we can expect densities of up to 1,000,000 components per chip for logic. this complexity has been achieved by shrinking the size of the individual components. with the dense packing of circuits comes improved reliability, primarily through the elimination of connections. today's circuits are 10,000 times more reliable than they were 25 years ago. a designer of one of the larger ibm compatible machines expects his next machine to run half a year between scheduled preventive maintenance. in the area of processing speed, some of today's large computer systems are approaching 100 million instructions per second. the cray company has announced a machine of 300 million floating point tions per second. this machine is scheduled for the late 1980s. the practical limits facing integrated circuit technology development are mostly the problems associated with heat dissipation as circuit densities increase. secondarily, there are problems with the inherent propagation delays between components within the chip (limited to the speed of light). many of these advances are possible because of computer technology and automated design, manufacturing, and testing techniques. automated design of chips with 5,000 to 30,000 gates is now possible, and larger designs can be done semiautomatically. the cost of logic and storage components also continues to drop while speed and complexity increase. because of their small size per memory bit, their high speed, and their low manufacturing cost, semiconductor memories are used almost sively and are expected to continue to be used through the 1980s. a vax 780 power machine will be on your desk in 1990 at a cost of less than $5,000. our estimates of the user costs in cents per 1,000 bits show continued reductions. for example, fast semiconductor random access memory costs 300 millicents per bit today. in ten years, that cost will be in the range of 2040 millicent& per bit. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.5 magnetic disks will continue to improve as mass storage gies improve. flexible disks, for example, are in widespread use for both information storage and information transfer. lowperformance flexible disk drives for the standard 5 1/4 inch disks are very inexpensive, and the more recent 3 inch disk drives may do even better. the technology of flexible disks is behind that of rigid disks, but it is improving. because of their cost per bit advantage over solidstate alternatives, they will continue to be used for online files. buffered disks, using a semiconductor or bubble technology, are likely to be used in large systems with large files and high activity. input technologies have changed very slowly, and not much change is anticipated for the next five years. the operator at the keyboard will still be the principal mode of capturing information, although this technique is probably not the most natural way for people to interact with computers. however, improved keyboards are appearing in which numerical key fields and special control keys complement the traditional alpha/numeric key arrangement. these capabilities increase productivity and operator comfort. also, touch screen capabilities are making it easier for people to use computers. more natural input using voice, for example, will develop slowly. voice input systems still have very limited vocabularies, and continuous speech recognition systems are not expected during this decade. output technology has changed the usercomputer interface cantly. estimates are that between 5 and 10 million workers use video display terminals today, perhaps 4 percent of the work force. by 1990 one out of five workers will use a computer work station. the cost of standard terminals is expected to be in the $50 to $100 range in the next few years. special terminals with color options and high tion are expected to cost between $1,500 and $2,000 by 1985. panel displays using plasma technology have been around for some time, but they are expensive and have poor resolution. largearea displays based on this newer technology are expected to be commercially available before 1987 at prices in the $200 to $300 range. the growing interest in graphics display for computeraided design and animation has led to the creation of threedimensional perspective images, mostly through improvements in software for providing shading. however, progress toward true threedimensional displays is much slower. considerable research and development work is underway in japan. in general, however, the transmission and reproduction of threedimensional images has, to date, not permitted practical tions because of the complexity and the volume of information required in the recording storage. other output technologies are also improving, particularly voice synthesis, and impact and nonimpact printing terminals. declining costs have characterized hardware development over the past 25 years. studies by ibm show that since 1950 the overall costs of small, general purpose computers (as defined by the instructions executed per second) have been decreasing at a rate of about 25 percent per year. the rate of decrease for larger general purpose computers has been about 15 percent per year. computers are also decreasing in size. some experts predict that a fivemillioninstructionspersecond computer will fit into a threeinch cube by 1990. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all

portion of the total costs of system development. the systems and applications programming account for about 85 percent of total system cost. applications programming is by far the largest portion of all programming costs. software development and maintenance continue to be labor intensive and complex with perhaps twothirds of all programmer time spent on maintenance and modification of existing software. promising developments in software will help users make better use of computers and permit programmers to become more productive. the operating system interfaces of large systems are beginning to disappear from the user's view. these are being replaced by easiertouse, more logical interfaces in the higherlevel support software systems such as compilers, database management systems, and job scheduling systems. another trend in software is the development of software tools that improve programmer productivity. software products that perform input, processing, and output are available in the market place. these products will gradually replace today's programming languages for most applications. they will require more hardware resources as a trade off for their user friendliness, but these resources will be available and inexpensive. we can also expect improvements in file management. by 1987 four related, but distinct, kinds of products should become generally available: 1. database management software that provides extracts of tional data bases for decision support and multiple user view of data; 2. file searchers for limited collections of data and text; 3. storage hierarchy managers that provide access and control for large data bases resident in multilevel hardware hierarchies; and 4. readonly systems using video disks with text and image capabilities. with the development of userfriendly systems and with greater familiarity with computer systems on the part of the users, computer professionals will take a larger role in developing their own systems and solving problems without the services of the computer professional. the other major technology that influences our future use of puters is communications. the telephone network that currently connects telecommunications and computer equipment and services was developed for voice transmission. we can expect in the 1980s and 1990s that integrated digital communications links for the transmission of facsimile, voice, and data will become available. the increased development of computer graphics systems is apparent. improvements in software for graphics, along with decreased costs of hardware, are making graphics systems widely available for a broad spectrum of applications such as design, instruction, business, and entertainment. not long ago, graphics systems were oneofakind systems. they were awkward to use and would usually occupy an entire a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.7 room. the crt technology for graphics display is being constantly improved, and the limitation of two dimensions is currently being investigated. in the graphics area standards will play an important role in facilitating the exchange of data, drawings, and associated records. the american national standards institute is conducting work on ing results to three dimensions while polishing and simplifying the draft international standard, graphics kernel system (gks) of the international organization for standardization (iso). the air force sponsored a project in the aircraft industry that nbs coordinated to produce iges, the initial graphics exchange system, a standard data base format for exchanging design data between design systems. one waste evident today is our inability to exchange and use data between activities without bringing it out of the machine to paper and reentering from paper (whether manual or automatic). there have been some developments where a document that is machine produced is both human readable and, through special symbolic areas, also machine able. the merchandise product code now used by retailers is such an example. in this case the numbers and the special code both appear. i'd like to get to my advice now. first, it is clear that the underlying support technology is increasing in capability and is decreasing in cost. the false start that occurred in the 1960s in the use of computers in the building process is past. there are clearly costeffective uses today, and they should be encouraged. many of the future benefits discussed at this conference are stream from design and drafting. these need a data base from which to start; regenerating from scratch is not cost effective. many of the uses are islands of capability not connected to other uses. this may be appropriate for initial development, but loose federations of applications look feasible and cost effective. no other field will supply the one missing element to the construction industry. that is a coherent process and data model, tightly integrated or not, that will allow the flow of data between and among the several participants. this is of paramount importance for the longrange health of the field. however, "analysis paralysis" will set in if you wait for the ultimate, and no progress will be made. from just a perusal of the conference program, it is clear to me that the issues are joined, and that progress is under way. i think i'm correct when i tell my son i was born 30 years too soon, although i must agree that i am living in an interesting time. thank you. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.a report from the congress

by the national computer graphics association on april 4th and 5th, the first two days of the congress. tutorials were independent, educational sessions that offered an indepth examination of special areas of computers/graphics applications in the building process. each threehour session was accompanied by resource materials that were prepared by the instructor. the tutorials were developed based on suggestions by the abbe committee on computers/graphics, a survey by the world computer graphics association of user interests, and on suggestions by 1982 congress participants. the tutorial sessions were: 1. "getting started in computer graphics: what's it all about?" joel t. orr orr associates, inc. danbury, connecticut 2.

"advanced applications: case studies of computer applications in architectural practice" william mitchell graduate school of architecture and urban planning university of california, los angeles technical program the technical portion of the congress consisted of 45 sessions spread over the final three days of the congress, april 6th through 8th. the sessions were organized and conducted by abbe's committee on computer/ graphics. fiftytwo experts from universities, industry, and federal agencies participated as speakers or panelists in the program. the sessions consisted of presentations, panel discussions, and question and answer sessions. the technical program was open to all registered congress participantsinvited federal personnel, private practitioners, industry and university representatives. while the focus of the technical program was oriented to the needs of federal users, it was also designed to be of general interest to the nonfederal personnel present. agencies that use the services of private professionals can benefit from having those professionals wellinformed on this developing technology. the program was organized around three themes: the use of computers/graphics in building design; the use of computers/graphics in managing the building process during construction; and the use of in the management of facilities. the sessions were equally divided between sessions that were of interest to those technically involved with computers and their use, and sessions that were of interest to the managers of organizations that are, or will soon become, users of computers/graphics systems. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.11 selected summaries

organized for invited federal users and managers of computerbased systems. nearly 200 federal agency personnel participated in the eight sessions (see appendix iii for names of attendees). the purpose of these firstever meetings of interagency personnel was to discuss in an informal manner the need for and the nature of establishing interagency user committees. seven of the user group sessions dealt with special interest topics and were designed for those members of federal agencies who were experienced users of computerbased systems. the special interest topics were: ł computer graphics

users and addressed the question: do we want to have user groups in the future? lee garrett, the chairman of the abbe committee, led both general sessions. summary of general sessions participants at the general sessions of the federal user group meetings endorsed the concept that interagency user committees of federal sonnel involved with computerbased systems and construction programs should continue beyond the initial efforts established at the congress. efforts to organize such user committees should include consideration 15 a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.16 of every agency in the federal construction council that is currently using computerbased systems or that is considering the use of such systems. in addition, the private sector should be involved at some point in the development of such user groups. this could involve private sector companies providing exhibits at user group meetings for handson applications of stateoftheart hardware and software. this ment of private sector companies would be one step removed from sales demonstrations; it would involve companies agreeing to demonstrate applications in an educational mode. participants agreed with the concept that user committees should be organized along the lines of "special interest" areas. user mittees should be organized across agency lines according to subject areas. the special interest topics for federal user groups at the congress are examples of possible subject areas for such committees. for user committees to be effective, they should address ment of new concepts, new tools, and new processes. user committees should go beyond simply addressing the automation of current practices. participants felt strongly that user committees must have agency management behind the effort, both in terms of the initial formation phases of such committees and throughout the life of the committee. summaries of special interest sessions the following section summarizes the federal user group sessions that dealt with special interest topics. each moderator posed three tions to the group for discussion. they were: 1. under this subject, what are the areas of common concern for each agency represented here? 2. is there a need for some type of joint activity among the agencies represented here? 3. what form should such activities take? as can be seen from these questions, the special interest user groups were not designed as technical discussions of the topics involved. they were meant for discussion among participants about the need for some type of organizational activity on the topic. session moderators report their findings below. computer graphics library this session was moderated by neal davis, u.s. army corps of engineers, huntsville, alabama. 1. areas of common concern: under the subject of computer graphics library, the principal areas of common concern are details, symbols, text and levels or layers. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.17 2. need for joint activity: participants voiced a need for a users group among agencies on this subject. 3. form of activity: although no plan was articulated by cipants, there was agreement that there should be one lead agency with representatives from each other interested agency. expansion of computers/graphics among contract architectural and engineering firms this session was moderated by ron king, general accounting office, washington, d.c. 1. areas of common concern: the consensus of the five agencies represented in this sessionu.s. army corps of engineers, naval facilities engineering command, u.s. air force, united states postal service, and veterans administrationwas that there are a number of areas of common concerns including: ł specifications; ł standards; ł cost estimating; ł standard details; ł policy of passing work around; ł six percent limitation on design fees; ł fee structure; ł contract documents; and ł data sources and pooling of data ł 2. need for joint activity: there was unanimous agreement that there was a need for some joint activity among agencies. at some point this activity should involve the private sector and the policy making agencies of the government such as the office of management and budget. 3. form of activity: it was less clear what form such activities should take. the federal construction council was discussed as a possible forum, but all construction agencies are not members. it was felt that different types of activities may be necessary. initially, a forum to define the specifics of the problems is needed. managing a cad installation in the government this session was moderated robert tilley, veterans administration, washington, d.c. 1. areas of common concern: common concern voiced. 2. need for joint activity:

d.c. 1. areas of common concern: areas of common concern include languages, data portability, and validity and maintenance of ing software systems. 2. need for joint activity: participants voiced a need for some type of interagency activity in this area. 3. form of activity: there should be a joint committee of sible federal agencies. private concerns including manufacturers should be included in some manner. in addition, consideration should be given to a central clearinghouse (for more than federal agencies) for specifications, symbols, and user information. integrating cad systems into the design process this session was moderated by thomas kenney, u.s. army, washington, d.c. 1. areas of common concern: common concerns among those present include the lack of exchange between systems including attributes, and planning and specifying what is required from a system. 2. need for joint activity: participants voted yes. 3. form of activity: user committees should be established. these should consist of federal agencies with representation by the american institute of architects and selected computer manufacturers. it was felt that federal agencies must come together to force the computer industry to address problems in this area. data exchange standard this session was moderated by janet spoonamore, construction engineering research laboratory, champaign, illinois. 1. areas of common concern: concerns include the types of data being transferred in terms of structure and content. management commitment was seen as crucial. 2. need for joint activity: participants voted that some type of activity is needed. 3. form of activity:· establishment of an iges subcommittee should be considered. justification/procurement of computers/graphics systems this session was moderated by larry kaetzel, national bureau of standards, washington, d.c. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

division naval facilities engineering command alexandria, virginia while in its infancy, computer !s beginning to emerge as a powerful tool in the building design industry. today, applications are available to support the principle phases of the design process. analysis programs are used by most engineering disciplines. computer graphics can be used to generate final drawings. word processing efficiently produces specifications. systems are used to prepare cost estimates. major design and construction benefits can be achieved by using proven construction details and standard formats. however, in seeking to provide competitive advantages for their products, vendors often use unique procedures that make it impractical to automatically transfer results between design applications developed by different vendors. for example, a construction guide specification library maintained on vendor a's word processing equipment cannot be effectively used on vendor b's equipment. furthermore, computer graphics equipment required to realize the benefits of reusing standard symbols and details may be too expensive for a small architectural engineering firm. this presentation will cover these issues and others that must be considered before federal construction agencies, such as the naval facilities engineering command, can require computer generated contract documents. 1d

although architectural computerization is in its infancy, a remarkable computeraided synthesis of all major aspects of design practice is already under way. the synthesis can be visualized as a network or web of software modules that include: the scope of services checklist; predesign and plan programming criteria; building and zoning code criteria; spatial allocation and schematic design; financial feasibility study; preliminary construction cost estimating; design development and production drawing budgeting and scheduling; design development decision checklist and job record; working drawing planning checklist and decision record; consultant coordination criteria and checklists; working drawing construction detail files; working drawing notation and keynote files; outline specification files; final construction cost estimating; shop drawing coordination and checking; layering of base and overlay sheets in design and production drawings; division of repetitive data and coordination of computer graphics, pasteup graphics, and overlay reprographics; documentation control and checking; construction occupant survey; postconstruction design and construction services. much of the foregoing is now available as software. the rest is all under development and should be available in 198384. most will be available for the small microcomputers, all will be provided for use with minicomputers with graphic capabilities and mainframes. it will be possible for the design team and client to proceed, through interaction with the machine, stepbystep through every decision that is made in the design/production/ project management process. each decision made, whether tentative or definite, initiates a search for all data relevant to that decision including other decisions that may be affected by it. reasons for decisions are also recorded at the time made and revisions in decisions call forth the entire string of implications of such revision. a total tion of the entire design and management process is created and updated reports regarding any aspect of the design, project management, or later facilities management will be available upon demand at any time. most significantly a large amount of decision making that traditionally has been made at different times by different people (often in conflict with one another) can now be made in a single stroke and objectified and quantified in its repercussions both in text printout and computer graphics. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national

building prooł ła:a quality control of contract drawings produced by computeraided methods neal g. davis, pe u.s. army corps of engineers huntsville division the huntsville division (hnd) has been using a fomputer qesign and qrafting (cadd) system since 1978 for the preparation of construction documents. the system is used to efficiently input, store, manipulate and retrieve both graphic and graphic data. projects range from site development drawings to architectural building design documents. procurement, installation and initial production. significant productivity increases using cadd have been established and well documented. to achieve these increases, a large commitment of resources by top management must be applied at the procurement, installation and initial production of a cadd system. it is very difficult and time consuming in the federal government to obtain approval and install a highly productive cadd system. many times the system is outdated by rapidly changing state of the art before it has achieved the high productivity ratio. quality control. the best quality control may be achieved by the forced ization of cadd drawing document elements, which helps to insure a better construction document package, and better coordination between disciplines and drawings. in the building design process, a cadd system is faster and more accurate in performing tedious, repetitive and time consuming tasks, freeing the user for more creative design. the user develops more interest and better morale which results in a better design. data exchange between different systems. the corps of engineers is transferring data between cadd systems using the standard interchange format (sif). translators were developed to interchange data between the corps usedcadd systems of applicon, trol, intergraph, gds and sketch. in addition to sif, the national bureau of standards has approved the initial qraphics (ices). both standards require a tremendous effort of communication standardization and software translator development for successful data transfer between different systems. advantages. advantages have been well documented based on cost benefit ratio and/or drawing productivity. six other areas of justification have been identified. a better quality product can be produced, shorter project span times, integrated data base with the drawings, improved techniques such as changing scale and "what if" exercises, 3d enhancement, and manpower augmentation due to the fact that qualified engineers and draftsmen are difficult to locate, acquire, and keep.l/ summary, a better construction document package may be produced because of quality control methods developed while using a cadd system for design and construction. 1/s. h. chasen

"'"1m the precise manner in which facility management is defined is often specific to a particular organization and depends on a variety of organizational characteristics. as organizations grow in size, the way in which facilities are planned, used, and managed evolves and corporate expectations of facility performance expand. although most facilities departments coordinate outside contracting of tasks and services, the facility management function itself should be an internal function. responsibilities of facility managers although no two facilities organizations look or operate exactly the same, there are generic management functions that inevitably occur in all of these organizations. at the most general level, facility management can be described as an ongoing process of planning, implementation, and monitoring. within the three functions of planning, implementation, and monitoring there are seven basic activities: analysis, forecasting, project development, project management, operations, maintenance, and inventory. facilities include the entire range of physical assets of an organization, including land, buildings, rooms, work stations and equipment, and supplies. computer needs of facility managers the results of a recent survey of facility managers' needs for computerization will be presented. graphics a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building

angeles, california "''1m the term "facilities management" has recently crept into our vocabulary. it is a misused term by those who use it. we have "facilities management" computer systems. we have "facility managers." we have "facility management" courses. and we have "facility management" computer applications. we do not have fac.ili ty managers. we don't know what they should do. do we have any idea what facility management is and who facility managers are? ... or should be? facilities management must be viewed as the process of applying management sciences to the complete process of programming, planning, developing, constructing, occupying, evaluating, and managing the we use in our work. the emphasis must be placed on the word management. management entails abilities in planning, directing, organizing, projecting, justifying, observing, and operating. applying those management skills to facilities creates the field of facilities management. it is more than planning, and having a list of the furniture units. what then is a facility? it is certainly more than furniture and the space we work in. facilities are all of the productive resources we have in the work environment that we find necessary to perform our responsibilities. facilities include the office, factory, warehouse, and even open space within which we work plus the furniture, fixtures, equipment, tools, and environmental support systems we need within those spaces to perform our functions. thus, facilities management entails all of the productive environment we have in which to perform our work and requires all management skills to be directed towards the built environment. to manage facilities effectively we must have products, a process, and qualified personnel. these are the three components of a facility management system. one of the products may be a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

computer. computers can help the facility manager accomplish four tasks: productivity enhancement, sales aids, design enhancement, and decision aids. unfortunately, too much attention is given to the sales aids and design enhancement areas and far too little attention is given to using computers to increase the manager's ability to make decisions. the process of facility management is cyclical and must begin with longrange planning, continue through the analysis of alternatives, and exercise certain design, planning and implementation tasks. the process requires a facility manager with very broad experience in many disciplines that is not academically oriented but is only found in the school of experience. to manage facilities more effectively we need to develop and place qualified facility managers that understand this process, increase management's awareness of the importance of facilities on achieving overall goals and objectives, develop the necessary products (including computer applications) to aid in this management process, and to replace what has been a "reaction" orientation with one that is action oriented. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in

largescale computer graphics for its facilities program should be prepared to undertake a major effort that requires the investment of a substantial amount of time, money, and personnel resources. some of these are: preparation of the system justification documentation required by the regulations and procedures of the various automated systems procurement offices within or outside the particular organization; early identification of the system operational personnel; provisions for training, site preparation, equipment layouts and office space arrangements; and agencywide visibility efforts by appropriate briefings and presentations that will assure continuous top management support. these are issues that the naval facilities engineering command (navfac) is currently addressig in its efforts to implement a computer graphics system. navfac is obtaining a system fo its headquarters, its six engineering field divisions (efds), the naval civil engineering laboratory, and the public workds centers (pwcs). called the graphics design system (gds), it will be fully implemented over the next several months. for an orderly implementation, gds hardware and software will be installed at the efd's over two years. the first system was installed in january 1983 at the atlantic division, norfolk, virgiania, and another in march 1983 at the western division, san bruno, california. installation at the remaining efd's, the pwc's, and ncel will be completed in 1984. before the equipment is installed, a systems manager, a systems engineer, and an applications engineer at each field activity will attend training courses and seminars at the vendor's training center. gds users will be trained on site after the equipment has arrived. the training includes courses on the needs of each a/e discipline and will prepare middle and top level management for a smooth transition to this ew way of doing business. update courses will inform managers and users of the latest

libraries. these libraries are necessary for the cost effective and efficient use of gds. libraries will be updated based on the experience gained with the prototype systems. a quarterly or semiannual validation and update cycle by the library standards committee is projected during the installation phase. approved libraries will be distributed by magnetic media on this cycle. quality control will be provided by spot checking a random sample of completed project drawings. the development of gds should have a major impact not only within government but also in the private sector. navfac is one of the largest design and construction organizations in the world, dealing with more than 1,000 a/e firms annually. many a/e's are already using computer graphics and the acquisition of graphics equipment is growing rapidly. recent reductions in computer prices and improvements in software capabilities allow even small a/e firms to purchase inhouse turnkey systems. navfac to contract a/e services with firms having computer graphics capabilities. the ability to transmit graphic schematics via telephone with remote interactive manipulation of these schematics will drastically reduce the time that a/e and navfac personnel spend in reviewing/changing drawings and specifications ongoing projects. this interchange, however, requires compatible systems owned by government and indistry. today, the data bases of graphics systems on the market are not totally compatible. the government has recognized this problem and, with help from industry, has developed the initial graphics exchange specification (iges), a tool for passing geometric information between two graphics data bases. however, iges is still in a conceptual form and further development is required for teu graphical and textual interchangeability of data bases. navfac is supporting the efforts of the iges committee to secure public acceptance for these standards and to write a translator that incorporates the iges concepts for facility design applications. with the expectation that the use of praphics by the a/e community will mature by the time the gds is fully and developed, navfac is monitoring the a/e community to determine when to incorporate graphics capability as a selection factor in the statement of requirements published in the commerce business daily. currently, however, navfac is following

provides design and construction ment expertise to such federal agencies as the department of the army, ment of the air force, environmental protection agency and other foreign governments upon request. this multibillion dollar construction program translates into a heavy managerial workload at the lowest level of the corps, the area office. the area office staff acting in the role of the "owner", must control such administrative issues as review and approval of shop ings, issuance and timely resolution of change orders, maintaining a quick response time to contractor letters and requests for information and verifying the status of the contractor's scheduled work. as the representative of the contracting officer, the area engineer must have access to valid and cient quantities of information to make such decisions as to whether or not the contractor deserves additional performance time because of change order issuance or disruptions to the work. in concert with the u.s. army corps of engineers, construction ing research lab (cerl), the wrightpatterson air force base area office, louisville district, u.s. army corps of engineers, has been conducting a two year field test to determine if the owner should have an inhouse mini computer to manage office administrative issues and to provide more cogent formation to support the decision making process. the computer being tested is a digital equipment corporation pdp 11/23 with proprietary, offtheshelf software from structural programming, inc., sudbury, mass. the computer allows the user to perform three types of software applications. they are: 1. network analysis (critical path method of project scheduling) the contractor's schedule is maintained in the computer and updated as project work progresses. access to the official network schedule permits detection of progress slippage, inhouse analysis of potential time extensions prior to change order negotiations and provides other types of useful information to the owner. 2. data base management this capability allows the improved control of such issues as shop drawing control, change order tracking, status of claims against the government and other applications premised on large volumes of information. 3. text editing allows increased flow rate of letters by simplifying the drafting and revision of correspondence. this session will summarize what the computer is, what the do, application of the system, positive results and a discussion encountered during the field test. computer can of problems 23c a report from the congress on

oak ridge, tennessee 24c large construction projects involving installation of high technology equipment present problems of management control in terms of size, technical complexity and environmental restrictions. planning to provide management timely access to information on quality status and adverse trends must begin concurrent with overall project schedule planning. successful data management and analysis begins with planning for the sources of data; methods of collection and transfer, and analysis and presentation thereof. first, the problem of providing quality status, involves finding some ways of measuring quality achievement and providing status indicators of such achievement, i.e., getting the data, analyzing it, and reducing it to a reportable format. obviously, one cannot report on every item in the plant to the same level of detail; this would serve only to clog the system, create unnecessary expense and frustrate those whose responsibility it is to sort through and trend analyze such information. therefore, methods must be utilized to sort out the important items on which quality data will provide an indicator of the level of quality achievement in the project as a whole. by using the technique of risk analysis one can make a subjective analysis, later backed by more objective technical analysis, to determine those important items, areas and processes whose failure would materially affect safety, cost, schedule or 11fitness for intended use .. (quality). having prepared such a list of items, one can then specify and implement special actions which will eliminate or decrease the probability of failure or minimize the consequences thereof. the record of accomplishment of these special actions is quality status data which should be tracked by inclusion into a data base which is updated as the actions are completed or changed. once decisions are made as to items for which qualityrelated data should be collected, then decisions can be made as to what kinds of data bases and software programs are needed to collect and analyze such data. decisions must also be made on the types of reports required, the use of such reports, frequency of such reports and to whom they must be sent. · this paper will amplify on the preceeding

eastman formative technologies inc. pittsburgh, pennsylvania current cadd systems, while effective in capturing a completed design concept on computer media, are ineffective in supporting exploratory design development. they offer users a rigid, poorly structured environment, not conducive to creativity and visual problem solving. a new style of drawing system is needed to support creative design. it must be highly flexible, making it exceptionally easy to: alter and edit drawings; to produce design documents; to replicate portions of drawings; and to undertake simple forms of analysis. the following features outline the design of a new type of drawing system that supports both efficient production of drafted documents and also creative visual and graphic problem solving. 1. it must include freehand drawing and allow the storage and manipulation of such drawings. 2. it must allow easy conversion of freehand drawings into ruled drawings and contract documents. 3. it must support dynamic editing, with accurate dynamic scaling of lengths and locations. 4. it must incorporate powerful structures within the drawing, that allow parts to be copied or edited, singularly or at various levels of aggregation. 5. it must allow all effective means to manage graphic information with multiple displays and continuous pan and zoom. 6. it must allow production of complete drawings without pasteups or manual composition. examples of the use of such features will be discussed and their contribution to design explored. 2bd (;raphics a report from the congress on computers/graphics

new york, new york a eo the most familiar use of the computer for facility programming is to store and organize space use data, and to calculate and tabulate square footages. six years ago at hok we wrote an inhouse system to do this. it was fairly simple, ran only in batch mode, and was designed to do little more than create very nice space lists. we were happy with it for a while. but we realized that our batch system lacked three features: 1) we had to rely upon others (outside the project team) to process and generate our reports, sometimes resulting in delays. 2) it did not enable us to store and reuse information from project to project. 3) it did not help us analyze such qualitative issues as functional groupings, schematic planning, value engineering and budgeting. in addition, we did not have any special features to help the client understand the significance of his data, approve it, and when necessary make choices. about eighteen months ago, we started working on an inhouse system which would do all this and do it for both interior design and architectural design over a broad range of building types such as office, r & d, health care and correctional facilities. the system is called hok space©and has many special features which are still not completed. however the basic system is operational and we have begun to use it on projects. i'd like to share with you a brief description of hok space© system features which i think have special significance in conceptual design: factors different circulation factors can be used for each organizational group and for each of three different record categories: personnel, support and equipment records. in addition, addon factors with adjustable labels can be applied to both project level and group level totals. this flexibility enables us to obtain "space totals" which are tailored to project terminology (eg, "rentable square feet," or "lab modules") and to create different models for testing design assumptions. computer congress a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.60 summary (continued) session 280 gary silver forecastingthe will always try to calculate space values where detailed data may be missing. it does this by using several "topdown" indicators which are entered at the outset to act as defaults. this enables the designer to assess detailed facility needs for time periods beyond which a client may be able to provide detailed data. fore, a strategy for orderly growth can be formulated in the design. data base catalog certain types of information have application over many different projects. the depth of our knowledge increases with each project completed because each project contributes to the data bank. the computer enables us to aggregate this universal information and access and use it easily. i predict that this is the area where we will see the most innovative new applications. a few years from now we will be doing much less "custom" programming and relying more on applicable norms and data bases which we will merge with specifically collected program data. this will not only save programming and design time but reassure the client who wants to know that what he is doing makes sense in the context of his business or institutional category. our initial step in this area will be to build catalogs of standard equipment records which contain detailed characteristics and attributes. attributes we can assign an unlimited number of attribute codes to any record or organizational group and then sort our records by each of these attributes. this enables us to find out how many and where special needs may exist such as 24hour air conditioning, plumbing, or heavy structural loading. interactive operations interactivity helps us in at least two ways: 1) 2) since each project team is responsible for entering its own data and running its own reports, we can more reliably schedule the processing and completion of our projects. therefore, priority conflicts are minimized. interactivity also means that we can query the data base and construct custom reports which respond specifically to questions or needs expressed by the client or designer. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building

describing the need for groups to be located together, directly from the spokesman of each group. however, we can also collect and process such information from thirdparty sources (such as senior managers). the resulting "scores" which define adjacency priorities are printed out both as a listing and as an interaction matrix. wherever conflicting scores exist for the same ship, they are "optimized" to a single score. making some sense out of the resulting array of scores can be a formidable task on a large or complex project. we are presently adding a system feature which will enable us to consolidate scores under any list of specific groups. therefore, an overview of the relationships between major functional clusters can be quickly and easily seen by specifying a consolidation report for those major groups. graphic cluster analysis the most logical and useful extension of space and adjacency data is a graphic display which portrays the data in a building context. this is also the initial step in computer aided conceptual design. hok is now in the process of adding cluster diagramming, stacking analysis, and block planning features to our space© system. as an initial step we are investigating the purchase of existing software products, because we would prefer to buy something we like rather than write our own. currently we are evaluating the stack and block programs of an independent consulting firm by using those computer programs on some of our projects. we hope that will work out. however we have the option of looking at other software, or having our own computer group create what we need. ultimately our goal is to link our space© system directly to our computer aided design and drafting system hok draw© ł frankly, we're just beginning to scratch the surface in understanding where that will lead. as we progress, perhaps it would be an appropriate subject for another conference. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building

engineers, as a major design and construction agency, must strive to reuse and standardize designs for a wide range of facility types. a system for doing just that, yet allowing enough flexibility for unique user requirements, has been established. the system was first developed for tactical equipment maintenance ties and is used during various phases of programming, planning and design development. the system is comprised of tac shop, a programming tool; a design information system (dis), which selects designs for possible reuse; and the building standardization and design system (bsds), which is used for early design development. to standardize the criteria used for programming facilities, tac shop provides the installation's facility engineer with a space program to match his needs. the first inputs to this program are based on the specifics of the facility, such as the numbers and types of personnel in the facility, the table of organization and equipment (or toe) number, and any special facility requirements like a paint shop or battery room. the program then provides the user with a detailed breakdown of the squarefootage ments for the facility, including all critical spaces, support spaces, and unassigned squarefootage such as circulation space and wall area. the program even provides a breakdown as to how much space is to be provided on the second floor compared to the first floor. the total gross squarefoot requirement is the significant figure required at this time for planning and programming. the other information is retained for use during project development. the next input to the program is required to calculate the support facilities on the site. this input is based on the numbers and types of vehicles to be maintained, and the number of companies (or organizational structure) using the facility. the output provides the facility engineer a complete breakdown of support structures required, parking and paving required, and miscellaneous requirements including such items as the linearfoot of fencing. once the design district is given a notice to proceed, a search for an existing design, standard design or definitive design will be made in hopes of finding a suitable design to be reused. the design information system (dis) is used for this search. the inputs required are the specifics of the project in terms of the functional space program (provided earlier from tac shop), the number of companies, and the organizational structure. the output is a suggested list of previous designs that may be site adapted, site adapted with minor modifications, used with significant modifications, used as a guide or not used. the user can check the appropriateness of an existing design by listing a comparison of his new project and the historical project, or projects. this comparison provides the user with a detailed listing of the variances between the designs, and a list of other factors such as modifications required for seismic, snow or wind loads. if there are no historical designs that are suitable, the user has the option to proceed to the next level, which is the building standardization and design system (bsds). if this option is desired, dis provides the user with a list of standard modules that are required. congress a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building

of modules provided by dis ultimately result in a completed sketch design for the specific project (based on a number of quickly developed alternatives). the final sketch design can be further developed using a computeraided drafting system or by manual drafting. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

system use in preliminary design: in the last year our medical facilities design office (mfdo) has begun to use computer tools as standard practice. as a result, project architects and engineers (aes) hired by the corps of engineers to design medical facilities are becoming very familiar with the information produced by the computer, if not with its actual operation. at this time our aes, while encouraged to use computers, are not required to use a computeraided design (cad) system for their design work. the following presentation describes how the mfdo came to use computer tools (particularly in the early stages of design), some examples of two clinics and a hospital recently designed, and when and how these tools are used in working with project aes. design of medical facilities is unique from other acquisition processes for three reasons. first, the design covers a very wide range of disciplines. second, design within an individual discipline is normally more complex. finally, there are more participants and a longer acquisition process than is found in other types of design. in addition, the corps' district and/or division offices that are involved in design are scattered throughout the country. to address the concern about increased cost of providing medical facilities while providing an acceptable health care capability, a congressional house subcommittee directed the department of defense to study the situation. the mfdo was established following recommendations from this study. as a new office with the major responsibilities of managing all medical design through the concept phase (35 percent) and monitoring the design through the final phase (100 percent), we looked to the computer for tools. two tools, bds/gds (an integrated cad system) and docfr (a corpssponsored design review system), were found and are providing excellent assistance. 3dd a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary (continued) session 30d r. bruce dains 66 the first tool is a large integrated architectural design system called bds/gds (building design system/general drafting system). we are using it in the early phases of the design process. criteria development use centers around entering and maintaining drawings and diagrams which illustrate design requirements in our corps of engineers technical manual 53832. this is the main document that a medical project ae is expected to use for design guidance. preliminary design, however, is the major thrust of the use of bds/gds. through the production of a preliminary design package by a separate mfdo support ae, facility design quality has been improved and the design process has been shortened. on selected jobs, this computer documented package is produced while the project ae is being selected. it provides all the necessary information in an organized manner as well as initial direction for design. three or more alternative design schemes are produced with merit analysis dealing with measurements, materials, costs, heat, and lighting. design development is relatively quick and it permits evaluation of a full range of options in siting, circulation flow, layout, energy efficiency, and costing within a shortened time period. the project ae is included in review conferences during the development of the package. following completion of his selection, he is presented with the full package which gives him a significant head start in the concept design phase. over the past year three preliminary design packages were developed by our support ae, leo a. daly co., located in omaha, nebraska. this ae firm developed packages for the camp humphries and camp casey army medical clinics and the minot air force base hospital. an example of the benefits of using these packages was immediately seen when we were able to keep the hospital design from slipping a year in the design program. although design time was shortened, we were able to analyze many design schemes. this provided the project ae with better design information and allowed him to finish concept design at an early date. this was a direct result of the preliminary design package process that was facilitated by using the bds/gds system. it is expected that as computer tools in the design area become more widespread, a medical project architect will find it even more beneficial to receive the preliminary design package directly in his computer and then proceed with design on his system. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary (continued) session 30d r. bruce dains 67 the second computer system, docfr (design office computer format for review), provides assistance in handling medical project design review comments. comments are made by government professionals reviewing the project ae's design submittals. developed by our support ae, the system allows design review comments to be entered, stored, updated, and reported. this format, coupled with the ae submittal guide, that indicates what is to be submitted and who is to review it, provides a more comprehensive review. in addition to aiding the organization of the comments for use during review conferences, it greatly assists the review of subsequent project submittals to verify ae response to previous guidance. immediate access to review comments is available to all involved review agencies. the system also provides a method to enter construction evaluation information and, because of the unique disciplineoriented format, allows comparison to previous project comments. the system is now being used on two hospital projects. as a result of the demonstrated benefits, it will be expanded to include new medical projects as they come into the design program. in conclusion, i would like to make a few observations about the relationship between architects and the computer applications community. so far we have seen how the ae can begin to interface at an early stage. design is the architecture key word. at present many architects are sitting back and saying "show me". on the other hand the computer applications community is saying "see what we can do. these tools have fantastic capabilities. fit your operation to them and you will gain great advantages." i believe its now time to switch roles, and you are beginning to see it here at the conference with many advanced firms showing their systems (maybe not developed inhouse, but at least modified to fit their needs). the architectural firm can be a form giver in the area of automated tools. but in order to do so the ae firm must get involved. get your feet wet, so you can use the skills that are uniquely yoursorganizing and interfacing needs with innovative solutions. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the

expectations. graphic (cad) and business computer systems are advertised to architects as better, faster, bigger, cheaper, productivitymultipliers, etc; but these terms provide nothing more than vague but enthusiastic encouragement to buy, buy, buy. most design professionals are completely aware that computers are a big part of their future, but they have no yardsticks for predicting the realworld benefits (or lack of them) in their own practices. therefore, the experiences of researching, planning, evaluating and implementing computers in their offices proves to be confusing, contradicting, and frustrating, and no progress is made. the presentation then proceeded to provide quantified data in the topical areas of: current computer activity in architectural practices; a survey of how time is spent in architectural offices, and the portions of those time investments amenable to computerassist; a description of the "architectural practice database", and what tools, computer and manual,

full cycle of facility management in the future jim steinmann steinmann, grayson, smylie, inc. los angeles, california facility management in the future should be decidedly different 3bm than facility management is today. unfortunately, most practitioners view facility management as the control of space, overseeing the orderly development of more space, and keeping the space user satisfied. it is viewed as "building" or "space" management. facility management demands significantly greater skills and an improved process to be truly effective in the management of cant capital resources just as similar management systems have previously been responsive in business and government in managing financial and human resources. facility management is a recurring and cyclical process that begins with ideas and concepts, defines goals and objectives, and develops a long range plan of action. facilities require a long time to develop. they are not very responsive to major changes in the goals of business or government. facility managers need to plan effectively for the future as much as they plan the efficiency of the space they are responsible for managing. facility managers are currently given the responsibility to administer a small portion of the cyclical facility management process that of reacting to external stimuli and implementing direction provided by other managers. given the need for extending the field of facility management, it is necessary to extend the areas of computer applications available to the facility manager. current technology exists to provide the facility manager with resources necessary to accomplish goals and objectives, to minimize lifecycle costs, and to maximize space utilization. current available computer applications tend to concentrate on implementation oriented applications data base management, space and furniture inventory, automated space planning, and implemention budgeting and scheduling. very few applications are (}raphics a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.(continued) session 36m jim steinmann 78 available to truly help the facility manager manage facilities. the process of managing facilities is different than the process of implementing a facility action. it is necessary to establish a facility management system that includes a process, a number of products from workstation standards through computer data bases, and personnel to administer the process. some of the more important products are computer applications to help the facility manager. a number of existing computer applications are available and can assist implementation activities. other applications are developable in that technology and interest is there while others are mere possible thoughts on the horizon. the more important applications those aimed at the management side of facility management need further efforts to become available. the most important of these applications are those that provide decision aids to management to help project needs, analyze data and develop planning models. an organization should identify the types of information needed to computerize the facility management system and assess the development potential of each. once the components are identified, the zation should analyze existing systems and, when current applications are not adequate, develop a performance specification for the system so that new software will be within the overall context of the total space system that will eventually evolve. the facilities management system will benefit by establishing a high level of authority within the organization to make necessary decisions. the availability of an adequate staff is mandatory. in the future, with a facilities management system including personnel, products, and procedures in place, the importance given to facilities will increase and the problems that are always blamed on facilities will be reduced. a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.79 cornputere/ ciraphlce '83 interactive threedimensional topological modeling james p. corbett independent consultant florence, massachusetts in designing a system for cad it is important to adopt a complete and correct geometric model. the most appropriate model for this purpose is the three dimensional cellular complex. in particular, the most suitable form is the cwcomplex introduced by j.h.c. whitehead (1948). the presentation begins with a description of such a model. the cwcomplex is the most suitable form for the construction of the carrier topology. in this topology the closed sets are the subcomplexes. exploitation of this topology results in many simplifications of the detection of interferences and the enforcement of continuity conditions at structural boundaries. the theory is also exploited in producing homeomorphic cellular maps. such maps permit one to incorporate independently coded details as integral parts of a structure. one of the most important consequences of the exploitation of this model is the facility with which preliminary designs may be created. one may rough in an approximation to a structure with only approximate dimensions. one may compare different preliminary solutions to a design problem without entering into elaborate dimensioning and detailing. a rough design is easily turned into a finished structure once the major design alternatives have been compared. 37d a report from

with the entire lifecycle of the designconstruction process and providing capabilities for all of the various disciplines involved in the process, have an even greater potential for improving productivity and the quality of the final ture. however, a variety of issues are currently limiting the full potential of such systems. when one looks at the total building design and construction process, some issues and problems become apparent. first, due to the separation of the process into stages {plan, design, review, construct) and the separation by discipline (structural, electrical, mechanical, etc.), there is a fragmentation of the overall process. this results in a situation where design data is fragmented, yielding problems of how to best handle all of the design information. second, design and construction are influenced by the tory process (codes and standards). dealing with these in the computer is a difficult task with many technical problems. third, current computer applications are in the form of algorithmic programs, with every contigency, option, and possibility considered a priori. because of the complexity and indeterminate nature of the process, development of complete, comprehensive algorithmic programs is impossible. these issues combine to limit the effectiveness of computerintegrated design systems. within recent years, several computer science technologies which are quite beneficial in the development of computer applications for the building process have emerged. two aspects look most promising. relational database management systems (with their ability to deal with data on an organizational basis rather than on a representational basis) treat some of the data handling problems caused by industry fragmentation. expert systems (an application area of artificial intelligence) provide mechanisms for dealing with illstructured problems and provide an alternative to algorithmic programs. in dition, constraint enforcement in databases and knowledge representation in expert systems are both related to handling codes and standards. thus, these technologies provide promise for developing improved computerintegrated design systems, but some open issues and search remains before complete systems enter production. congress a report from the congress on computers/graphics in the building processcopyright national academy

graphics exchange specification (iges) program has focused the efforts of 52 companies on the development and documentation of a means of graphics database exchange among present day cad/cam systems. the brief history has seen the evolution of the specification into preliminary industrial usage marked by public demonstrations of vendor capability, mandatory requests in procurement actions, and a formalization into an american national standard in september 1981. recent events have demonstrated intersystem data exchange among seven vendor systems with a total of 30 vendors committing to offer iges capability. a full range of documentation supports the iges project and the recently approved iges version 2.0 of the specification. 43d c;raphics coxgress a report from the congress on
