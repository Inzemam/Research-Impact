undertaken regarding new demands that are being placed on world data centers (wdcs) and associated national data centers by largescale geophysics programs. this recommendation was strongly supported by the grb. thomas malone, man of the grb, then asked carl savit to visit data centers in the united states and to prepare a letter report on his findings. the main text of that letter report follows: geophysical data of the more traditional types falling within the sponsibilities of the centers are handled efficiently and economically. data management is excellent from the point of view of filing and trieval procedures, data editing, compilation, data conditioning, and dissemination. response to requests appears to be uniquely well ed to the needs and requirements of the user community. in part, the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation may be attributed to the virtual identity of the communities of users and pliers of data. the data are submitted in a format that is readily vertible to useful forms by wellestablished techniques. editing and taxonomic functions are within the realms of expertise of the technicians in the centers and are primarily carried out manually or with the aid of simple analog devices. in contrast to this wellordered and stable data flow, new forms of data are beginning to appear. these new forms are primarily terized by being several orders of magnitude more voluminous in mation content than the old types of data. they generally appear on magnetic tape in one of a variety of digital (or sometimes analog) formats. all steps performed on the old types of data will necessarily have to be performed in some fashion on the new types of data. these new data will require editing, formatting, condensation, summarization, excerpting, and other derivative processes. to effect these requirements, a profound change will have to be made in the organization, staffing, and funding of the world data centers. access will be required to powerful and largescale digital computers. specialpurpose processors will probably have to be designed, built, and procured. staffs of programmers will have to be employed and trained, and scientific guidance will have to be provided to these programmers. 1 geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.2 storage facilities suitable to magnetic tapes will have to be vided. printout facilities under the control of edp equipment will have to be available, and inventories of specialized materials will have to be maintained. all the above procedures will require very substantial initial funding and a considerable increase in continued funding levels. the approach to datauser and datasupplier costs and charges will have to be reexamined. the supplier community and the user community will certainly be, at least in part, disjunct. it is quite probable that a large fraction of the user community will be interested only in rized, generalized, or abstracted data, and will be unable to pay any substantial part of the costs of obtaining such derived data from the massive files of raw data. a number of other problems and caveats stemming from the advent of the newer types of data are visible to one extent or another at the present time. every aspect of the new data forms and new data content that have already begun to appear imply an exponential rise in data quantity, with the concomitant implication of substantial impacts on administration, staffing, and funding. subsequently, the geophysical data panel (gdp) of the cdidc was formed, with mr. savit as chairman. the charge to the gdp was to amplify and substantiate the findings of the letter report. the resulting report consists of two parts. in the first part the ings and recommendations of the panel are set forth and discussed. the ation of some typical world data centers and associated national data centers is described, and the impact of new data forms and quantities on them is sidered. the second part contains the results of a survey of digital data quantities from past, ongoing, and planned largescale geophysics programs. the growth of the task of data centers can be measured in several dimensions: 1. budget for largescale geophysics programs 2. number of programs 3. number of nations involved in programs 4. the extent and resolution of geographical coverage 5. the amount of data generated the figures pertaining to data quantities in the second part of the report serve to emphasize the importance of the main issues to which this report is addressed: 1. the increasing expectations of benefit and growing investment by domestic and foreign government agencies and national and international entific bodies in largescale geophysics programs; 2. the urgency of ensuring the effective dissemination of the knowledge gained in such programs so that those benefits will be realized; 3. the central role of world data centers and their associated national data centers in accomplishing the dissemination of that knowledge. geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.some typical data centers the data centers discussed below are treated in more detail in a cdidc report.1 the appendix lists present holdings of the data centers, including traditional data forms. conversion factors for information content of a few tive forms are given in that appendix. services related to traditional forms continue to be important. services related to digital data are considered below. each of the centers discussed consists of a world data center and an associated national data center. most of the resources of the centers are devoted to the tion of the national data centers. the world data centers serve special functions as described in the guide to international data exchange through the data centres and depend heavily on the facilities and resources of the associated national data center. the national geophysical and solar terrestrial data center (ngsdc) has on file approximately 600 reels of magnetic tape containing digital data. a cdc6600 computer is used for batch computation. an xds940 timesharing system is also available. computers are used on a parttime basis only. proximately 20 percent of the budget is devoted to computer services. the national climatic center (ncc) has on file approximately 77,000 reels of magnetic tape containing digital data. a univac series 70/45 computer is used full time, and four other computers (raytheon 703, daconic 3630, packard 9830, and wang 700) are used on a parttime basis. ncc, in cooperation with the air force, is in the process of procurement of a new computer. imately 25 percent of the budget is devoted to computer services. data from the global atmospheric research program (garp) atlantic tropical experiment (gate) are available from the computer products branch of the national climatic center and are archived by wdca for meteorology, which is collocated with ncc. data from the first garp global experiment (fgge) will be similarly handled. the national oceanographic data center (nodc) has on file approximately 60 reels of magnetic tape containing digital data. an ibm 360/65 computer is used on a parttime basis. approximately 20 percent of the budget is devoted to computer services. the national space science data center (nssdc) has on file approximately 41,000 reels of magnetic tape containing digital data. an ibm 7094 is used full time, and ibm 360/75 and 360/91 computers are used on a parttime basis. approximately 15 percent of the budget is devoted to computer use. 7 geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.8 each of these centers also has large files of data recorded in tional formats, such as photographic film, punched cards, and printed data sheets. each center is experienced in meeting requests for data in these forms. generally speaking, most of their resources are devoted to meeting such requests, a task that they discharge effectively (see appendix). geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.new demands on data centers less developed countries although the technologically developed countries are the biggest users of the woes, both in terms of volume of data and numbers of requests, users of the wocs, including regular users, are to be found in virtually all the countries that have participated in the international geophysical programs. moreover, responses to the survey that led to the report an assessment of the impaat of the world data centers on geophysias1 indicated that the world data centers have been particularly important to scientists in the less developed countries because of the lack of national data or scientific centers in those countries. in the future, the world data centers are likely to take on a sharply increased importance in connection with the less developed countries. the beginnings of this are already evident. plans for the global environmental monitoring system call for use of the woes. the proposal has been made (law of the sea conference) that data obtained on oceanographic vessels in the territorial waters of other countries be made available through the world data centers. the world data centers are apparently accepted throughout the world as an effective handed mechanism. some of the future programs are likely to be of specific interest to the less developed countries. future planning regarding the wocs should give careful attention to efforts to make them more responsive to the needs of the less developed countries in connection with basic science and practical problems. in particular, there will be a need for more highly cessed data products designed to meet the needs of users lacking hightechnology resources. data volumes the data centers may be expected to encounter difficulties in meeting requests for data products derived from the kind of dataintensive programs described in part ii. the most apparent source of difficulty is the contrast between the volume of digital data generated by these programs and the volumes with which the data centers are accustomed to dealing. to take an example, only 9 geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.10 one (there will be five) of the synchronous meteorological satellites (sms) in the first garp global experiment (fgge) will generate about 5 x 1013 bits of digitally encoded visual information over the 18month fgge period. to record these data on conventional 2400foot reels of 1600 bpi computer tape would require 200,000 to 400,000 reels of tape. world data centers and the associated national data centers generally are able to deal with relatively small numbers of tape reels of this type as discussed above. but they clearly will not be able to deal effectively with a large number of programs each of which may generate volumes of digital data several orders of magnitude larger than those to which they are accustomed without some major adjustments in organization, staffing, and funding. several other aspects of data handling may also present problems. geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.aspects of data handling retention it is not clear that it is practical to attempt to retain raw data volumes of the magnitude discussed above. assuming that the data can be compressed with the aid of new technology, access time becomes a limiting factor. if we assume a processing speed of about 10,000,000 bits per second, it would require 75 days to process the output of one fgge sms. with present technology, then, it would be difficult to make such data bases available for the exclusive use of any but a small set of wellfunded users. this difficulty might be partly overcome by scheduling times when specific subsets of extremely large data bases would be put online for simultaneous access by a large number of users. it should be noted that commercial facilities do exist that store and provide access to even larger magnetic tape quantities. computer technology is advancing rapidly, and what may appear today to be an almost unmanageable problem may seem much less formidable in the near future. there is strong evidence that performance of computers is growing exponentially.2 should data volumes also grow exponentially, then at any given future time, the volume of newly acquired data will dwarf that of old data. should such stances obtain, discarding old data will have a negligible effect on required storage capacity. therefore, if economic factors compel a decision to discard data, this decision will necessarily have to be directed primarily at the new data sets. the acquisition and preservation of data from large geophysics programs should be systematized and accomplished in a coherent way. general criteria should be formulated for the acquisition of data taking into account, among other things, format and data quality. some provision should be made for ing with the various formats peculiar to each discipline, but some limits will have to be imposed on the variety of formats with which the data centers will be required to deal. these objectives were met very effectively in the ning of gate. however undesirable it may be to thin or discard data, limited resources may nonetheless force a decision to do so. such a decision should be taken only with the greatest circumspection. the international scientific community should be notified of the intent to destroy data so that the tunity to take action to preserve them will not be lost and so that the munity will have the opportunity to make provisions for retaining data of 11 geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.12 special significance. examples of such might include data associated with unique geophysical events or phenomena, unprocessed data in which reduction processes destroy information, or data that cannot be taken again simply cause geophysical events do not repeat themselves. a decision to discard data can be costly in the sense that the expense of storing data is generally less than that of acquiring it. indexing data are organized and indexed according to the objectives or exigencies of the program generating them. for example, for experiments covering a large area, it is often necessary to employ an array of field recording equipment generating a set of tapes each of which contains data in chronological order associated with a particular location. it may be desirable to reorganize these tapes into a form in which all data coded according to location and responding to a given time are grouped together. in the most general sense, a datum corresponds to a point in a multidimensional coordinate and parameter space. different indexing schemes allow one to examine different sequences of subspaces. it is advantageous to anticipate indexing schemes that will be needed by secondary users and to put the entire data set on line to generate in one operation special data sets correspondingly organized. anticipating such needs is important, since the largest aggregate demand for data comes from secondary users. data center staff must not only have mastery of plinary fields but must also maintain close contact with the datausing munities. levels of processing the degree of processing of data can be characterized in the following way: i. raw data ii. data processed to yield physical parameters iii. data interpolated according to a standardized array of points in space and time this characterization was developed in the gate program, and we use it generally. the higher the level of processing, the more compact is the data set. one criterion that has been proposed for data retention and that would reduce the data volume flowing into data centers considerably would be to tain only the level iii data set. as can be seen from the appendix, for the fgge, the level iii data set is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the level i data set. obviously, however, such a compression must involve considerable loss of information. for example, the processing of level i spectral data to produce temperature profiles is not a reversible process. geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.13 but spectral data have diverse uses. thus, information of potential use might be lost if only the level iii data set were retained. at least some subsets of raw data should, in general, be retained, not only for their information content per se but also to facilitate tracing of processing. use for secondary purposes of data from scientific programs will in general require reprocessing. such reprocessing requires trained personnel and a hierarchy of computing bilities. storage the amounts of data that may be expected to be retained in data centers are such that, to provide prompt access, a hierarchy of mass storage systems will be required. ideally, the storage systems would have sufficient capacity and flexibility so that specially processed data sets could be produced cally. with advanced technology, storage of even the fgge level i data set would not be particularly difficult. a volumetric compression factor of almost 200 is possible with videotape data storage. use of videotape would reduce the number of tapes necessary to store the fgge geostationary satellite data to about 5000 tapes for five satellites for the entire fgge period. for purposes of comparison, the national climatic center has available for purchase 5986 sms1 tapes containing visual (vis) and infrared (ir) imagery on a conventional 1600 bpi tape format. thus videotape storage should make storage of the fgge level i data set no more difficult than that of the gate sms vis and ir imagery. however, as mentioned before, access is limited by processing rates for fgge level i data. it would be straightforward for data centers to make available individual videotapes, but a user requiring a special subset of the data set would have to have access to the entire set. if the electronic dataprocessing staff and facilities necessary to prepare special data sets are not provided by data centers, some users would have to purchase the entire data set, most of which they might not need, and process it themselves to accomplish their objectives. that is already the case for the gate vis and ir data sets ed on magnetic tape. should this trend continue, data centers will increasingly become repositories for data that are effectively inaccessible to the majority of potential users. an alternative to storage in data centers is to rely on informal ments with outside centers (e.g., universities) to maintain data sets. data centers would then provide referral services. without formal arrangements, data centers may lose control over the data sets, and it can be anticipated that as programs in outside centers are phased out, data sets would be carded. geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.14 accessibility if data centers are to ensure the preservation of information and availability of data products from large programs in accessible forms, advisory services and equipment will have to be provided to assist users in extracting needed data products. for many users, interactive facilities are desirable in order to allow optimization of the data products that they receive. planning of data handling must encompass archiving and retrieval. dataacquisition systems and format specifications should be designed not only to make possible efficient processing of data for the purpose of extracting and organizing physical eters but also to maximize accessibility of information to users. realization of the benefits of largescale geophysics programs depends on the effectiveness with which information is shared, which in turn depends on the ability of data centers to disseminate information. program planning must take into account not only experimental design and data analysis but also archiving and retrieval. the entire path of information flow, beginning with data acquisition in the experiment, including data analysis, and ending with archiving and retrieval, must be considered with the overall goal of providing maximum access to formation. careful experimental design and data analysis are necessary but not sufficient to accomplish that goal. costs data centers will need additional support, either direct or indirect, for new activities and services associated with increased demands on them. direct funding must provide part of the additional support, but it may be unrealistic to expect these demands to be met entirely by increases in internal budgets of data centers and charges to users. therefore, in the interest of ensuring the dissemination of information, a significant part of the cost of depositing data in data centers in an accessible form must be provided for in the budget of the program that generates those data. only marginal costs can be tically charged to the user, and it is idle to suppose that, without additional funding from the initial datagathering program, the data centers will be able effectively to provide access to the data. the amount involved may be 5 to 20 percent of the cost of the research. experimenters should provide for these costs in the same way that they budget for publication costs. funding agencies should examine proposals in the light of these guidelines, and if an menter has failed to budget to provide appropriate access to the information that he intends to gather, he should be advised to examine the tradeoffs tween data acquisition and data access more realistically. program planners should not be allowed to avoid responsibility for the costs of data storage and retrieval. if too great a fraction of the cost of obtaining access to information is forced on users, they will simply ignore the data in the data centers, and the expected benefits of largescale programs will not be fully realized. geophysical data centers: impact of dataintensive programscopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.references 1. an assessment of the impact of worozd data centeros

fluctuations and the statistical properties of general circulation. the objectives are to improve the accuracy and range of weather forecasting and to develop a better understanding of the physical basis of climate. the program has two components: numerical modeling and experimental studies to test the validity of these models. two of the experimental programs on which data volume estimates are available are described below. there are several other experimental subprograms and related projects. gate gate was the first major international experiment of garp. its main objective was to clarify the relationship between convective activity and synopticscale systems in tropical regions sufficiently to allow accurate representation of the effects of convection in numerical prediction programs. it took place over the tropical atlantic ocean and adjacent land areas in a period of four months in 1974. gate provided a data quantity of approximately 2 x 1012 bits of level i (raw) data. of this amount, approximately 1.4 x 1012 bits were obtained by the united states (roughly half of which are retained in the national holdings .at ncc) and less than 1 x 1012 bits by nonu.s. sources. approximately 2 x 1011 bits of nationally processed and validated (level ii) data are being produced by the ten gate national processing centers (about half u.s. and half nonu.s.), for subsequent archiving in world data centers in the united states and the soviet union. approximately 1011 bits of internationally processed and validated (level ii) data are being produced by the five gate subprogram data centers (about 4 x 1010 by the convection subprogram data center in the united states and 5 x 1010 by the other sdc's) for subsequent archiving in world data centers in the united

determine potential resources of the ocean floor. u.s. tention to participate was announced in 1969. in 1972, further objectives of providing knowledge of biological processes necessary to manage living marine resources and improving mechanisms for worldwide exchange of marine data were added. there are four subprograms: environmental quality, environmental casting, seabed assessment, and living resources. each subprogram consists of several ongoing projects. the estimates below combine the data quantities for all these projects with the exception of polymode, which is listed separately. measurement category 1. all categories, 19701975 2. all categories, 19751980 polymode data quantity in bits level ii polymode is a largescale midocean dynamics experiment based on results of the polygon (u.s.s.r.) and modei (u.s.a. and u.k.) experiments. it will consist of an intensive initial field program lasting at least one year, with the jective of advancing understanding of mesocale midoceanic eddies and their role in general ocean circulation. accomplishing this objective is one step toward the development of a physically correct ocean model that will make possible oceanological forecasting and the construction of a model coupling ocean and atmospheric dynamics. the intensive data collection period is to be 19771978. 27 geophysical data centers: impact of
