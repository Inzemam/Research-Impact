professionalconferences, the technical literature, and government reports.chapter 1 briefly characterizes disaster management, placing theuse of information and communication technology in the broader human and organizational context and providing a framework for considering the range and nature of information and communicationneeds. chapter 2 presents the committeeõs vision of the potential forinformation and communication technology to improve disaster management. chapter 3 focuses on structural, organizational, and othernontechnical barriers to the acquisition, adoption, and effective useof it in disaster management. chapter 4 provides an initial outline ofthe elements of a research program aimed at strengthening itenabled capabilities for disaster management.during the development of this report, hurricane katrina struck theu.s. gulf coast. in the days following the hurricaneõs landfall, damage tothe communications infrastructure, together with a host of other communications and information concerns, was cited by decision makers andreported on in the press as among the major challenges facing those involved in response and recovery efforts. the tragic events that occurredin katrinaõs wake have, of course, served to underscore the importance ofdisaster management; they have also highlighted the role of informationtechnology in disaster management, the interplay between technical andorganizational considerations, and the contributions that research anddevelopment in these areas could make to future disaster managementactivities. however, although a number of the inputs focused on katrina,the committeeõs charge, its deliberations, and this report encompass disasters in all (natural and humanmade) forms and in all phases, frommitigation and preparedness to

consultation with the federal emergency management agency (fema), to òensure that a study is conducted on using information technology to enhance crisis preparedness,response, and consequence management of natural and manmade disasters.ó this, the final report from the national research councilõs committee on using information technology to enhance disaster management,addresses the issues listed in section 214 and provides recommendationsfor enhancing disaster management through the use of it.1 in this study,disasters are defined as natural, technological, and humaninitiated eventsthat disrupt the normal functioning of the economy and society on a largescale; information technology (it) is broadly defined as including computing and communications technology; and disaster management is definedas encompassing mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery efforts undertaken to reduce the impact of disasters.the purpose of this report is to inform federal, state, and local policymakers and public safety and emergency management professionalsabout future opportunities for the application of it to disaster manage1the committeeõs first reportñnational research council,

aimed at the diverse setof federal, state, and local agencies and other organizations (referred tohere as disaster management organizations) with responsibility for disaster management activities. several recommendations indicate what mightbe done at the federal level to foster it innovation that would enhancedisaster management efforts, but it was beyond the scope of this study torecommend exactly where responsibility for implementing these recommendations should be placed within the federal government. this reportis not intended as a comprehensive look at the complex, highly multidisciplinary topic of disaster management, nor does it explicitly addresstradeoffs between investments in it and other capabilities for disastermanagement or make recommendations about levels of funding for it (orindeed other) disaster management activities.using information technology as a point ofleverage to enhance disaster managementthe challenge of disaster management is reducing the harm disasterscause to society, the economy, and the lives of individuals and communities. that task requires disaster managers to reduce uncertainty, to calculate and compare costs and benefits, and to manage resources, often on amuch larger scale and at a much faster pace than are supported by methods and means for solving ordinary problems. it provides capabilitiesthat can help people grasp the dynamic realities of a disaster more clearlyand help them formulate better decisions more quickly. and it can helpkeep better track of the myriad details involved in all phases of disastermanagement.the committee concluded that it has asyetunrealized potential toimprove how communities, the nation, and the global community handledisasters. briefings to the committee suggested that some progress isbeing made in using it to enhance disaster management. presentationsmade at its june 2005 workshop, additional briefings to the committee,and reports on responses to recent disasters indicated, however, thatdisaster management organizations have not fully exploited many oftodayõs technology opportunities. this situation stands in contrast to theconsiderable success enjoyed by some sectors such as financial servicesand transportation in adopting new it technologies routinely andaggressively.this report describes both short and longterm opportunities to enhance responsiveness and increase resilience by applying it to disastermanagement. as in other sectors, successful use of it involves multiplefactorsñmaking smarter use of existing technologies, creating opportunities to develop and adopt new technologies, and evolving organizaimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of

effective use of it.shortterm opportunities to use italthough the committee believes that investment in it research anddevelopment (r&d) for disaster management should be guided in thelong run by a comprehensive, stakeholderdriven roadmap (see below), italso sees opportunities for shortterm investment in a number of specificareas that would yield significant benefits. the committee heard of manyinstances in which responders were able to make use of readily availabletechnologyñeither provided by their organizations or acquired personallyñthat proved valuable during a disaster. the network effects associated with many of these technologies can create a critical mass of usersthat provides a potential point of interoperability and cooperation acrossagencies. for example, ad hoc use of 802.11x wireless capabilities inlaptops carried by some first responders, peertopeer use of land mobileradio system (lmrs) radios, and use of family radio service/generalmobile radio service òwalkietalkiesó all can help to provide communications even when the communications infrastructure is damaged. suchtechnology options may already be in the hands of users but may not bedeployed in disasters because policies and procedures for their use arenot in place.other examples of òlowhanging fruitó include the following:¥use of sensors, wikis (editable web sites), blogs, and dataminingtools to capture, analyze, and share lessons learned from operational experiences;¥use of database, web, and call center technologies to establish aservice to provide information about available equipment, materiel, volunteers, and volunteer organizations;¥use of planning, scheduling, task allocation, and resource management tools to help in formulating disaster management plans and tracking execution of the plans and to ensure timely recognition of problemsand associated followup decision making; and¥use of deployable cell phone technology to rapidly establish standalone communications capabilities for use in disasters where local infrastructure is damaged.to exploit such shortterm opportunities involves identifying them,establishing policies and procedures for their use, and providing trainingto users.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.4improving disaster managementrecommendation 1:disaster management organizations shouldtake advantage of opportunities for adoption of existing technologyor adjustment of policies and procedures that would allow significant shortterm enhancement of disaster management.key itenabled capabilities and r&d to achieve themmaking good decisions and taking appropriate action during extremeevents require having access to communications, data, and computationalresources that can be used to effectively coordinate a large number ofgeographically dispersed participants and assets, to exchange a wide variety of types of information, and to evaluate many scenarios and responsesñall of which are changing dynamically.the committee identified six key areas of itenabled capability (described in box s.1 and discussed in more detail in chapter 2) in whichshorterterm development and longerterm research offer the potentialfor significant benefits:¥more robust, interoperable, and prioritysensitive communications;¥better situational awareness and a common operating picture;¥improved decision support and resource tracking and allocation;¥greater organizational agility for disaster management;¥better engagement of the public; and¥enhanced infrastructure survivability and continuity of societalfunctions.some of these capabilities address rather specialized problems thatdo not have a large commercial market, although commercial technologies will provide many of the building blocks needed to realize the capabilities. disasters are lowfrequency events outside the normal planninghorizons of most organizations, whose structure, operations, and it systems are designed to ensure daytoday efficiency rather than the resilience and scalability that disasters demand. as a result, current researchand development efforts may not necessarily focus on developing it capabilities in a manner optimized for disaster management.as detailed in chapter 4, it r&d needs and opportunities areevident across a spectrum from adoption (offtheshelf technology isavailable today) to adaptation (the technology is on the horizon andready for transfer to disaster management) to development (the technology is on the horizon and requires development for use in disaster management) to applied research (disastermanagementspecific research isrequired) to basic research (fundamental research is needed to developnew capabilities).improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations5in government mission areas such as defense and energy, a researchinfrastructure has been built over decades to ensure longterm, missiondriven scientific and engineering advancesñan effort that has included along history of investments in it. the department of defense, for example, funds a mix of shorter and longerterm r&d carried out throughthe defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) and the service laboratories as inhouse, universitybased, and contract research.these investments are aimed at building a variety of capabilities, such asthe militaryõs transition to a capability for networkcentric warfare, thatare also relevant to disaster management. to make the sort of itenabledprogress in disaster management that is envisioned in this report, thedisaster management community should also devote significant attentionand investment to a longterm research program.a number of agencies could play a role in developing and implementing such a program. the directly relevant mission of the departmentof homeland securityõs (dhsõs) science and technology directorate isòto protect the homeland by providing federal and local officials withstateoftheart technology and other resources.ó2 other agencies haverelevant capabilities in terms of it and disasterrelated research programs,modalities, constituencies, and existing connections with particular research communities, including the national science foundation (nsf),the national institute of standards and technology (nist), darpa, thenational oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa), and the research laboratories of the armed services.in a number of federal programs, multiple agencies work jointly totackle broad problems. one possible model for such an interagency program is the earthquake hazard reduction program, in which nist has alead role and the u.s. geological survey (usgs), fema, and nsf areparticipants. similarly, for disaster management, a lead agency (logicallydhs) could provide a clear single point of responsibility, coordinate activities, report on progress, and so forth; the lead agency would not beresponsible for all aspects of execution, which would fall to all of theparticipating agencies and their contractors and grantees.r&d activities also need to be well coupled to the parts of dhs thatare responsible for mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery activities to ensure that requirements are grounded in operational needsand to ensure that solutions can be transferred into federal operations andthe parts of dhs responsible for developing policy to ensure that technological and organizational questions are considered together.2see http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/editorial0530.shtm.improving

federal government should leverage thecapabilities of its agencies to carry out multidisciplinary researchin pursuit of six key itenabled capabilitiesñmore robust, interoperable, and prioritysensitive

better engagement of thepublic; and enhanced infrastructure survivability and continuityof societal functionsñand establish a coordinating mechanism forthose research activities.roadmapping as a tool to engage stakeholders andinform r&d investmentsuntil fairly recently, the technology choices facing most disaster management organizations were few, with much of the investment focusedon building specialized communications systems in close partnership withbox s.1key itenabled capabilities¥more robust, interoperable, and prioritysensitive communications. disastermanagement requires robust, prioritysensitive communications systems capableof supporting interoperation with other systems. providing these requires communication networks that are more resilient to disruption than todayõs commercialnetworks, that can last longer without utility power, that can expand capacity tomeet emergency needs, that can autonomously reconfigure themselves, that canhandle the range of communication needs and environmental conditions that arisein disasters, that have welldefined points of interoperability, and that are able todistinguish between and properly prioritize communications.¥better situational awareness and common operating picture. situationalawareness is the ability for actors in a disasterñfrom national coordinators toemergency responders to the general publicñto have information about an incident, to understand what that information means in the context of the situation andtheir goals, and to project patterns and trends. the common operating picture is ashared understanding of a situation by a group of people who need to act togetherto achieve common goals. the aim is to improve a personõs ability to do his or herjob more effectively.¥improved decision support and resource tracking and allocation. whereassituation awareness provides decision makers with information relevant to theirtasks and goals, decision support focuses on assisting them in formulating prospective actionsñhelping them understand and assess characteristics and consequences of alternative courses of action and followup on decisions, closing thefeedback loop from decision to result.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations7a small set of vendors. today, the set of technologies to choose from ismuch wider, and many more choices are possible in any particular area.but because disaster management is a systemlevel problem, there are noit òsilver bullets.ó dramatic improvements in one area of technology orprocess may have relatively little overall impact unless other interconnected pieces are modified to make use of such advances. too muchinvested in radios and not enough in logistics might mean, for instance,that one can call for help but cannot get it.a clear vision of enduser goals, a detailed understanding of the individual pieces of the problem and their interrelationships, a detailed understanding of the required technologies, and defined paths for progresswould help greatly to inform investment decisions. these are among theelements of a roadmapñan agreedon, coordinated vision that can helporganizations to plan development and investment strategies that canbring technologies together at the right time. roadmaps are used in anumber of sectors to accomplish this sort of alignment and cooperation.a number of stakeholders, including first responders, public safety¥greater organizational agility for disaster management. the use of it hasenabled and driven changes to organizational structures and processes (e.g., moredistributed decision making). agility is at a premium in disasters because no onetype of organization or group of organizations is always best suited for the varietyof problems that arise. related issues with significant it implications include building rapport among people who do not share a history of cooperation and morequickly integrating the operations of multiple organizations.¥better engagement of the public by (1) supplying information and (2) making use of information and resources that members of the public can supply. although it is used today to alert and inform the public before, during, and after adisaster, more use could be made of new communications modalities, and information could be better tailored and targeted to the needs of particular populations.more attention should be paid to the information and resources held by the publicbecause members of the public collectively have a richer view of a disaster situation, may possess increasingly sophisticated technology to capture and communicate information, and are an important source of volunteers, supplies, and equipment. one important factor is how to engage the entire population, given theexistence of groups with cultural and language differences and other specialneeds.¥enhanced infrastructure survivability and continuity of societal functions.large disasters upset physical infrastructure, such as the electric grid, transportation, and health careñas well as it systems. it infrastructures themselves need tobe more resilient; it can also improve the survivability and speed the recovery ofother infrastructure by providing better information about the status of systems andadvance warning of impending failures. finally, it can facilitate the continuity ofdisrupted societal functions by providing new tools for reconnecting families,friends, organizations, and communities.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.8improving disaster managementand emergency management agencies, government officials, medical providers, volunteer organizations, infrastructure and transportation systemowners, vendors, it researchers, and disaster researchers, have importantperspectives on how to build on existing organizations and technologywhere possible and how to drive the creation of new, costeffective technologies and organizational structures where needed. however, an institutional home is needed to launch and sustain such activity.recommendation 3:the federal government should develop andregularly update an it r&d roadmap for disaster management withthe involvement of a full range of stakeholders. improving acquisition and adoption ofinformation technologyadoption of it for disaster management is challenging for a numberof reasons, including the following (which are discussed in more detail inchapter 3):¥disaster management organizations often lack the resources to acquire valuable capabilities.¥the development and deployment of many promising technologies are risky and costly given the limited opportunities presented bycommercial markets for these technologies.¥in most agencies with disaster management responsibilities, thereis no person or unit specifically charged with tracking it, identifyingpromising technologies, integrating them into operations, and interactingwith it vendors to make sure needs are addressed.¥decisions regarding it tend to be made independently by localorganizations that must work together in disasters.¥disaster management is concerned with environments that are intrinsically uncertain and unstable.¥important sources of funds are typically only available once a disaster has been declared and also must be spent in a short time window.diversified acquisition strategy and attention to design issuesdisaster management has traditionally relied heavily on speciallybuilt technology and on a traditional òwaterfalló acquisition model inwhich a full set of specifications is developed and a vendor is selected tobuild a system in compliance with the specifications. in the commercialworld and in sectors such as defense, there is growing acceptance of aricher, more diversified acquisition strategy that employs a mix of tradiimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations9tional (purposebuilt) systems, adoption and adaptation of commercialofftheshelf (cots) technology and services, and use of open sourcesoftware, open standards, and communitydriven development approaches. such a strategy for disaster management should draw on thestrengths of the traditional vendor community yet also foster bottomupdevelopment as a complement to traditional acquisition practices andmore formal topdown development; tap the nationõs technology base;and also encourage the òcandoó spirit of commercial developers, professionals, and volunteers involved in disaster management.as mentioned above, cots technology alone is unlikely to deliver allof the desired capabilities. but it is important in two waysñ(1) adoptionand adaptation of readily available technologies offer a path for buildingup disaster management capabilities in the short term, and (2) the interoperability often characteristic of cots technologies makes them usefulas building blocks for disaster management systems.recommendation 4:federal, state, and local agencies should embrace a diversified acquisition strategy that includes increased useof commercial information technology and greater use of opensource software and open standards development as a complementto more traditional acquisition approaches.reliance on turnkey systems has meant that disaster managementorganizations have paid less attention to the underlying design issuesthat ultimately affect the functionality of their it systems. often technologies have been acquired as standalone products with little considerationfor how they integrate with other technologies already in use, even withinthe same agency. however, with networking becoming increasingly pervasive, careful attention should be given to how each particular it systemfits into the broader context of interconnected systems. offtheshelf technology such as desktop computers or network routers can provide basicbuilding blocks, and some elements of design are also well establishedsuch as the internet protocol standard for packet networks, but a domainspecific architecture understood and owned by the organization is alsoneeded. to accomplish this, organizations have to develop the necessarytechnical and technology management capabilities.recommendation 5:disaster management organizations shouldwork closely with technology providers to define, shape, and integrate new technologies as a coherent part of their overall it system.the committee believes that more can be done to embrace provenapproaches for it acquisition. best practices for acquisition include animproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.10improving disaster managementemphasis on iterative development, increased opportunities to test andevaluate technology in practice together with realistic concepts of operations, and design and evaluation processes that allow for strong couplingamong practitioners, researchers, and industry.the committee also identified four design principles (discussed inmore detail in chapter 3) that have particular importance for disastermanagement systems:¥build emergency management systems for effective scaling fromroutine to disaster operation;¥exploit redundancy and diversity to achieve resilience;¥design systems with flexibility, composability, and interoperabilityas core guiding principles; and¥distinguish between the user interface and the underlying technologies used to deliver a capability.training and practice through routine use of itunless experience is gained through routine use or regular training,the full benefits of investment in it systems are unlikely to be realized.training, drills, and exercises all play an important role in the introduction of new technologies into organizational practice. moreover, it isthrough routine use that the competence and confidence required to successfully use a technological capability, especially in the highstress situation of disasters, are best developed. however, training large numbers ofpeople to deal with infrequent events poses logistical challenges and isalso costly.recommendation 6:in the design, acquisition, and operation of itsystems, disaster management organizations should emphasize theincorporation of disaster response capabilities into the systems thatsupport routine operations. measurement and assessment to enhance effectivenessas the saying goes, one can only manage what one can measure.because the resources available for disaster management are limited, decision making always involves tradeoffs. weighing the benefits from particular it investments against the returns on other sorts of investment ischallenging. although having measures of effectiveness is necessary tomaking such assessments, few applicable metrics are currently available.above all, acquisition of it and associated organizational changesimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations11should be driven by a focus on improving the effectiveness of those whoseactions are integral to effective disaster management. the emphasisshould be on measuring the resulting net effectiveness of disaster management activities, not the performance of the it per se. for example,rather than focusing on the performance of particular systems (e.g., afirefighter radio system has 90 percent coverage), it is important to try togauge net effectiveness (e.g., better communications coverage allows firefighters to better coordinate their response, improving capabilities forfighting forest fires by 20 percent). the development of such metrics is anarea for further research.recommendation 7:disaster management organizations shouldemploy metrics to inform costbenefit decisions for investment init for disaster management and should make enhanced enduserperformance a primary objective of disaster management acquisition programs.independent mechanisms for assessment, such as the transportationsafety board, the u.s. chemical safety and hazard investigation board,and the nasa aviation safety reporting system, have proven useful intheir respective domains. a critical requirement of these organizations istheir independence from the agencies that have operational responsibilities. it may be advantageous to employ several organizations rather thana single national one, with each one focusing on a particular type ofdisaster or the range of disasters typical in a particular region. it is alsoimportant for assessments to be founded on multiple areas of expertise,including technical, social, and organizational dimensions. obviously, theeffectiveness of it use is just one facet of an assessment of the overalleffectiveness of disaster management activities for any particular incident, albeit an important one.recommendation 8: disaster management organizations shouldmake use of independent mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of disaster management operations, including the use of it,and for disseminating lessons learned and best practices.systematic collection of datait is well understood as a result of endeavors in many areas (e.g.,aircraft accident investigations) that making significant improvementsdepends on putting in place processes that allow learning from experience. it can play a critical role in enhancing the science of disaster manimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.12improving disaster managementagement by helping to support continuous improvement. collecting adequate and trustworthy data is essential for the feedback necessary todrive improvements in disaster management. doing so requires better documentation of disasters and the responses to them, including the role of supporting technology. the widespread introduction of it into disaster management provides opportunities for largescale, automated, comprehensive collection of data aboutoperations, decision making, and situational knowledge throughout adisaster. this information can be processed after the fact to improve understanding of the process of disaster management. it can also help tomake these lessons learned available in real time, putting them into thehands of decision makers when they are most needed.accomplishing this goal requires enhanced technical capabilities tocapture data during the course of a disaster. in some cases, it may benecessary to find ways to anonymize data so that accurate statistics can begathered without the difficulty of dealing with potential liability issues.policy changes (analogous to the adoption of good samaritan laws3) mayalso be needed to ensure that individuals involved in a disaster responsecan be protected from liability (e.g., amendments to the health insuranceportability and accountability act [hipaa] may be needed). legislationmay also be needed to ensure that intellectual property, privacy, liability,and other concerns of information providers are addressed if they arerequired to share such data for research purposes.coupling research and practiceeffective development, use, and deployment of it depend on a solidunderstanding of context and user needs. moreover, the introduction ofnew it often presents opportunities for new organizational approaches,and these opportunities should be considered in reorganization efforts.similarly, successful technology development requires consideration oforganizational context.this issue of codevelopment of technology and organizational practice seems especially important at present. in the wake of hurricanekatrina, a number of organizational structures, policies, and proceduresare being examined. also, a number of relevant technologies have reacheda sufficient level of maturity to allow innovative organizational approaches to disaster management.the interdependence of technology and practice suggests that developing a cadre of people with expertise in both disaster management and3good samaritan laws shield people from liability in emergency circumstances providedthat they have acted in a reasonable manner.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations13it is likely to yield significant payoffs. such a cadre of people is likely tobe more astute at translating user requirements to technical needs. onebasic need, of course, is to train a group of first responders and othersresponsible for disaster management in it skills that go beyond those of ageneral user and to train a group of it workers (e.g., database and systemadministrators and application builders) to have domain expertise in disaster management. deeper expertise spanning both domains could befostered through a number of mechanisms, including the following:¥a combination of fellowships, shorterterm visits to research centers, and other training and educational activities that help technologyexperts and other practitioners to stay abreast of the latest developmentsin both practice and technology;¥field tests and field work conducted by it researchers workingwith disaster management practitioners; and¥combined disaster managementit expert teams that jointly analyze the performance of processes and systems after a disaster.recommendation 9:disaster management organizations shouldsupport the development of a cadre of people with expertise inboth disaster management and it.especially in light of the significant nontechnical factors affectingadoption of it for disaster management, it is critical to establish mechanisms that ensure that researchers are exposed to real problems and thatpractitioners are exposed to new technology opportunities. because mostpractitioners are distributed across local agencies, forging such ties islikely to be harder in disaster management than in sectors like defense,but it is no less important.collaborative research centers could bring together experts from diverse domains in a neutral environment conducive to collaboration. suchcenters could (1) develop a shared understanding of the challenges in allphases of disaster management from both a technological and an organizational perspective, (2) evaluate the application of technology advancesto disaster management practice, (3) develop a culture and processes fortransitioning knowledge and technology to the operational communitieson a sustained basis, (4) build human capital at the intersection of it anddisaster management, (5) serve as repositories for data and for lessonslearned from past disasters and disaster management efforts, and (6) provide forwardlooking analysis to inform the development of technologycapabilities, associated organizational processes, and roadmap development. a number of academic centers exist that offer a capacity for at leastsome of these efforts.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.14improving disaster managementpractitioners in multiple disciplines could contribute to such centers,including scientists, engineers, and hazard and disaster researchers, andcenters should include partnerships with federal, state, and local disastermanagement agencies. indeed, it is critical that experienced and capableofficials and operational elements of disaster management organizationsbe deeply involved in the work of these centers. one approach for engaging these groups would be to provide incremental funds to agencies specifically for working with researchers and developing nextgenerationtechnologies. having multiple centers (rather than a single entity) alsohelps to ensure healthy intellectual competition, crossfertilization ofideas, specialization in specific types of disasters and specific technologycapabilities, and attention to the comprehensive needs of particular geographical areas.research centers could also act as a resource for agencies seeking toimplement a diversified acquisition strategy and incorporate the latestbest practices and a mechanism for disaster managers and responders toshare experiences and communicate requirements to guide further technology developments.recommendation 10:the federal government should sustain (anddevelop as needed) a network of research centers where it researchers, hazard and disaster researchers, and disaster management practitioners can collaborate to study and evaluate the use of it fordisaster management from both a technological and an organizational perspective, to transition knowledge and technology to thosewho practice disaster management, to build human capital at theintersection of it and disaster management, and to develop futureit capabilities.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation,

on using information technology to enhance disastermanagement, which was established in response to a congressionalrequest for a study to examine the use of information technology òtoenhance crisis preparedness, response, and consequence management ofnatural and manmade disastersó (see box p.1 in the preface).drawing on a june 2005 workshop (see the agenda in appendix c)and a series of briefings and site visits (listed in appendix d), as well asthe experience and expertise represented on the committee itself (outlined in appendix e), the committee sought to identify promising applications of information and communication technology (hereafter referredto as it) to disaster management, promising areas of research for improving the effectiveness of it, and mechanisms that would enhance research,development, and deployment efforts. the resulting report is intended toinform federal, state, and local policy makers and public safety and emergency management professionals about future opportunities for the application of it to disaster management. it is not intended as a comprehensive look at the complex, highly multidisciplinary topic of disastermanagement. nor do the committeeõs findings and recommendations explicitly address tradeoffs between investments in information technologyand other capabilities for disaster management or offer advice about levels of funding for it or other disaster management activities.this chapter provides a brief overview of challenges confronted indisaster management, focusing particularly on the use and role of it;improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.16improving disaster managementpresents several different ways of thinking about information and communication needs in disasters, which together provide a framework forunderstanding the various roles that it plays in disaster management;and places the issue of it use into the broader social context of disastersand disaster management.disasters, disaster management, andinformation technologydisasters are events that disrupt the normal functioning of theeconomy and society on a large scale (for more on terminology, see box1.1). natural, technological, and willful (terrorist initiated) sources of disasters all cause dramatic losses of life and property.box 1.1terminology used in disaster managementa variety of terms are used in the fields of emergency and disaster management. over time, a fairly standard set of definitions has emerged, as reflected in aseries of reports from the national research council and other groups. emergencies, disasters, and catastrophes, for example, are distinct events with importantdifferentiating characteristics.1 this report does not specifically consider òemergenciesóña term that connotes òeverydayó events that can be handled within thenormal operational limits of public safety agenciesñnor does it distinguish between disasters and largerscale events that might be called catastrophes, eventhough it is likely that the value of it capabilities increases as the complexity andscale of communication problems become greater. throughout this report, the termòdisasteró can be read as òdisaster and catastrophe.óthis report uses the following set of definitions, adapted in part from facinghazards and disasters: understanding human dimensions: 2¥disasters are nonroutine events in societies, regions, or communities thatinvolve conjunctions of physical conditions with social definitions of human harmand social disruption. the term òdisasteró has significant policy implications; forexample, a declaration of an event as a disaster is needed before certain resources are made available.¥hazards are a source of potential or actual harm. hazards may be natural,technological, or willful in origin. examples of natural hazards include floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, and so on. technological hazards include industrial accidents and other humanmade sources of potential harm. bhopal and chernobyl are examples. terrorist attacks such as those on september11, 2001, and the bombing in oklahoma city are examples of willful hazards.¥incident (or event) is the specific occurrence of a disaster. a single disasterincident may lead to additional incidents. for instance, an earthquake may lead toa tsunami and the tsunami may lead further to flooding. the term òincidentó alsoimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.introduction and context17has important bureaucratic meaning (e.g., incident period) that determines, forinstance, who qualifies for financial assistance.¥risk is a function of the likelihood (i.e., probability) of a specific event occurring and the potential consequences of harm should it in fact occur.¥hazard vulnerability is the potential for physical harm and social disruptionto societies and their larger subsystems associated with hazards and disasters.there are two general types of vulnerability: physical vulnerability and social vulnerability. physical vulnerability represents threats to physical structures and infrastructures, the natural environment, and related economic losses. social vulnerability represents threats to the wellbeing of human populations and relatedeconomic losses.¥hazard mitigation is an ongoing effort to reduce the physical and socialimpact of future disasters. it includes interventions made in advance of disasters toprevent or reduce the impact. there are two major types of hazard mitigation:structural mitigation involves designing, constructing, maintaining, and renovatingphysical structures and infrastructures to resist the physical forces of disaster impacts. nonstructural mitigation involves efforts to decrease the exposure of humanpopulations, physical structures, and infrastructures to hazardous conditions.¥disaster preparedness includes actions taken in advance of disasters todeal with anticipated problems of disaster response and recovery. actions includetraining and exercises to improve readiness; development and refinement of response and recovery plans; development, deployment, testing, and maintenanceof systems used for disaster management; and public education and informationprograms for individuals, households, firms, and public agencies.¥disaster response provides for the immediate protection of life and property, reestablishing control and minimizing the effects of a disaster. it encompassesthe issuance and dissemination of predictions and warnings; planning and preparation immediately before an event (such as preparations following a hurricanewarning); evacuation and other forms of protective action; mobilization and organization of emergency personnel, volunteers, and material resources; search andrescue; care of casualties and survivors; damage and needs assessment; damagecontrol and restoration of public services; and maintenance of the political andlegal system.¥disaster recovery encompasses both shortterm activity intended to returnvital physical and social systems to operation and longerterm activities designedto restore these systems to their predisaster state. the concept of recovery encompasses both objective measures, such as reconstruction and assistance efforts, and the subjective experiences of disaster victims and processes of psychological and social recovery.1e.l. quarantelli, òemergencies, disasters and catastrophes are different phenomena,ódisaster research center, university of delaware, 2000; available at

origins, their effectspropagate and interact in ways that intensify the complexities and uncertainties of dealing with them effectively. one major result is that disastersmust be responded to in an environment that can be overwhelming, unfamiliar, and disorienting. these challenges are quite familiar to experienced emergency managers and first responders, as manifest in a homespun sign found in many u.s. emergency operations centers (figure 1.1a).this sign stands in marked contrast to a sign described by a reviewer ofthis report in draft form that lists what emergency managers aspire toñand often achieve despite the many obstaclesñin a disaster (figure 1.1b).disaster management is a multifaceted process aimed at minimizingthe social and physical impact of these largescale events. the difficultnature of disaster management is well illustrated by the catastrophicincident annex to the national response plan, which lists some of thepotential problems faced in the aftermath of a disaster (box 1.2). disasterfigure 1.1 wording on two signs displayed in emergency operations centersillustrating (a) challenges to decision making and (b) basic goals. sources:(a) art botterell,

critical systems to functionality and meet basic socialneeds. examples of sustained response include restoration of sewers,water, and communications. recovery seeks to minimize cascading impacts and facilitate longterm restoration to the preevent situation.widespread efforts at managing disasters in a comprehensive fashionare a relatively modern phenomenon. disaster management in the unitedstates has historically been and remains a highly localized task that depends largely on local resources. still, regional, state, and national effortshave grown out of the need to meet the increasing scale of disasters andthe associated costs of managing them. (box 1.3 identifies major milestones in the evolution of federal disaster management.)much progress has been made over the years in reducing the loss oflife. even loss of property from disasters is less than it might otherwisehave been where various mitigation and preparedness strategies havebeen adopted and aggressive response and recovery efforts undertaken.2yet, losses continue to increase.3 many factors have contributed to growing losses despite considerable progress in our understanding of themand in the practice of disaster management.it has been a major contributor to the progress that has been made.4indeed, some of these applications have become so commonplace that it iseasy to forget the improvements made over recent decades. one familiar2see, for example, board on natural

disaster managementexample is application of it to weather forecasting that has resulted inmore accurate and timely warnings of hurricanes and floods.5 it has thepotential for even greater impact on enhancing disaster management practice across all of its phasesñmitigation, preparedness, response, and recoveryñprovided it is used consistent with the knowledge of hazards,disasters, and disaster management practices that has been gained fromthe diverse range of disciplines that contribute to that knowledge base.6box 1.4 provides a sampling of uses and examples of particular technologies that illustrate the myriad ways in which it is an integral part ofdisaster management today.responding to disasters involves such information and communicationintensive activities as marshaling available resources and materiel,mobilizing and organizing sufficient skilled personnel, deploying themwith those resources to where they are needed, and finally coordinatingtheir actions. specific tasks include establishing connectivity with potential resource providers, authorizing the use of resources and coordinatingtheir use into something akin to a supply chain, integrating informationfrom diverse (including ad hoc) sources, reducing the volume of data torelevant information for recipients, directing ongoing operations basedon an overall awareness of the situation, adjusting and altering priorplans and commitments based on the evolving situation, and supportingcollaboration and distributed decision making. the mitigation process issimilarly complex and can involve many situation and locationspecificdetails, and it relies heavily on tools such as predictive models of theimpacts of particular disasters. it is thus not surprising that it has becomea critical tool for facilitating the communications and informationprocessing activities in managing disasters.the larger human and organizational context of disaster management was the subject of a recent national research council study. facinghazards and disasters: understanding human dimensions describes researchundertaken during the past three decades by social scientists on hazardsand disasters and recommends a continuing research agenda.7 the reportobserves that the management of disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery has been aided by improvements in information5national

an effective organizational and public response to disasters.8indeed, an important lesson from past disasters is that applying it ina vacuum (i.e., without considering the broader organizational and socialcontext) may not only be ineffective but detrimental by, among otherthings, creating the perception that technology will solve all problems.9put another way, there is no it òbandaidó that will by itself overcomeunderlying organizational problems or problems rooted in systemic process, procedural, and policy issues that have never been reconciled.10 norcan it alone address societal decisions such as settlement and land usepatterns, construction standards and practices, and issues of social justiceand equity. all of these factors and many others may increase vulnerability to hazards of large segments of the population and property. it does,however, provide useful capabilities for tackling many of these challenges.this experience is consistent with what is understood about the rolethat it has played in productivity and quality advances in other sectors,ranging from defense to banking and finance. the empirical evidenceshows, for example, that it is not simply a tool for automating existingprocesses and that its real impact is as an enabler of organizationalchanges.11 it is the complementary investment in decentralized decisionmaking systems, training, and business processes along with technologythat allows organizational efficiency improvements.there are a number of barriers to the adoption and use of it in disaster management, growing out of the unique character of the institutionsresponsible, the organizational structure of the community as a whole,their need to focus on daytoday operational missions, and their need toactively cooperate only under the most trying circumstances. limitedbudgets, lack of expertise and other resources, demographic differences8ibid., p. 68.9e.l. quarantelli, òproblematical aspects of the information/communication

humantohuman communicationsñstarting with the first use ofradios in coordinating disaster responses, voice communication over radio hasbeen the primary role for it in managing disasters. indeed, by 1912 radio wasrecognized as critical to disaster response with the enactment of a law, in response to the titanic disaster on april 14 of that year, which required all ships tohave radios with two operators and auxiliary power and licensed transmitters.1¥remote sensingñnetworks of sensors are used in many ways, such asproviding data for weather prediction and earthquake detection, to mitigate theimpact of and to prepare for many natural disasters. sensors are also extensivelyused to prevent or control humanmade disasters. doppler radar is used to identifyand track hurricanes, tornados, and other weather phenomena. networks of earthand structure motion detectors provide information about the severity and natureof earthquakes. satellite imagery is used to map and plan operations in majorwildland fires. tsunami detectors provide advanced warning of the location andnature of tsunamis. interferometric synthetic aperture radar (ifsar), which uses anaircraftmounted sensor to measure surface elevation, produces topographic imagery. light detection and ranging (lidar) technology can measure the speed,distance, rotation, and chemical composition of a remote target, where the targetcan be either a clearly defined object, such as a building, or a diffuse object, suchas a cloud. other optical methods can also be used to remotely measure chemicalcomposition of air masses to track toxic materials.¥warning and alertingñsirens systems have been used for over 100 yearsas a means to alert as many people as possible as quickly as possible.2 onefamiliar itbased warning system is the emergency alert system (eas) established by the federal communications commission (fcc) in november 1994;eas replaced the emergency broadcast system (ebs) as a tool to warn the public(e.g., urban versus rural), and the press of routine responsibilities alsorepresent major constraints.however, as was illustrated in testimony to the committee and inafteraction reports of disaster responses, inventiveness, improvisation,and ingenuity have partially compensated for some of these shortcomings. indeed, the often tacit knowledge of practitioners of disaster management about the realities of what works must also be incorporated ifstrategies for improving the use of it in disaster management are to havemaximum effect. the committee was mindful of this òcandoó spirit as itexamined the needs and opportunities for using it and ways of overcoming obstacles to its successful deployment and use.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness,

communication hubs have enabled media to reportfrom disasters. the public is also able to participate in new ways through the useof mobile phones, text messaging, and the internet. while the technical capabilityfor public participation in disaster reporting continues to grow, it has gone largelyunrealized, even though recent disasters have shown that these alternative communication techniques are more robust than previously thought.¥modeling and simulationñincreasingly sophisticated models are being created of weather, storm surge, earthquake ground motion and shake intensity, toxicplume modeling, hazard prediction, and loss analysis. culturally dependent models of population response would also be important for managing evacuations andother aspects of disaster management.1university

reflecting the multiple purposes for informationand communication and the different activities and information and communications requirements that occur at different times and locations withrespect to a disaster.12 communications and information processing requirements in a disaster are very heterogeneous, varying according tocontext, use, time, latency, distance, and bandwidth. there are also many12board on natural disasters, national research council, reducing disaster losses throughbetter information, national academy press, washington, d.c., 1999.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.26improving disaster managementtypes of information that can be communicated from many informationsources. indeed, the types of information available continue to grow withongoing advances in it. there is also a broad range of information actorsand organizations involved in managing disasters; their ability to makeappropriate decisions and function effectively can be greatly enhanced byit and may depend on it for dealing with increasingly complex situations.given the heterogeneity of the information, the dynamics of the situation, and the diversity of actors, it is not surprising that there are anumber of tensions that arise between more centralized, topdown, andplanned disaster management activities and more decentralized, bottomup, and ad hoc activities. for example, consider the following:¥the needs of òofficialó first responders versus those of emergentgroups of people,¥commandandcontrol decision making versus distributed decision making,¥the needs of first responders in the field versus the needs of higherlevel decision makers, and¥the need for security and privacy protection versus the benefits ofbroadened access to information.there are also inherent tensions between local governments andamong federal, state, and local levels of government.in each of these cases, the design and deployment of an it systemcan make the tensions more acute and more visible. moreover, it cannotbe used to paper over organizational problemsñbut its appropriate usemay enable disaster managers to successfully accommodate a wider spectrum of disaster management activities, and do so more effectively andefficiently.examples of the kinds of informationuseful in disaster managementthe first applications of it to disasters were in the form of voicecommunications. advances since then have led to many additional formsof information that have been included in disaster management practicesto varying degrees, including text, geospatial data, video, sensor data,and collections of these and other types of data in databases or otherelectronic forms.the number of available information sources has expanded considerably in recent years to include surveillance cameras; ground, air, andsatellite sensors; telemetry from assets and personnel; unmanned vehicles;and eye witnesses with more technology. some of these data sources haveimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.introduction and context27been well integrated into disaster planning. other sources could improvesituation awareness with efforts at better integration. the national research council study reducing disaster losses through better informationcatalogs a number of potential information sources (base data, scientificdata, engineering data, economic data, environmental data, response data)and major types of information held and being gathered by federal agencies (e.g., base cartographic, landuse, seismic, hazardous site, demographic, aircraft route, river flow, and meteorological information).13 although some of these data sources are currently being used by disasterresearchers for vulnerability assessment,14 they are often inaccessible,unused, out of date, unusable, or inadequate for disaster managers, especially during response.15further advances in sensor technology (both prepositioned and postincident deployable) are likely to lead to opportunities for further improvements in both the volume and quality of data available. a numberof factors affect data qualityñcompleteness, timeliness, accuracy, andconsistencyñand advances should target all of them.it needs and the incident time linein thinking about the use of it in a disaster it is useful to think of anincident time line consisting of three segments: preincident, transincident,and postincident. in fact, the value of considering disasters and disastermanagement chronologically is unquestionable and taken for granted.16disaster management can be viewed as roughly divided into three parts:(1) reducing exposure to and preparations for a hazard under routine,preincident circumstance; (2) preparations and actions immediately priorto and during an event; and (3) dealing with the consequences once it hasoccurred. thinking in terms of time is also essential for understanding thedifferent requirements for disaster management depending on the type ofdisaster. it plays important roles in each time segment, and the committee considered the potential for increasing effectiveness in each one.13board on natural disasters, national research council,

disaster managementexamples of the kinds of datacommunicated in the response to a disasterone important kind of data communicated in a disaster is directivesand authorizations for inter and intraagency coordination. these arelargely synchronous exchanges about where to go, where to meet, andreporting status. they can generally be accomplished through lowbandwidth mechanisms such as voice and text (e.g., email, text messaging)and can be transmitted using both realtime media (voice or chat) andnearrealtime media (such as email). coordination tasks result in interdependencies where agency a cannot proceed with a task without authorization from or the arrival of agency bñwaits that can introducesignificant delays in response activities if robust communications are notavailable.another important kind of data is requests for distributed decisionmaking, especially logistics and planning. the content of these exchangesis akin to those that arise in dynamically creating a supply chain or abusiness enterprise where requests are tracked and processed. the exchanges may be more asynchronous where text and other files are sentand the time for a response is less immediate. bandwidth requirementsmay generally be modest and traffic levels relatively low, but large filesmay need to be shared and databases kept synchronized.data are also needed to inform decision making at all levels andto help form a common operational picture. relevant data include thefollowing:¥human observations from direct response activities. these are the reports from observers in the field, such as from local emergency operationscenters, country transportation workers, prepositioned trained observers, or other responders. the exchanges are largely onedirectional, fromthe observer to a commander. voice (e.g., cell and satellite phones) andtext are both useful.¥geographic information system (gis)oriented data. gis informationflows both to and from the field, with maps and projections such as flooding pushed to responders or tracking of personnel and assets collected bycommanders. gis information is typically in the form of highresolutionmaps. if appropriate map sets have not been prepositioned, largeamounts of data may need to be transmitted; otherwise communicationswill generally take the form of updates and overlays to base maps.¥visualoriented data. overhead imagery, satellite photos (before andafter), and pictures and video of the disaster from other sources such asthe public or other responding agencies can be extremely valuable. thesedata are inherently highbandwidth and often need to be shared amongimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all

not established. consider, for example, that a highresolution overhead image of a coastline would help urban searchandrescue units prioritize searches and allow transportation and law enforcement officials to determine avenues of access for supplies, controllingaccess, and so on.¥logistical information. information about the location and status ofresources provides an important part of the common operational picture.relevant data include databases and schedules describing where resources are, what and who has been dispatched to which affected areas,and so on; and what resources are needed by whom, where, and when,and the specific capabilities and limitations of those resources.17¥sensor data. information about the status of built infrastructure andenvironmental factors provided

transmitted. improving the effectiveness ofdata sources may include improving the usefulness of and access to thedata. valuable data sources exist for all phases of disaster management.some sources of data for response include the following:¥data being òpushedó from the field. during response, some sources ofvaluable data include data mapping damage, locations of responders andother resources, information on the status of response activities, and sensor data. highfidelity (and thus highbandwidth) data are required forsome applications. for example, pictures or video of damage to a bridgecould be transmitted to offsite experts for structural assessment.¥data being òpulledó from and òpushedó into the field. a few examplesof data respondersõ requests or data sent to them include

internet offers the prospect of identifyingand creating information resources dynamically from a wide variety ofofficial and nonofficial sources.tactical versus strategic operationstactical operations focus on the response operations in the affectedarea. they may involve stabilizing the situation sufficiently to carry outthose operations. (in the case of a terrorist incident, this could involvecapture or neutralization of the threat as well as responding to it.) decisions are often immediate, based on direct observation and a prioriknowledge. any available information useful for gaining a broader understanding of the situation to aid in the decisionmaking process mayhelp answer questions critical to tactical operations such as, what resources are nearby that i can use? how extensive is this problem? canneighboring resources/units be directed my way? when can i expecthelp to get here? a secondary role of tactical operations is as generalinformation gatherers for the strategic operations.strategic operations, by contrast, are essentially òenterpriseó decisions and may span weeks to months. information flow for strategic operations is highly computercentric and more akin to the flow of information in a supply chain management system.a particular challengeñand one where it can play an importantroleñin disasters is connecting tactical operations and strategic operations. the physical distance between the tactical and strategic decisionmakers, as well as the differing time spans for decisions, poses additionalchallenges for cooperative work and information sharing. another arearequiring further research is in understanding what the roles should befor strategic and tactical operations and how it should be structured inorder to properly support those roles.a framework for considering use of informationtechnology in the broader social contextas suggested above, both successes and failures in disaster management depend on the effectiveness and resilience of human as well astechnological systems. as a result, broad statements about it failuresduring disaster, although often true, can be a major source of confusionabout the complex sources of disaster management failures. a fourlayeròstackó model developed by the committee illustrates the range of issuesimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.introduction and context31that are sometimes lumped under the rubric of òcommunication,óòinteroperability,ó and òinformation technologyó issues. the model includes the following elements:1.organizational and social context comprises the goals, metrics, priorities, and beliefs of each organization involved, as well as those ofòmetaorganizationsó such as an incident command structure or an emergency operations center that involves multiple organizations. it is concerned with the purpose, content, and partners in communication. thesocial side goes beyond the logical layer that facilitates transmitting content. it includes the cultural and organizational constraints and workarounds to organizational barriers, such as informal social networks between trusted friends in different organizations. one source ofòcommunicationó problems at this level can be simple misalignment between the goals and priorities of different organizational elements; forexample, at a potential terrorism site there might be a òdisconnectó between organizations focused on criminal investigation and others concerned chiefly with rescue or restoration of services.2.human behavioral context includes the many variables of individualhuman performance, including skill sets, training, experience, health,personal stress, and other personal factors. despite efforts at standardization, human beings inevitably bring a degree of variability into theexecution of procedure and the pursuit of organizational goals and values. this is not necessarily a bad thing; indeed human originality andadaptability are often critical to meeting unforeseen challenges. but theycan insert an only partly controlled variable into the performanceof carefully planned processes and can give rise to problems that aresometimes mischaracterized as technologyrelated communicationsproblems, especially under conditions of high stress or uncertainty typical in disasters.3.procedural and policy framework refers to predictable patterns ofbehavior. sometimes these are formalized and documented, but oftenthey are unwritten and even unconscious artifacts of an organizational ordisciplinary culture. procedures are often eventdriven, that is, expressedin the form òwhen x happens, do y.ó a great deal of implicit knowledgeabout the immediate system and its environment is encoded in suchprocedures. as a result, they can be confounded by the profound changesin context that may accompany a disaster. for example, an emergencycommunications plan can be disrupted by loss of, or interference with,expected technical channels. without an effective way to devise and transition to an alternate plan, such disruptions can lead to perceived majorfailures of communication, even when significant technical capabilityremains.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.32improving disaster management4.technology includes the bulk of what is frequently understood inthe terms òcommunications,ó òinteroperability,ó and òinformation technology.ó technology is the medium through which communications andinfrastructure needs are met, and can be thought of as the physical layerof communications. it includes all of the capital infrastructure investmentfor communications and information technology. although technical failures are by no means uncommon, they can frequently be circumventedusing alternate technologies, provided the procedures, skills, and organizational will remain to implement such expedients.this conceptual model presents a number of useful insights. first,problems (and the perceptions of problems) tend to propagate downward(from 1 to 4) through the stack, so that various nontechnical issues canend up being framed as technology failures. for example, police andfirefighters at a traffic accident might have subtly different organizationalpriorities. the firefighters might be focused on the wellbeing of victimsat the scene, while the police might be tasked with reestablishing unhampered traffic flow for the larger community. this organizational difference might lead to personal and procedural conflicts that ultimately mightbe (mistakenly) characterized as a òcommunication problemó and then(also mistakenly) interpreted as a failure of òinteroperability,ó which isfrequently assumed to be a technical issue.second, change tends to propagate upward (from 4 to 1) through thestack. effective use of new technologies requires and enables new procedures, which in turn require new skills and create new challenges, towhich organizations ultimately must adapt. for example, in many largeorganizations, computerbased wordprocessing software was first introduced in a òwordprocessing pooló office, by analogy to previous typingand dictation pools. over time the opportunities that provided for fasterand more flexible service moved the new technology out to secretarialdesks in the operating departments, and eventually onto the desktops ofcommanders and executives. the wordprocessing pool, and in somecases the secretary as well, faded into organizational history.third, many interoperability and datasharing challenges are not fully oreven mostly technical in nature. indeed, as noted in the report summarizing a workshop convened as part of this project, better òhuman organization, willingness to cooperate, and a willingness of government at higherlevels to listen to those at local levels who really do the work and who arethe actual responders are all critical factors in making better use of information technology for disaster management.ó19 as a result, many inter19see national research council, summary of a workshop on using information technologyto enhance disaster management, the

no single prescription or discipline can provideall the answers.1 indeed, disaster researchers have frequently expressedconcerns that technology not be viewed as a panacea.2 the committeeshares the view that enhancing disaster management requires attention to1see, for example, national research council, a safer future: reducing the impacts ofnatural disasters, national academy press, washington,

technologies.3nonetheless, it represents an important point of leverage for enhancing disaster management.4 briefings to the committee suggested thatprogress continues to be made toward ever more effective use of information technology to enhance disaster management. better preparation andtraining of public safety officials and the public, improved mitigation andprevention measures, more efficient and effective response, and morerapid recovery are all possible.5 furthermore, the public has high expectations that technology that it sees deployed ever deeper into other societal systems will be applied to improve the handling of disasters.this chapter discusses six key itbased capabilities that were selectedby the committee because they (1) have the potential to address majorproblem areas in current disaster management practice and (2) representareas where there appears to be significant potential for further advancement of the current state of the art. these capabilities span areas thatcould improve hazard mitigation, disaster preparedness, disaster response, and disaster recovery. they also aim to address requirements ofpractitioners at all levelsñfirst responders, local or regional emergencymanagers, and national emergency managers. improving these capabilities is applicable to addressing natural, accidental, and terroristinduceddisasters, though some capabilities may be more specific to one type.table 2.1 lists these capabilities together with examples of nearterm,midterm, and longterm opportunities for technology development thatwere identified by the committee. some of these technology areas arealready the focus of significant federal research and development investment. for example, selfmanaging and repairing networks are the focusof a defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) research program. some technologies are the focus of considerable research and development investment from the private sector, such as wireless mesh3j.l. wybo

they are in the technology pipeline (discussed in chapter 3), thedegree of specialized technological adaptation required for use in disastermanagement, and the need for organizational changes.the sections that follow examine each of the six key capabilities inmore detail.more robust, interoperable, andprioritysensitive communicationsduring a disaster, both commercial and public safety communicationinfrastructureñtelephone lines, radio towers, communication switches,network operation centers, and the requisite power neededñis often degraded or damaged. simultaneously the demand on communication increases from the public and from first responders. mobile communicationdemand is especially acute. new users from external public safety jurisdictions enter the disaster region. the public may have to be mobilizedfor evacuations. moreover, environments confronted by first responders,such as collapsed buildings, place unusual requirements on communications capabilities. and, finally, hostile action may compromise even thoseresources that survive the initial disaster. simple availability of communications is thus a critical starting pointfor disaster response. communication robustness can be improved byapplying wellunderstood techniques for improving the availability ofsystems, that is, hardening infrastructure, improving network resilienceand adaptability, providing redundancy and diversity, improving component robustness, and optimizing recovery speed. notably, many communications problems are caused by the destruction of communicationdevices or communication lines, by the loss of power to radio towers,switches, and other infrastructure, and by the lack of ability to rechargehandsets and other mobile devices. these are often the result of damageto physical structures (buildings, cell towers). although it is not economically feasible to harden all relevant equipment for worstcase scenarios,improvements are certainly possible.commercial services could provide a valuable complement to dedicated disaster management communications systems by providing redundant infrastructure for voice and data communications. generallyimplemented on a different technology base than that of dedicated systems, they also add diversity. commercial infrastructure, such as the cellular network, is also, by design, highly interoperable.

role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the potential to enhance disaster management39providers in hurricane katrina response and relief efforts hints at thepossibilities of embracing and integrating another type of commercialtechnology into disaster management practice. of course, one reason fordeploying separate public safety radio systems is that they are designedto be more resilient that commercial infrastructure. and public safetyradios are designed to much more stringent operational standards thanmobile phones. yet, both commercial and public safety communicationsinfrastructures have suffered breakdowns in recent disasters.one critical issue that arises in considering commercial services ispriority access. when using commercial services, priority could be provided in a variety of ways. for example, it is possible to set up a cellularnetwork in a spectrum band that is dedicated to disaster management,though cellular handsets would have to be modified (at a significant additional cost) to support this (and the spectrum allocated). alternatively, acommercial service can be used, with arrangements made (preferablyprior to an incident) to reserve a certain fraction of the capacity for prioritized disaster management traffic. of course, priority access to commercial services requires a contractual and regulatory framework as well astechnology adaptation.commercial technology (and adaptations of commercial technology),whether used as part of commercial services or incorporated into dedicated disaster communications systems, could be used to more quicklyleverage the latest technology advances and capabilities. commercialtechnologies provide a range of capabilities supporting voice and data atrapidly increasing transfer rates. two examples of commercial technologies widely embraced by the public which hold potential for disastermanagement are cellular telephony and 802.11 standardsbased wirelessnetworking. cell phones are now used by a large majority of people on adaily basis, so it is natural to continue to use them in a disaster. besidestraditional voice calls, cell phones often also support pushtotalk capabilities, text messaging, and web access, all of which could be usefullyemployed. wireless networking is also becoming ubiquitous in many areas and is supported on laptops and handheld devices. more generally,internet protocol (ip)based communications networks could allow support of emerging ipbased multimedia services, highdatarate access, andmissioncritical tactical group voice and interoperable communicationsduring emergency responses.6 all these technologies are widely usedand relatively inexpensive. their familiarity addresses another issue re6krishna balachandran, kenneth c. budka, thomas p. chu, tewfik l. doumi, and joseph h. kang, òmobile responder communication networks for public safety,ó ieee communications magazine

managementlated to communications robustnessñthe tendency to fall back on technology used routinely.7although some commercial communication technologies have beensuccessfully adopted by some first responders, there is certainly additional scope for using these technologies, often with minimal adaptation,to improve disaster response. rapid deployment of wireless, cellular,and satellite infrastructure to replace infrastructure damaged in a disaster is one such opportunity. mobile, rapidly deployable infrastructurehas the advantage of leveraging commercial technology without necessarily relying on commercial service providers. mobile infrastructure canbe brought in after an event to quickly reestablish communications, (partially) replacing infrastructure lost during the event. mobile cellular technology might also be used to bring cellular infrastructure to rural orother areas lacking predeployed cellular service just as it has alreadybeen demonstrated to bring such service to areas where existing cellularinfrastructure was destroyed.8there are, however, important communications problems that arisein disaster management, especially in response activities, that are unlikely to be addressed in the commercial market. one notable example ismeeting communications needs inside buildings or other enclosed spaces,including damaged structures. possible approaches include mandatingthe deployment of hardened repeaters in buildings, developing and deploying special lowfrequency radios, and developing and deploying lowcost òbread crumbó repeaters for first responders. another example ofsuch a communications problem is the congestion (both local and systemwide) that arises when and where communication is most needed, resulting in a spike in communications traffic, especially in the area whereinfrastructure is likely to be most damaged. handling surging demandthat coincides with reduced capability will require new approaches.not surprisingly, given the number of organizations that must cometogether to cope with a major disaster, the interoperability of communications and other it systems is often cited as a major concern. the overallevolution of communications systems (and, indeed, it more broadly) indisaster management has been characterized by local, agencylevel acquisition and deployment driven by local budgets from local taxing bodies7national research council, summary of a workshop on using information technology toenhance disaster management, the national academies press, washington, d.c., 2005, p.

management41and by local priorities. this has led to the creation of a heterogeneousmixture of voice and (more recently) data systems across the united states.the result is that different public safety agencies (e.g., police, fire, andemergency medical), even in the same community, are often unable tocommunicate or share information with each other. interoperation is nottypically considered when it is acquired. thus, it is not surprising thatlimited technical interoperability exists.concerns about public safety communications interoperability are notnew, though they have received increasing attention in recent years. forexample, the public safety wireless advisory committee (pswac), in a1996 report to the federal communications commission and the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia), concluded that òunless immediate measures are taken to alleviate spectrumshortfall and promote interoperability, public safety will not be able toadequately discharge their obligation to protect life and property in asafe, efficient, and costeffective manner.ó9 a 1997 national institute ofjustice (nij) study that surveyed state and local law enforcement agenciesconfirmed and quantified a number of issues identified in the pswacreport.10additional emphasis has been placed on interoperability and associated issues in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the debate on the transition todigital television, and the response to katrina. the 9/11 commission, forexample, cited first responder voice communications interoperability as aconsiderable issue in the

disasters, and recommendations aimed at addressing interoperability frequently appear prominently in afteraction reports on major disasters. indeed, improved first responder communications wouldhave important benefits in terms of enabling communications across jurisdictions and among fire, police, and medical services. the issue hasdeservedly received attention from the public, government officials, andlawmakers. however, to place this issue in context, it is worth noting thatinteroperability is only one of many significant communications issuesfacing first responders, and first responder communications are not theonly technologyrelated disaster management need (see box 2.1).furthermore, interoperability issues arrive in many guises, from compatibility of waveforms and message formats (technical), to terminologyand definitions (semantic), to practices and procedures (organizational).much of the public attention has been focused on voice communications,but within the public safety community, data communications interoperability is an increasingly critical component and central part of any communications system. data communications interoperability, while havingsome issues in common with voice communications, raises a number ofspecific issues that arise when sharing information from different sources.the 1997 nij study noted the trend toward increasing reliance on information sharing and the importance of data communications interoperability to enable it. (for an overview of interoperability initiatives, seeappendix b.)a number of efforts are underway to increase technical standardization, and a number of technical solutions have been developed that allowsystems such as first responder radios to be òpatchedó together. however, interoperability should not be viewed as solely a technical problem.the harder problem is deciding when the various users across theseinteroperable systems should talk to each other, the protocol for doing so,who can make those decisions, and how teams get formed and dissolved.although information could, in principle, flow arbitrarily in distributed networks, in order to act, some sort of structure is needed. mostinformation is hierarchically organized, but there are many different possible hierarchies, reflecting the need and point of view of the creators.129/11 public discourse project, òfinal report on 9/11 commission recommendations,ódecember 5, 2005.13deficit reduction act of 2005, s. 1932, sec. 3403,

communications issues facingfirst responders. consider the following, for example:¥one cannot interoperate without being able to operate in the first place.simple availability of communications (i.e., operability) is an important consideration because disasters often cause damage to communications systems. bothagility, which makes it possible to more rapidly reconstitute communications, androbustness, which makes it easier to keep communication systems operating, areat a premium. moreover, environments such as collapsed buildings that confrontfirst responders place unusual requirements on communications capabilities.¥no single communication or information system is likely to suffice in a majordisaster, no matter how comprehensive its scope or how much investment hasbeen made in its interoperability or technical robustness. a variety of communications systems may end up being pressed into service, reflecting the value of redundancy.¥technical communications interoperability does not address the challengesof data interoperation among organizations. disaster response often requires access to information held by multiple independent organizations. however, eachorganizationõs information is structured first to benefit its own routine needs andsecondarily to meet nonroutine external needs. experience from many domainsshows that working across these socalled silos cannot be addressed simply byimposing a single standard across all organizations.1first responder communications are far from the only technologyrelated disaster management need. consider the following:¥the very first individuals on the scene of a disaster are likely not first responders but members of the public.¥many other actors and organizations (other than first responders) are involved in managing disasters; their ability to make appropriate decisions and function effectively also depends on it.¥communications and informationprocessing requirements in a disaster arevery heterogeneous, varying according to context, use, time, latency, distance,and bandwidth.1related to this, there may also be different regulatory conditions among organizationsñforexample, the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa) governs how patientsõ health care information can be handled by health care organizations. in the wake ofhurricane katrina, the department of health and human services issued guidance to remindhealth care organizations about hipaaõs emergency provisions. see u.s. department ofhealth and human services

where elements are covered in differenthierarchies, and for good reasons. efforts to determine a priori a òcorrectóinformation hierarchy are often ineffective. thus, simply making communications and systems technically capable to interact may create moreproblems than it solves, unless the deeper meaning of interoperation isunderstood and addressed.improved situational awareness anda common operating picturesituational awareness capabilities, like communications capabilities,have received considerable attention recently, especially in the aftermathof hurricane katrina. involving much more than òhaving all the information,ó situational awareness is an achieved mental state; it does not beginor end with the presentation of data on a display. it is the degree to whichoneõs perception of the situation reflects reality. improving situationalawareness capabilities must include advancing and integrating technology that assists disaster managers in building an accurate and completemental model, in addition to improving the amount and quality of theinformation available. reflecting the difficulties of achieving situationalawareness, one researcher has compiled a list of the òdemons of situational awarenessó (box 2.2). just as it is important to caution that solvingtechnical interoperability is not enough to achieve interoperation amongorganizations, it is important to clearly caution that solving technical situational awareness is not enough. it could enable implementation of solutions to situational awareness demons, but the solutions must come froman understanding of the human dimensions of those demons, and the itsystems incorporate that understanding.as described in chapter 1, an increasing amount of information canpotentially be brought to bear in disaster management. more informationabout a disaster may initially seem like a good thing. yet, data fromdisparate sources can be difficult to assimilate into useful informationbecause of a multitude of formats, the difficulty of placing sensors wherethey are needed, and the difficulty of communicating sensor data to thosewho need it. moreover, without filtering by human or automated mediators, those receiving the information are likely to become overloaded andto ignore excessive inputs as distractions or to devote alreadyscarce resources to monitoring or processing them.research to identify leverage points for it to augment and amplifythe human ability to make sense of data may improve the effectiveness ofdisaster management. òsensemakingó is òthe process of searching for arepresentation and encoding data in that representation to answer taskimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the potential to enhance disaster management45box 2.2eight major demons of situation awareness¥attentional tunneling. good situation awareness is highly dependent on theability to monitor multiple sources of information simultaneously. unfortunately,people frequently lock in on certain aspects of the situation they are trying to processñget tunnel visionñand will either intentionally or inadvertently ignore all other aspects. this leads to their situation awareness of those other aspects becoming quickly outdated. people may believe this is the proper course because theaspect that they are focusing on appears to them to be the most critical. however,keeping at least a highlevel understanding of what is happening across the boardis a prerequisite to being able to know that certain factors are indeed still moreimportant than others. it is often the neglected aspects of a situation that prove tobe fatal. humaninformation interaction systems that foster highbandwidth, lowfidelity assessments of incoming data coupled with lowbandwidth, highfidelityprocessing (e.g., focus plus context techniques) are potential solutions for minimizing these problems.¥requisite memory trap. people have a limited amount of shortterm memory. as they gain experience with an environment (e.g., air traffic control), peoplecan learn to be more efficient at building mental models, allowing them to formmeaningful groupings of information and thereby extend what they can managein shortterm memory. however, the volume and complexity of information required for situation awareness creates situation awareness bottlenecks leadingto memory failures with serious consequences. techniques (e.g., informationvisualization, broadband displays) aimed at expanding human working memorycapacity by offloading information patterns onto external memory may ameliorate these problems.¥workload, anxiety, fatigue, and other stressors. people working in a disaster situation are particularly vulnerable to a number of serious stressors that taxtheir ability to maintain situation awareness. in a situation where lives are at stake,it is not surprising that stress and anxiety could significantly strain a personõs abilityto create and maintain situation awareness. other factors may also come into play(e.g., selfesteem, career advancement). stressors will undermine situation awareness by making the entire process of taking in information less systematic andmore errorprone.¥data overload. a personõs ability to create and maintain a proper mentalmodel of a situation can be overwhelmed by too much input. if more data arereceived than can be processed, situation awareness will quickly become outdated or contain gaps. while it is easy to think of this problem as simply a naturaloccurrence that people are illsuited to handle, in reality it is often a function of theway that data are processed, stored, and presented in many systems. for instance, people are able to process graphical data much more rapidly than textualdata (a picture is worth a thousand words).¥misplaced salience. salience is a measure of how compelling informationappears to be. yet what is most compelling is not necessarily what is most important. this is misplaced salience. the evolutionary process has adapted the humanperceptual system to be more sensitive to certain signal characteristics than othcontinuedimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.46improving disaster managementers. it systems that take advantage of these adaptations can promote or hindersituation awareness. unfortunately, many systems overuse knowledge of humansalience, creating distractions that hinder the creation of proper mental models ofsituation awareness. people are unable to distinguish between false alarms andthe real thing and begin to ignore or filter such input. techniques for highlightingimportant information with preattentive codings, or presenting summaries appropriate to the task could help address this problem.¥complexity creep. many it systems are designed with complex sets offeatures that make it difficult for people to understand how they work or how tooperate them. videocassette recorders (vcrs) are a common example of thisproblem. even automated flight management systems operated by highly trainedpilots suffer from complexity creep. complexity slows down a personõs ability tocorrectly process and properly interpret information presented, ultimately undermining proper understanding of the situation. training is often prescribed as asolution to dealing with complexity, but situations that occur infrequently (e.g.,disasters) mean that a user is likely to have little or no experience with featuresused only in those situations and is highly likely to have forgotten or incorrectlyremember the training.¥errant mental models. mental models form a key interpretation mechanismfor information taken in. they tell a person how to combine disparate pieces ofinformation, how to interpret the significance of that information, and how to develop reasonable projections of what will happen in the future. errant mental modelscause people to misunderstand the situation. mode errors (a special case of errantmental models) cause people to misunderstand information because they believea system to be in one mode when it is in reality in another mode. this type of erroris particularly insidious because it is difficult for people to realize their error. research on it to distribute more attention to highly diagnostic evidence and tosearch for disconfirming relations may provide a leverage point for addressing thisproblem.¥outoftheloop syndrome. excessive or inappropriate automation can leadto this problem, where people are taken out of the decisionmaking loop and leftwith inadequate information about what the automation is doing or the state of thesystem. automation can help situation awareness by reducing workload, but whenautomation reaches situational conditions it is not equipped to handle and theperson has been left out of the loop, he or she may be unable to understand whatis occurring and intervene in the situation.note: the term òsituation awarenessó is used here,

management47specific questions.ó14 there are a number of implications for the development of it to aid human sensemaking, including integrated design ofhuman interfaces, representational tools, and information retrieval systems. sensemaking systems have both front ends (visualization) and backends (content analysis and reasoning) that could aid human ability toskim, power read, recognize patterns, take notes, summarize, drill fordetails, and flag biases.15another factor that can color a personõs understanding of a situationis organizational affiliation. affiliation will drive decision making in earlystages over situational needs. this reflects the need to fall back on ingrained and trusted culture and training when uncertainty is high andtrusted information scarce. over time, if uncertainty decreases and information on the situation increases, affiliation goal drivers dissipate andsituational needs come to drive decisions. however, if there is the perception that the situation is out of control, then affiliation factors again drivethe decision making. situational awareness tools that help build a sharedreality can reduce affiliation and culturally related misperceptions.given the number and variety of relevant parties, a detailed, accurate,and shared picture of both the disaster area and the status of the responseis an obvious requirement for effective management of the disaster, and itis an area where information technology can be of considerable benefit.technologies that can help in the near term include improved resourcetracking (e.g., using radiofrequency identification tags [rfids]), information fusion from a priori known sources, reconciling data collectionwith privacy concerns, and publishsubscribe systems to deliver the information to the appropriate people. longerterm research is needed todevelop largescale embedded sensor networks, automatic calibration ofdata confidence, automatic information fusion and data mining of diverseresources, routing of information to users based on semantics, filtering offalse alarms, and effective presentation of information to users. anotherrelevant area is augmented cognition. darpa is currently funding theimproved warfighter information intake under stress program, whichseeks to enhance human performance in diverse, stressful, operationalenvironments by developing a closedloop computational system inwhich the computer adapts to the state of the human to determine information presentation.data monitoring about situational variables, ranging from longterm14see d.m. russell,

managementvariables (e.g., demographics) to midterm (e.g., status and location ofstockpiles) to immediate (e.g., road and traffic conditions, weather), maybe used to continuously update and adapt both mitigation and responseplans to reflect local issues.finally, continuing advances in unmanned or robotic search and rescue capabilities could improve the ability to obtain access remotely todetailed information about casualties, infrastructure damage, and otherinformation critical to response where responders are unable to reach asquickly or at all. advances in this area hold promise for improving thesafety of responders, as well as the timeliness and effectiveness of response and recovery.improved decision support and resourcetracking and allocationwhereas situational awareness focuses on providing operators anddecision makers with information relevant to their tasks and goals, decision support focuses on assisting them in formulating prospective actions, primarily by helping them understand and assess characteristicsand consequences of alternative courses of action. decision support isabout explicitly recording candidate course(s) of action and generating,analyzing, and evaluating those alternatives. it also provides the means tomonitor the effectiveness and progress of response activities. lines between situational awareness and decision support tend to blurñdecisionsupport is dependent on understanding the situation, and decisions affectthe subsequent situation, thus setting up a continuous feedback loop.some specific examples of how decision support systems might aidresponders include the following: recommending onthefly decisionevaluation, triggering ònaggingó for decisions to be made and executed,tracking down the next alternate decision maker (an assistant chief, forexample), tracking data and underlying simulation models used to makedecisions against the actual situation and presenting warnings when deviations from the model appear, and updating the response plan. furtherexamples include the providing of earlywarning triggers for notificationthat time is running out to exercise an option and the raising of red flagswhen decisions need to be made or when execution lags.one open research challenge is how to support decisions in the face ofsignificant uncertainty. example research topics include computerassisted decisionmaking tools, resource use modeling, risk management inthe face of uncertain data and outcomes, sentinel processes to automatically monitor processes, and technologies that support distributed emergency operations centers. progress on uncertainty management couldimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the potential to enhance disaster management49yield significant progressñperhaps eventually making it possible to takeactions that come well within 90 percent of perfect hindsight.16an especially sensitive aspect of decision support tools deals withtaking humans out of the decision loop. some decisions may be appropriately made using a rulebased decisionmaking process. this could offloadroutine decisions so that human decision makers can focus more attentionon those decisions requiring policybased decision and judgment. determining which decisions can be rulesbased and which policybased andunder what circumstances will require both research and an adoptionstrategy that allows disaster managers time to build trust and confidencein these systems.decision support technology could also facilitate access to and collaboration with other organizations, such as mass media, the private business sector, the army corps of engineers, public health and public works,as well as traditional first responder organizations.17 indeed, the globalcharacter of current information and communications technology meansthat the decision support could come from qualified sources anywhere inthe world.the issue of scalability requires particular attention for decision support systems to be truly effective in a largescale disaster. for disastermanagement, scalability of these systems is intertwined with the issue ofthe dynamics of the situation. it has been implemented on a massivescale, resulting in impressive gains in efficiency and productivity. but theinherent chaos that arises in a disaster creates unique problems for realizing these gains in disaster management practice.closely linked to decision support is the topic of logistics management. the ability to monitor movements of personnel, goods, services,and victims; to recognize mismatches; and to trigger adaptive action(whether it be redirecting the patients or augmenting the facility) wouldgreatly enhance disaster response management. often, retrospectiveanalyses of disaster responses effectively say, òregardless of resourcelimitations, we didnõt make the best use of the resources that we didhave.órouting systems for trucking and airline industries are examples of16laboratory results are already beginning to show early promise toward this possibility: e.g., see r.t. maheswaran, c.m. rogers, r. sanchez, and p. szekely, òreward estimation by communicating aggregated profiles (recap): distributed coordination in uncertain multiagent systems,ó submitted to 20th international joint conference on artificialintelligence, hyderabad, india, january 612, 2007.17for more perspective on collaboration and associated tools, see c.a. bolstad and

andgive human operators feedback on potential options. these systems knowthe resources available and make adjustments based on changes in thestatus of those resources. they handle massive amounts of resources andprocesses in a highly efficient mannerñthey scale extremely wellñaslong as resources are added slowly and in an orderly manner and processes are predictable. they are optimized for bounded, stable situations.they handle problems by planning for a degree of reserve capacity. thesesystems become quickly overwhelmed when reserve capacity is exceeded.the problem of decision support for disaster management is that it isinherently an outofbounds, unstable situation. (see box 2.3 for a discusbox 2.3the limits of commercial logistics operational models fordisaster managementa frequently expressed frustration with recent disaster management effortsconcerns the inefficiency of logistics operations deploying resources (e.g., ice,water, trailers, medical supplies, generators) to affected areas. òif fedex and upscan do it, why canõt disaster managers?ó is a common refrain. as performed todayin disaster management practice, logistics activities tend to make very limited useof information technology (despite the models provided by leadingedge distribution companies).recent investments by the federal emergency management agency havebegun to bring its practices up to date with those of commercial systems, addingsome tracking capabilities, though it appears that much more can be done.1expanding these investments will certainly improve logistics operations. ideally,technologies like radiofrequency identification (rfid) tagging, global positioning system (gps), and others used to manage massive supply chains like thosemanaged by walmart and others could be pervasively implemented for disastermanagement.however, there are critical differences between commercial logistics operations and those required for disasters. these differences mean that even if stateoftheart commercial logistics technologies are adopted, they will go only so far inaddressing the logistics and resource management needs in a disaster. the importance of techniques for recognizing impending problems is not generally understood. thus, the history of military and emergency supply chain management contains periodic calls for blindly adopting commercial methods. rapid shippingcompanies such as fedex are quite rightly lauded for the speed and efficiency oftheir operations. however, the underlying algorithms are designed not to ensurethat all packages are delivered on time, or even that important packages are delivered on time. priorities are handled through channeling into faster shipping methods, but the same algorithms apply. the underlying commercial algorithms determine the schedules and transportation resources needed to ensure that mostpackages will be delivered in timely fashion if the depots and distribution centersdo not change and the situation stays within predicted bounds. the underlyingalgorithms further assume that priorities of packages are undifferentiated withinbroad categories (i.e., if you cannot deliver all packages in a priority class, it isimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.the potential to enhance disaster management51acceptable to allow circumstances to determine which ones get through). theyalso tend to assume that packagesõ priorities do not change once in the systemand that destinations of packages do not change once in the system. if any ofthese assumptions is violated, commercial shipping organizations do the costeffective thing: they apologize, remind customers of disclaimers in the shippingagreement, and perhaps offer a refund.the techniques used by commercial organizations are highly adapted to theirpurpose. they have achieved excellence by developing specialized logistics solutions, but to problems that are qualitatively different from those present duringdisasters. ensuring delivery of critical items in disaster situations is a related problemñbut it is not the same problem. because it is a related problem, techniquesthat have been applied to the commercial problem are relevantñbut recognizingthat they are relevant is not the same as having actually adapted and appliedthem. nor, because the problem is related but different, are those techniques sufficient. when lives depend on a shipmentñdeaths ensue if that shipment is lateñthe function, and thus the underlying algorithms, must be different.disasters are by definition unstable, òoutofboundsó situations. logistics systems developed for them must be designed to handle a complex and evolving setof problems. once problems with a plan or schedule are detected, the critical question is how to revise it to contain the ripple effectsñwhich is essential to minimizingcosts and time delays in adapting to the changed situation.thus, a number of technical challenges differentiate the commercial problemfrom the disaster management problem:1.scale introduced by the surge requirements inherent in disasters,2.complexity introduced by the muchfinergrained and more strongly interacting issues of prioritization,3.complexity introduced by dynamics (managing the risk that actions willbe rendered inappropriate by the fluidity of the situation),4.complexity introduced by information uncertainty (managing the risk thatactions will be rendered inappropriate because they were based on incomplete orinaccurate information), and5.minimally disruptive plan revision.because of the inherent complexity of the number of issues and constraintsthat must be considered, humans are limited in their ability to handle these challenges unaided by technology. instead, for ordinary situations, most approacheshave focused on maintaining reserve capacity as a buffer. a large amount of workin operations research and other fields has focused on techniques for calculatingwhat a safe reserve capacity should be. disasters, by their very definition, exceedavailable resources and overtax the process of effectively allocating them. thus,computing and maintaining safe reserve capacities, although highly necessary, isnot sufficient. intelligent adaptive planning technology that addresses the five challenges listed above is still largely in the research stages. nevertheless, it is acritical capability.1robert block, òfema regroups after katrina, but some question its readiness,ó wallstreet journal, august 7, 2006, p. a1.box 2.3 continuedimproving disaster

commercial logistics operations and logisticsand resource tracking for disaster management.)as performed today in disaster management practice, logistics, resource tracking, and allocation activities tend to make very limited use ofinformation technology (despite the models provided by leading distribution companies). consequently, any notification of problems is likely tobe reactive rather than proactive (e.g., òweõre at the bridge but itõs down.. . . werenõt they supposed to be here by now? . . . why are there only 500childsized crutches when we asked for 5,000?ó).problem notification and consequent situational awareness tend to besequential and therefore subject to propagation delay during which parties can get out of synchronization, rather than having immediate andshared situational awareness. (an alltoofamiliar conversation frequentlystarts with destination asking dispatch, òwhen are they coming?ó anddispatch replying, òtheyõre not there? iõll find out whatõs going on andget back to you.ó). problem resolution processes are unlikely to identifyand simultaneously involve all affected parties, thus producing local instead of global solutions.existing technology makes it quite possible to do much better. withrfid tags, every item, box, pallet, and truck can know and report itsrelationship to the shipping manifest. with the global positioning system(gps) and satellite connections, continuous position reporting is possible.thus, knowing what you have, exactly where it is, and where it is going(even if the destination itself is a moving target) is all possible. geographic information systems make it possible to record and display thatstatus information, while simultaneously recording and displaying otherstatus information such as weather conditions and transportation infrastructure condition.it is easy to set alarms when planned directions of travel and rates ofmotion are not met, and it is feasible for users monitoring these systems tonotice when displays indicate potential barriers to planned movements.when human operators notice problems, routeplanning software cangreatly facilitate rerouting the movements. peertopeer filesharing toolscan ensure that all participants automatically receive updates of the information they need. many such commercially available tools have encryption built in, ensuring the security of shipment information in the event ofextreme situations in which theft or diversion is a concern. exercises suchas strong angel have demonstrated the effectiveness of relatively crudemeasures to provide synchronization, even in situations where conventional communications have broken down (e.g., jeeps or unmanned aerialvehicles [uavs] surveying an area and receiving and rebroadcastingupdate information on wireless network frequencies).1818see strong angel iii at http://www.strongangel3.net.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy

higher levels ofshared situational awareness regarding those problems. functions thatremain problematic, however, include initial decisions about resource allocations, recognition of many problems in the execution of plans andschedules, and development of good repairs to the plans.if these problematic issues are addressed, it is possible to do evenbetter. there are nascent technologies in the research community thatcould make a significant impact. if nurtured and transitioned, these wouldproduce far better initial resource allocations, identify a wider range ofproblems proactively (with significantly greater lead time for resolution),and help develop more effective and globally beneficial solutions to problems as they arise. effective determination of needs requires combiningpushes and pullsñinterrelating, rather than stovepiping, intelligent forecasting of requirements with rapid aggregation of requests.simulation systems provide one useful tool for decision makers totest potential resource allocation and planning options in a virtual environment. they can provide a vehicle to promote understanding and dialogue on actions and issues related to the development of an effectivepreparedness and response plan, and serve as a forum and basis for mutual understanding between agencies and disaster management practitioners. further advances in simulation environments promise to providecomprehensive modeling frameworks that integrate both inverse and forward points of view, applicable at multiple levels of analysis in diversefields of study, in a structured manner. computational architecture that isflexible, scalable, and adaptable promises the ability to create persistentvirtual worlds for continuous replication, verification, validation, uncertainty quantification, and marginoferror estimations.alternative recovery plans could be developed and tested in the context of simulations and risk models that allow plan effectiveness to betested and that enable continuous adaptation of plans in light of availableresources and past experience. instrumentation and data collection arecritical elements for learning from one disaster to amend managementpractices of future events. data collected during response and recoveryoperations can also be used in postdisaster analyses to feed future mitigation efforts. it can be used to validate and improve models and simulations. learning from instrumentation and postincident analysis haveproven invaluable in other fields, such as health (with todayõs emphasison evidencebased medicine), defense (where the military collects reportsand other data from exercises and operations to develop lessons learnedthat are fed back into the development of both doctrine and weaponssystems), and air transportation (where the national transportationsafety board investigates every civil aviation accident in the united statesin order to improve the reliability and operational safety of airplane

indeed, in most of these fields incorporation of lessons learned ishighly systematized to ensure timely implementation of changes in practices and systems.advances in highperformance computing are now demonstratingthe ability to execute, log, and analyze discrete event simulations withliterally millions of separate ongoing computational processes. these havebeen integrated into wargames extending over weeks, involving tens andhundreds of thousands of human personnel. this means that it is becoming technically feasible to run situation analysis systems for disasters thatcontinuously operate on òbest available understandingóñfilling in missing information with simulations, models, and forecasts when necessary,replacing them with sensor data, situation reports, and incoming supplyrequests when available.advances in computing power, as well as the development of newalgorithms, also create the prospect of adaptive planning, scheduling, andresource allocation processes that continually finetune logistical supportplans to the evolving situation. these algorithms are increasingly able toreason about managing the risk of a plan in the face of various kinds ofuncertainty. one type of uncertainty concerns information quality. (howsure are we that the roads are passable?) another type concerns the likelihood of success for potential courses of action. (since we donõt knowwhether a convoy from the north will get through quickly, would it makesense to also route some of the supplies from the south or to send excessshipments that will be redirected if the others get through?)in addition, advances both in power and accessibility of highperformance computing combined with new algorithms are pointing the waytoward automated solutions of increasingly larger planning and scheduling problems. not only are the algorithms more efficient, but techniquessuch as òbackdoorsó and hybrid problem solvers have shown how largeproblems can be transformed into simpler and more manageable ones.òbackdoorsó is a technique for identifying critical decisions within a largeset of alternatives that, once made, reduce the number of other optionsthat have to be considered without significantly reducing the likelihoodthat the best overall choices are still made. hybrid problem solving is arelated technique in which fast but òsuboptimaló techniques are used toproduce rough sketches of plans, which are examined for characteristicsthat can be used to restrict the options considered by slower, higherquality algorithms.taken together, these techniques offer a future in which much moreefficient plans are generated on the basis of much more meaningful information. this ensures that responses are initiated with the besttunedcourses of action available at

ofshipped items. the first element of this, tracking the items, is increasinglyeasy (see above). the next challenge is to use the tracking information totrigger warnings that a shipping plan is going awry. as noted above, thetechnology is basically in place to do this by asking, òis it where it shouldbe at this time?ó however, it is possible to do better than that. if a bridgeon the trucking route is down, rerouting should start as soon as any partof the system knows that factñrather than waiting for an overtaxed human to notice, much less waiting until the trucks get to the bridge.darpa has funded related research in the areas of plan sentinels andmathematical approaches for estimating progress and probability of success on goal structures. plan sentinels extend a range of existing planningtechniques that use explicit descriptions of goals and methods for achieving those goals. plan sentinels focus on capturing assumptions underlying methods and generate software in order to explicitly monitor datastreams for evidence that those assumptions are violated. for example,driving a truck from point a to b is a method for getting to a locationwhich assumes that roads and bridges are intact, so plan sentinel softwarewould generate code for monitoring data streams and routing traffic reports. in contrast to plan sentinels, the mathematical approaches adapttechniques such as nonlinear filtering methods (previously used to trackprogress in geometric spaces) in order to track progress in symbolicspaces. these techniques generate probability distributions that can beused to assess likelihood of the òspeed and directionó of future progresson the plans.symbolic approaches like plan sentinels and mathematical techniquessuch as just described can make complementary contributions to the ability to proactively predict problems and to begin as early as possible torespond to them.greater organizational agility fordisaster managementdisasters are varied and no single organizational structure is necessarily the best for dealing with the range of possible incidents. duringdisaster response, organizations must be able to form quickly and workwell together across space and time. they must be able to adapt andresize easily as the disaster develops. the 9/11 disaster expanded in scopeand scale in a matter of hours even as the primary emergency operationscenter was lost within the world trade center complex. the nationalresponse plan and national incident management system provide frameworks for dynamic organizations to be formed, but do not address thediversity of technology in different organizations, the lack of rapport, orthe ability of organizations to quickly integrate operations. they also arimproving disaster management: the role of it in

are inflexible and work against the idea that agility and flexibility are at least asimportant as command and control hierarchy.simulation systems offer one avenue for training disaster management professionals, from first responders to disaster managers, to betteranticipate problems and to become more flexible and adaptable to working across organizational boundaries, integrating operations, and adapting to different technologies. simulation systems can simultaneously interface with and drive both planning systems and training systems.19this would enable preparatory work to ensure the robustness of plansagainst multiple scenarios. it could also support training according to theplans and seamless transition into systems for response execution. usingdetailed analysis of the response to past disasters, these simulations wouldbe solidly grounded in reality, and their accuracy would increase witheach incident.capturing lessons learned and making them available in a form useful to the broad community of disaster management is another area ofpotential for it to support organizational learning. learning from pastexperiences is an important element supporting the ongoing improvement of disaster management. lessons learned can cover a wide range oftopicsñfrom experience with specific processes and organizational structures to the effectiveness of specific communication technologies or software systems. the department of homeland security has establishedlessons learned information sharing (http://www.llis.gov) as a mechanism for disseminating lessons learned.20 it provides an illustration ofhow the internet can be used to support dissemination of lessons learned.nevertheless, lessons learned from previous disasters have not typicallypropagated quickly through the disaster management community.another organizational issue is management of the flow of personnelin and out of an incident area. improved it infrastructure for credentialingand identification checksñwho they are, whether they have the capabilities they say they haveñcould improve the efficiency of response andrecovery operations, such as dispatching medical workers, repair technicians, and other appropriate people into a disaster area. in the aftermathof hurricane katrina, much damage to information and communications19several areas of potential opportunity to improve disaster

enhance disaster management57infrastructure was fixable, or there were backups and alternatives. however, the lack of access because of the security ring around new orleansand limited means for authorities to quickly validate peopleõs credentialsmeant that repairs could not be effected; generators ran out of fuel andalternatives could not be switched in. similar problems involving physical access were cited during the response to 9/11.21 recent credentialingefforts for emergency responders, including databases to keep track ofvolunteers, have been advancing and expanding to include telecommunications specialists, utilities workers, and other privatesector disaster response workers.authentication and credentialing constitute a complex topic, involving many technical and nontechnical issues.22 a few example areas ofwhere further it research might bear fruit include voice print analysis inthe network, fingerprint sensor on the pushtotalk radio buttons,23 rfidtags (badges), and verbal authorization codes issued to first respondersand other authorized personnel (e.g., city workers, volunteers, and so on)that are linked to the radios. in addition, backend database and architectural considerations regarding the identity and credentialing management system as a whole also merit attention. currently, as with internetpurchase orders, identity authentication is accomplished through the verification of several independent pieces of information, not one code orpassword. in the case of false negatives, lost tags, mismatches betweentag and radio, and so on, one model of mitigationis for the system totransfer the transaction to a dispatcher who could decide whether sufficient evidence exists to authorize authentication. the entire realm ofcredentialing and identity management is clearly a fruitful research area.further advances are needed to improve understanding of how communication structures map onto organizational structure requirements.dynamic authority mapping is one potentially useful tool.in the short term, information technology is likely to be appliedchiefly to automate and accelerate traditional disaster management processes and practices. in the midterm to long term, however, increases ininformationprocessing capacity offer the potential to enable a transfor21see, for example, national research

reserved.58improving disaster managementmation of those very processes by enabling innovation in organizationalpractices. such itdriven shifts have occurred in many sectors, with major organizational implications.24 although these transformations arenot entirely predictable, the empirical evidence suggests a number ofpossibilities.the militaryõs hierarchical command chain is one wellknown organizational model for managing extremely complex, distributed activities. itreflects the development over many years of a clear sense of what tocentralize and what to decentralize. in recent years, the military has undertaken significant, itenabled revisions to doctrine based on the idea ofproviding more information to individual units or warfighters and enabling increasingly distributed networkcentric operations. the committee believes that a similar analysis and evolution of doctrine that takesinto account the unique characteristics of disaster management (such asdiverse actors and jurisdictions in a federal system and the important roleof privatesector organizations) as well as new technological capabilitiesare also needed.one such possible shift would be from informationcentered architectures updated in batches (e.g., òreportsó) toward distributed processingof continual messagingstreams fed by pervasive sensors providing realtime situational awareness data, with different users detecting trends andtransitions according to their local requirements. there could be a corresponding shift from specialized management systems that are activatedfor disasters and deactivated afterward to an òalwaysonó state of activation that varies more in scale than in nature as events occur. a moveshould also be possible from command models of resource managementtoward negotiated òbrokerageó approaches working with current modelsof the best actions that can be taken with available resources. anotherpossibility is the ability to reach a mature compromise between the dualextremes of rigid bureaucracy and alltoall interoperability toward aòmanaged adhocracyó of disaster management and responder organizations that can evolve seamlessly and continuously over the entire courseof a disaster. finally, a rolebased concept of individual and unit identitycould reduce the significance of jurisdictional, disciplinary, and even official/civilian distinctions. the cumulative effect of these changes could bea shift from a mechanical focus on preserving and restoring the status quoante toward a flexible strategy of resilience and adaptability to the dynamics and inherent complexities of disasters.a common organizational theme is the strong tension between cen24jason dedrick, vijay gurbaxani, and kenneth l. kraemer, òinformation technologyand economic performance: a critical review of the empirical evidence,ó acm computingsurveys 35(1):128, 2003.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and

distributed nature of most disasters. authorities may want to beseen as òin charge,ó even though most of the actual work in disastersresults from the many lesscoordinated and distributed actions of individuals. responders typically bring tremendous energy to the scene. oneresponse is to put someone in charge to channel (and bind) this energy.another is to let the energy emerge and then harvest it. organizationshave a hierarchical comfort zone that has driven them to the former response, but disasters are also accompanied by the rapid development ofemergent multiorganizational networks.25these networks form the locus for collective sensemaking and organizational learning under conditions where ambiguity and uncertaintyare an inherent part of the environment.26 information technology couldsupport emergent networks by helping them deal more effectively withunpredictable information sources, lowering barriers to information flow,making organizational boundaries more permeable, and easing coordination between diverse and distributed actors. for example, a number ofemergent groups, existing in entirely virtual space and formed using theinternet and technology such as blogs and wikis, performed importantservices during hurricane katrina. research to find more systematic waysto leverage such technology may yield new means for supporting emergent networks.while this report is primarily limited to the it aspect of disaster management and did not specifically look at problems from an organizationaltheory or management theory point of view, the potential contributionsthat management and organizational science can make to better understanding the situation in command centers and to improving other aspects of disaster management are undoubtedly significant. moreover, asresearch progresses in these areas, analysis both of the impacts that greateruse of it may have and of how it can help ameliorate other problems willbe useful. for instance, organizational research on collective sensemakingcould help focus it research on how to address confusion that stems fromambiguous information rather than simply finding better ways to reduceignorance arising out of uncertainty by increasing the quantity and quality of information.27another common theme, and one that came up frequently in testi25kathleen tierney and joseph trainor, ònetworks and

variousactors involved in responding to a disaster. but in a disaster situation,cooperation is often required between people who are strangers with noexisting trust relationship. thus, approaches and supporting technologies are needed that aid coordination and structure across people andorganizations that have little trust but some common goals. itõs ability toenhance organizational agility in disaster management may be limitedby the extent to which it is unable to overcome barriers to working in anenvironment of limited trust. applying existing understanding about therelationship between trust and technology and extending that knowledge through further research will be critical to advancing organizational agility.better engagement of the publictwo distinct aspects of better engagement of the public through better use of it involve (1) the use of warning systems and broadcast alerts toinform the public of actions that they should take to protect themselvesand their property and (2) the ability to leverage the public as providers ofinformation and sources of valuable technology tools. the potential toimprove the use of it in both areas is substantial, although the second willalso require considerable shifts in culture among public safety and emergency management professionals.alerting and warning systemsimproving warning systems for various types of disasters has received considerable attention, especially in the aftermath of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami.28 effective warnings save lives, reduce damage, andspeed recovery. warnings are most effective under the following circumstances:¥they are accurate and result in appropriate action.¥any probabilistic aspects (e.g., likely hurricane landfall probabilities) are clearly communicated.¥they are standard, consistent, and easily understood.¥they are delivered to just the people at risk and in a timelymanner.¥they are delivered through a variety of mechanisms to achievemaximal reach.28subcommittee on disaster

to makeaccurate predictions about natural disasters. public education has improved actions that people take in response to warnings. experience andpolicy changes have made authorities better at communicating consistent, clear messages. further improvements are possible in all of theseareasñespecially through broader deployment of sensor systems and further advances in sensor technology. but, there is now a significant gap inhow warnings are delivered and what is possible with existing technology.forecasting and sensing technology has made it possible for sirenbased warnings to be issued minutes to seconds before the onset of adisaster where previously no warning was possible, and future advancesmay improve detection and lengthen warning times (earthquake detection is one such promising area). where the time for delivering alerts isstill very short, sirens can be highly effective because they can be rapidlyand broadly disseminated. sirens require people to know what action totake (e.g., for a tornado find shelter, under ground if possible). publiceducation and drills are used to instill this knowledge. stateoftheartsiren technology can now include a public address capability, allowingmore specific information to be communicated. however, sirens are inherently outdoor systems. they are valuable because they may reachpeople who would otherwise receive no warning. they will continue toplay an important role in alerting the public, and technology advancescan make them even more effective.warning systems using information and communications networkscan be significantly upgraded using existing and emerging technologies.the congressional research service report emergency communications:the emergency alert system (eas) and allhazard warnings describes anumber of government efforts to develop a digital warning system, including the ongoing pilot projects of the federal emergency managementagency, the information analysis and infrastructure protection directorate at dhs, and the association of public television stations to developan integrated public alert and warning system.29a presidential executive order of june 26, 2006, aims to

challenge of reaching the entire affected populationñincluding all social and socioeconomic groups, disabled, elderly,and other specialneeds groupsñbefore, during, and after a disasterstrikes were highlighted by hurricane katrina. more generally, reachingthese groups is among the most significant of issues relating to engagingthe public to ensure their own survival and recovery during disasters.hurricane katrina tragically demonstrated the error in assuming that better communications alone guarantees effective public engagement.34 italso served as a reminder that access to and familiarity with informationtechnology is not universal. further, the ability to act on available information, even when it is accessible, may be limited.31see federal communications commission (fcc),

disaster management63risk communicationunderstanding what information should be provided to the publicbefore, during, and after a disaster falls under the general topic of riskcommunications, which an earlier national research council report defines as òan interactive process of exchange of information and opinionsamong individuals, groups, and institutions [and] a dialog involvingmultiple messages that express concerns, opinions, or reactions to riskmessages or to legal and institutional arrangements for risk management.ó35 insights from such work can be used to inform future efforts toapply it for improved risk communication.the public as an information and technology resourcewhile warning and alerting systems are important, their perspectiveis of the center talking out to the masses. the committee finds vast potential to further engage the public by changing this perspective to embracetwoway communications between authorities and the public. interactions with the public are an important part of disaster management, yetthese interactions have received relatively little attention. changes in technology available to the public mean that there are not only new ways toreach them (with warnings), but also new ways for the public to bothgather and communicate information. one typically thinks of the publicplaying a passive role of information receiver in a disaster. people havethus far been engaged only marginally and conditionally as sources ofinformation with valuable technology in critical or otherwise unreachablelocations (e.g., certified amateur radio operators). the now ubiquitous911 emergency calling system is an example of how responders can getuseful information from the public. it is a simple mechanism for allowingthe public to report information.yet, there is potential for the public to play a much larger role duringa disaster, and information technology is increasingly making it possibleto engage the public in a variety of ways. civiliansñpeople on the streetñare nearly always the very first people on the scene of disaster, especiallyin situations with little or no warning. collectively they have a richerview of at least a small portion of a disaster situation than is availablefrom within an emergency operations center. even 10 years ago mostpeople carried little or no technology around with them. today, much of35national research

academy of sciences. all rights reserved.64improving disaster managementthe public has sophisticated mobile communication and sensing capability. camera phones, wikis, the web, and text messaging are all capabilities increasingly available to people on the scene. harnessing these sourcesof valuable information holds great promise for providing critical information to disaster managers, especially in the initial response stages.victims can be transformed into actively engaged responders if givena meaningful and appropriate means to participate. they can be recruitedto assist in disaster response. they can be kept informed as to how andwhen to act appropriately. furthermore, they can offer critical redundantit resources as traditional sources are impacted by a disaster. it mechanisms that interface disaster response agency information systems to interactive public communications channels (e.g., internet, wireless communication) could provide information gathering and disseminationmechanisms that ameliorate problems of agency overload from affectedpopulations seeking situational information or having the ability to provide local information.the redundancy of this approach would also improve the reliabilityof the communications with the attendant advantages of improved performance and public perception of appropriate actions. valid concernsabout the trustworthiness of information have inhibited any major stepstoward incorporating these types of changes more fully. yet, changes inthe amount and quality of technology carried by individuals and continuing advances in filtering, qualifying, and analyzing information of uncertain quality means that a major opportunity may be missed for makingbetter use of it, especially given limited resources available to publicofficials.the strong angel exercises have explored òtechniques and technologies that support the principle of resilience within a communityó with theobjective of effectively tapping òthe expertise and creativity within anaffected community, including through publicprivate partnerships. asecond overarching objective is the development of social tools and techniques that encourage collaborative cooperation between responders andthe population they serve during postdisaster reconstruction.ó36cybercitizen networks also hold promise as an important new element of response similar to, but on a much larger scale than, the role filledby amateur radio operators. it can help facilitate these interactions. in thenear term it is possible to use or adapt existing technologies to createvalidated online information sources, to deploy multimodal public reporting sites, and to build directories of private resources to facilitate36see strong angel iii at

to enhance disaster management65deployment. research is needed into technologies that do dynamic capability profiling and credentialing, semantic routing, and filtering ofmultimodal public input, and research is also needed to optimize dataformatting for diverse terminal devices.enhanced infrastructure survivability andcontinuity of societal functionsdisasters inherently cause disparate communities, infrastructures,and organizations to interact (and not interact) in unanticipated ways.hurricane katrina is an obvious example, having displaced much of anentire metropolitan region, with residents being dispersed across thecountry. but smallerscale disasters also disrupt societal functions. families and friends are separated. families need access to housing, schoolsfor children, and social services. people lose access to medical facilitiesand medical records. jobs are lost. important cultural institutions are disrupted. there is considerable opportunity for improving the use of it toreconnect people, provide a temporary bridge to restore and maintainrelations and interactions, and to speed their restoration. hurricanekatrina demonstrated that people can come together, using the internetand other information and communications technologies, to apply knowledge, skills, and technology to have a positive impact on the lives of thoseaffected by a disaster.37another wellpublicized example of an emergent use of it was thecreation of wikis38 that enabled volunteers to connect with victims. someof the functions wikis served in the aftermath of katrina were listinghelpline numbers, posting offers of temporary shelter, identifying whereand how to make donations, serving as a clearinghouse for identifyinggovernment resources, offering health and safety information, sharingadvice and experience on relocation, publicizing fundraising events, providing information about lost and found pets, reconnecting families, andposting helpneeded notifications. the emergent behavior exhibited bythese wikis is one of their great strengthsñrising to meet an unanticipated and highly diffuse need. they are highly flexible and adaptable and37for example, see

managers is to leverage the power of these emergentuses of itñand support research and development to advance their application to disaster managementñwithout destroying their inherent flexibility and adaptability.in addition to making better use of it to help people, it can be used toimprove the survivability of critical infrastructureñanother major factorin speeding recovery and restoring societal functions. the committeeheard numerous possibilities for advancing it and extending its applications to improve the resilience and management of critical infrastructuresystems, such as the electric grid, water, transportation, housing, andhealth care. the interdependencies between these systems are often notwell understood and rarely proactively engineered for resilience becausethey are usually designed and operated by independent entities over along period of time. the structural couplings between these systems mayalso manifest themselves on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales,making it difficult to quantify them. solving these problems requires different jurisdictionsñcities, counties, statesñto work closely with eachother and with federal agencies. the restoration of new orleans, for example, is widely understood to require a concerted rebuilding across government agencies, public safety organizations, businesses, and public utilities. simply clearing damage, processing insurance claims and othercompensation, and rebuilding residential, government, and commercialinfrastructure constitute a very complex, multifaceted process that is likelyto take years to complete.advances in it can revolutionize other technical disciplines with direct and indirect implications for advances in disaster management. asalient example is the entirely new class of monitoring and control capabilities made available to civil and mechanical engineers by the creationof small sensors, microprocessors and wireless communication devices.many applications require the deployment and use of sensors on a widescaleñcapabilities that are starting to emerge from research into distributed sensor networks.when terrorists attacked the world trade center in new york inseptember 2001, thousands of occupants of those doomed structures hadan hour to escape. but delays in the assessment of the structuresõ integritystole crucial minutes from the evacuation and ultimately doomed thousands of innocent civilians. today it is possible to instrument such structures using sensors and wireless connections, in such a way that the changing forces within the towersõ structures could be recognized and evaluatedalmost instantly.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences.

time ofresponders by routing them around damaged or clogged routes. supervisory control and data acquisition systems for water, gas, and other utilities are being enhanced to provide detailed analysis of damage due toearthquakes or explosions, enabling system operators to speed restoration and minimize peripheral disruptions of service.the benefits of comprehensive monitoring and management of engineered systems can extend beyond their own boundaries, for examplemanaging interactions between systems, such as the power grid and thecommunication networks that rely on them. this underscores the importance not only of collecting systemspecific data but also of normalizingand exchanging realtime assessment data between systems.buildings, roads, and other constructed infrastructure exhibit significant resilience and robustness in the face of disaster. however, infrastructure that appears to be intact may in fact have been severely damaged inways that are not readily apparent. for example, in the wake of an earthquake, a building might be on the verge of collapse or a bridge might beready to fail after even the smallest aftershock. by making hidden damagemore apparent, sensors combined with information technology can enhance response and recovery operations by reducing uncertainty aboutthe state of infrastructure.continuous monitoring and analysis of critical infrastructure couldbe done by developing new instrumentation capabilities. this would enable the routing of sensor information from buildings, bridges, and infrastructure systemsñfor example, roads and water, gas, sewer, communications, and power systemsñto monitoring locations, providingresponders with information about the robustness and safety of the infrastructure affected. as in other areas, power supply independent of theelectric grid is a critical issue that must be addressed to extend sensorcapabilities.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and

andadoption issues confronting the various federal, state, and localagencies and private organizations (hereinafter called disaster management organizations) that have official responsibility for disaster management. it does not explore the complex issues of it acquisition or adoption by individuals or private firms for use in disasters; however, it doesbriefly consider opportunities for leveraging it systems and services ofprivatesector firms, citizens, and nongovernmental organizations. thechapter starts by considering some of the key barriers to more effectiveuse of it in disaster management. it then discusses some best practicesand design principles that would help address these barriers. it concludeswith a discussion of roadmapping as a technique for guiding overall investment in research and development and a discussion of multidisciplinary centers as a way of better coupling it research and practice.overview of nontechnical barriersmany sectors, such as banking, manufacturing, and services, havebeen able to adopt new it technologies routinely and aggressively. somedisaster management organizations have also been quite effective in integrating stateoftheart it technologies into their daytoday operations(e.g., the use of internet protocol [ip]based emergency management tools,the use of cell phones to listen in on first responder land mobile radiotraffic, and the use of laptops and wireless local area networks). however,improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.improving acquisition and adoption of it69in the committeeõs view, the disaster management community has notbeen nearly as broadly successful.the following are among the complicating factors:¥disaster management organizations often lack the resources to acquirevaluable capabilities. responsibility for disaster management is widely distributed among agencies and organizations at all levels of governmentñwith resources and operational responsibilities mainly concentrated atthe local level. these organizations have vastly different technologies andcapabilities. these characteristics lead to highly scattered adoption andlengthy adoption cycles and a highly fragmented market for disaster management it. moreover, many of the organizations are small and have veryconstrained budgets for it. most acquisition resources are focused oncapabilities to improve daytoday operations, whereas disaster management is, by definition, not a routine activity. some of what agencies doacquire specifically for disaster incidents nonetheless becomes òshelfwareóñunused even when the need for which it was acquired arises.¥both the development and the deployment of many promising technologies are risky and costly compared with the opportunity presented by the commercial market for these technologies today. for example, there are sensorsthat would be very useful for assessing in real time the status of the builtenvironment. however, developing and manufacturing such sensors forthe uncertain and highly costconstrained disaster management marketdo not constitute attractive commercial opportunity at this time.¥in most agencies with disaster management responsibilities, there is noone who is charged specifically with tracking it technology, identifying promising technologies, integrating them into operations, or interacting with it vendors to make sure that needs are addressed. many organizations are too smallto grow and support significant inhouse expertise, and they naturallylook to vendors to provide turnkey solutions, which may mean that theorganizationõs longterm, broad needs are not fully met. long intervalsoccur between acquisitions, with the result that any institutional learningthat does occur is likely lost in the interim. the acquisition dynamicscreated by this situation tend to limit the potential market, leading itvendors to adapt it technologies only slowly for use in disaster management. there is no focal point for addressing these issues at the federallevel, further contributing to the problem. finally, the complexity of itsystems and the organizational changes that they introduce are often metwith resistance and ambivalence by both managers and users, especiallyin the absence of a technology òchampion.ó¥decisions regarding it tend to be made independently by local organizations that must work together in disasters. organizations with disaster management responsibilities are typically highly independent and have limimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences.

interoperability issues at many levels. state and federal organizations charged withdisaster management face similar coordination challenges, further complicating collaboration in responding to a disaster. acquisition managersconcerned about collaboration typically have no place to go to determineif the technologies they are acquiring will interoperate with those of theirpeers. further, no mechanism exists for them to synchronize technologyacquisitions in order to make them compatible. recent trends toward theestablishment of regional groups to address it and related disaster management issues are a promising trend.¥disaster management is concerned with environments that are intrinsically uncertain and unstable. this contrasts with the typical it acquisitionenvironment, where development, deployment, operation, and maintenance take place in fairly well understood and stable environments andwhere requirements are better understood.¥important sources of funds are typically only available once a disaster hasbeen declared and must also be spent in a short window of time. funds tend tobecome available in much greater quantity during a period of time afterdisaster declarations. experienced emergency managers are well aware ofthis recurrent òwindow of opportunityó effect, and many of them keep itand communications projects in draft, ready to proceed as soon as a disaster redirects attention and money to their needs. however, these purchases are naturally driven by immediate concerns rather than longerterm considerations.one conclusion (overly pessimistic in the committeeõs view) giventhese barriers would be that advanced it solutions are impractical formost local governments and emergency management agencies. such aview assumes that the existing problems are insurmountable, whereas thecommittee believes that many of these problems can be mitigated if bestpractices and principles are followed and if appropriate mechanisms areput in place to support their adoption, such as the research centers thatcouple technology advancement with practice and communitywide technology roadmapping.another related potential misreading of the challenge is that technology that is òadvancedó or òleadingedgeó is necessarily more complexñand is thus unsuited for organizations without considerable inhousetechnology expertise. in fact, some trends in information technologyare in exactly the opposite direction, with advances aimed at reducedcomplexity from the standpoint of those acquiring, managing, or usingthe technology. a reflexive avoidance ofadvanced technology and newimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.improving acquisition and adoption of it71developmentscould thus counterproductively translate into a failure toadopt systems that are more robust, reliable, and usable.best practices for acquisitionbest practices for acquisition include an emphasis on iterative development; increased opportunities to test and evaluate technology in practice, together with realistic concepts of operations; and design and evaluation processes that allow for strong coupling among practitioners,researchers, and industry.from waterfall acquisition to iterative developmenthistorically, as in many other areas, the introduction of technology indisaster management has been characterized by a series of major deployments, occurring at intervals sometimes measured in years or even decades. these long cycle times reflect in part the traditional òwaterfallóacquisition process. this acquisition model presumes a linear development process that proceeds in stages from development of a comprehensive requirements specification to design, then to implementation followed by integration, next to testing, then to installation, and finally tomaintenance. modified versions of the model acknowledge some role forfeedback between each of these stages and preceding ones.1 they alsomirror the typical capital planning cycles of federal, state, and local government and agencies, which have traditionally made periodic, large investments in new systems and capabilities.long acquisition cycles are well known to make it hard to incorporaterapid technological change. the doubling of various measures of computing performance every 1 to 2 years places an obvious premium on processes that can more rapidly incorporate new technology. moreover, thislinear process that periodically seeks to produce the solution often fails todeliver the expected capabilities. requirements creep may end up makingthe ultimate design overly cumbersome, complex, or costly to implement,leading to cost overruns, delays, and even program cancellation. users,who only have input to the front end of the process, may find that thedelivered capabilities do not meet their needs.also, new capabilities and technology opportunities that arise after1this development process is described in terms of the software development modelexplicated in considerable detail by barry w. boehm, software engineering economics,prentice hall, upper saddle river, n.j.,

system development leaves the initial requirements stage are difficultand expensive to incorporate. the reason is that many artifacts of a system grow organically. the practical reality is that large systems emergefrom incremental additions in ways entirely unanticipated by the designers of the original system. if the original system is successful, users willalmost certainly want to add new functionality. the new functionalitydesired is by definition unanticipatedñif the designers had known itwould be useful, they would have included it in the first place.indeed, it is essentially impossible in practice for even the most operationally experienced it systems developers to be able to anticipate indetail and in advance all of a systemõs requirements and specifications.often users change their minds about the features they want, or (evenmore difficult to deal with) they want contradictory features. and, ofcourse, it is difficult indeed to anticipate all potential uses. thus, systemrequirements and specifications are inherently incomplete, even thoughthey underlie and drive the relationships among various components ofthe system. put differently, the paradox is that successful system development requires nontrivial understanding of the entire system in its ultimate form before the system can be successfully developed. system designers need experience to understand the implications of their designchoices. but experience can be gained only by making mistakes, learningfrom them, and having a mechanism to modify and evolve systems overtime as the understanding of both user and designer grows and as requirements and technology evolve.for these reasons, development methodologies have been developedthat presume an iterative approach to building systems. an iterative process uses multiple, short acquisition cycles, which over time deliver andimprove on system capabilities. such a process encourages feedback fromusers and allows them to play a constructive and central role in a systemõsevolution. an iterative process requires, among other things, mechanismsfor users to provide feedback to technology innovators and providers.(the committee discusses some possible mechanisms for supporting thisprocess later in this chapter.)with iterative development, systems that initially include limitedfunctionality are often introduced. as users adopt the technology, theyhave a mechanism for identifying improvements to that functionality andfor identifying desirable new features that technology providers can incorporate into the new product versions. the progression of mobile phonefunctionality to incrementally include increasingly greater performanceand a wider range of features is a familiar example of this process.an iterative acquisition process has other advantages. often requirements thought to be essential turn out to be relatively unimportant orlittle used once deployed. the functionality supporting those requireimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.improving acquisition and adoption of it73ments can be dropped from future product versions, helping minimizecomplexity creep. essential features frequently go unidentified until thesystem begins to be widely used. these features can be added in a moreorderly fashion, evolving the system with continuing feedback from users. incremental introduction of technology also allows one to exploit thecurrent technology òsweet spotóñwhere the costs of components such asmicroprocessors are lowestñkeeping down costs and making more frequent acquisition cycles possible.in disaster management a tension inevitably arises between a naturaldesire to fully meet demanding or perceived unique requirements andthe cost and speed of development and deployment. disaster management professionals often say that they must be able to depend òabsolutelyó on the technology they employñnoting the lifeordeath natureof their work. an iterative process allows time for users to build trust inthe systemõs ability to deliver on those critical requirements and a mechanism for providing feedback to request (or demand) changes as needed.it also allows an opportunity to minimize initial demands for uniquerequirements involving specialized equipment and maximizing the opportunity to incorporate òcommodityó components, thus minimizing costand delays.metricsdriven investmentas the saying goes, one can only manage what one can measure. theresources available for disaster management are limited, and decisionmaking always involves tradeoffs. to motivate the it expendituresneeded to provide adequately for disaster management, there must be anunderstanding of the benefits that are obtainable. weighing the availablebenefits from particular it investments against the returns on other sortsof investment is challenging. when considering the effects of disasters,these tradeoffs can easily be driven by emotions, even more than in manyother sectors. having metrics allows an analytical assessment to be made,comparing the costs of preventive and mitigating investments with thelikely impacts of disasters, and with other potential investments. thesections that follow briefly discuss several aspects of metricsbased decision making. the development of suitable metrics to guide investment init for disaster management is a topic for further research and somethingthat a roadmapping effort (described later in this chapter) might address.estimating risksestimating the risks of infrequent events is hard, but failing to consider risks explicitly cripples any rational decisionmaking process. gathimproving disaster

will necessarily be an iterative process,with initial information providing a basis for further discussion, expansion, and revision. an additional benefit of systematizing this process isthe potentially useful feedback on needs and opportunities that it canprovide to the technology research and development community.costs and benefitsthe economic model needed to assess the tradeoff of the costs versusthe benefits of investing in technology for disaster mitigation differs frombusiness investment models. typical business investments are related toa steady income stream, not to a variety of infrequent future costs andbenefits. an economic model for disaster management must combine initial investments, ongoing costs, and infrequent events. an investment isbased on the net present value, computed using some discount rate for allthose components. those rates incorporate the expected lifetime of theassets and the risks associated with deriving income from those assetsover that period. for business it investments, those rates typically varyfrom 12 to 20 percent. communication infrastructure has used muchlower discount rates in the past, but the merger of those technologies isforcing the rates for those investments upward.any technology deployment has initial costs, as well as ongoing maintenance and training costs, and a finite life. this long horizon requiresusing discounting of future benefits, as well as ongoing costs. since theoccurrence, magnitude, and timing of future disasters are uncertain, appropriate discount rates may have to be quite high, so that results adequately reflect the intuition of the participants and funders of disastermitigation expenses. while economic cost estimates of disaster impactsare never precise, they do provide orderofmagnitude estimates neededto allow projects and proposals to be ranked.estimation of the savings resulting from reduced impact due to mitigation efforts is particularly difficult. many it benefits will be due tobeing able to respond more rapidly. developing models on how fasterresponse can reduce eventual costs is a substantial, but interesting, challenging, and rewarding task. an actual economic quantification of thecost of disaster mitigation versus the benefits obtained could be a fruitfularea for research.use of a costbenefit modelany recommendation for new and increased outlays must be accompanied by a quantification of their benefits. while costs are easy to quantify, the benefits of disaster mitigation are hard to quantify, but a reasonimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.improving acquisition and adoption of it75able attempt is required. it is expected that the costs of improving thetechnology available for disaster mitigation will be offset by substantialbenefits accruing to the country. the most important of these benefitscannot be directly quantified, since they represent the human dimension:reduction of suffering, preservation of family stability, and prevention oflosses of items of purely personal value. other benefits of disaster mitigation can and should be quantified.the low frequency of major disasters greatly reduces the prioritiesthat local planners, faced with many shortterm needs, actually assign toaccumulating and maintaining the resources that are adequate for dealingwith disasters. while some supplies can be stockpiled for decades, itbecomes obsolescent much faster and requires an ongoing infusion offunds. in the commercial world, a spending rate of 15 percent of the initialand upgrade investments is expected. costs are reduced when obsoletesystems are taken out of service. for many systems, the military tends tospend less annually but is then faced with huge, wholesale replacementcosts every 12 years and has an inadequate system for more than half ofthat period.readiness for mitigating disasters requires a modest but steady investment in technology. the total benefits are due to cost reduction thatoccur at unpredictable times and are of unpredictable magnitude. major,quantifiable benefits are due to infrequent events. for an individualcounty, the investment in disastermitigation technologies appears to represent an instantaneous expense, sometimes aided by state or federalgrants. maintenance costs are indifferent budgets and are hard to assess.technology evaluationthe decentralized nature of disaster management, spread across thousands of agenciesñfrom the smallest volunteer fire department, to sophisticated urban police departments, to state, regional, and federal agenciesñpresents particular problems for effective technology evaluation anddiffusion. today, many managers responsible for the acquisition of technology for public safety and emergency management are, quite understandably, unable to keepupto date with the volume of technology andchoices available. managers often rely on vendors to tell them what theyneed and have to base decisions largely on the oftenconflicting òadviceóof various vendors.professional conferences, workshops, and other meetings held bypublic safety and emergency management associations are one mechanism for facilitating diffusion of the latest technology. it capabilities, mostnotably the internet, may prove useful as well by providing a conduit forsharing and discussing information about what works.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.76improving disaster managementmore systematic approaches to evaluation would likely yield deeperand broader technology adoption over the long term. one option is tomake use of formal mechanisms for providing unbiased evaluations andguidanceña sort of consumer reports for disaster managers. the militaryõsexperience with technology demonstrations, described in the next section, may provide one model for this type of òclearinghouseó approach.important differences exist between the defense and disaster management contexts regarding technology evaluation. for instance, the militaryhas a somewhatwelldefined acquisition chain that flows from initialideas to deployment agencies. in civilian disaster management, development and procurement are far more decentralized. decentralization introduces handoff issues for successfully demonstrated technology. still,adapting the lessons of military technology transfer to civilian disastermanagement yields at least two insights.the first insight is that technology demonstration will be successful tothe extent that more knowledgeable technology adopters are available forexperimentation. the next two sectionsñon processes that bring technology developers and practitioners together and on building capacity at theintersection of it and disaster managementñdiscuss mechanisms andexamples for growing the capacity of practitioners as knowledgeable technology adopters.a second insight is the importance of an honest broker serving as aneutral technology clearinghouse that can help provide the expertise toidentify and evaluate technology. there are a few examples, from whichothers have successfully learned, where local and state agencies havetaken the lead in demonstrating the viability of a technology. some states(e.g., south dakota and indiana2) have taken on this role, identifying andevaluating technology, infrastructure, and services, and in several casesproviding one or more of these to local agencies.privatesector integration centers aimed at bringing together diversetechnologies can have value in getting vendors to make their productswork with those of other vendors. but, they are necessarily designed topromote both their particular partnerõs products and their own consulting and integration services. these vendordriven efforts will likely fallshort of being truly neutral.one option for achieving the neutrality of an honest broker to vettechnology intended for disaster management is used for similar reasonsin other government mission areas. it is the federally funded research2based on the testimony of otto doll, bureau of information technology, state of southdakota, and dave smith, indiana integrated public safety commission, at the committeeõsjune 2005 workshop.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of

meetspecific longterm technical needs. ffrdcs typically assist governmentagencies with scientific research and analysis, systems development, andsystems acquisition. they draw together expertise and perspectives fromgovernment, industry, and academia to address complex technical issues.an ffrdc for disaster management would not have any operationalresponsibilities. rather, it would serve the disaster management community by identifying, developing, and assessing technologies and conceptsof operation for using those technologies.processes that bring technologydevelopers and practitioners togetheran iterative development process goes hand in hand with an acquisition process which assumes that technologies and organizational processes will coevolve. coordinating technological advances and organizational process changes requires new knowledge and skills on the part ofboth practitioners and technology developers and new relationships between them. such coordination depends on practitioners and developersgaining a better understanding of one anotherõs methods and on mechanisms that maintain dialogue between them in order to identify promising technologies, define appropriate uses for them, and evaluate and disseminate the outcomes.the department of defense has a broad set of programs aimed atbringing together technology developers and users, speeding innovation,and transitioning it into use in the field. one notable model with considerable applicability to disaster management is the advanced concepttechnology demonstration (actd) model,3 which also pays particularattention to the interplay between technology and organization. an actdis used at the phase where promising technologies have been developedtogether with a vision of how they could be used. an actd provides aframework in which to assemble a group that is willing to be an earlyadopter and a context into which the technology can be inserted andevaluated. a wellrun actd includes a phase where the system, organization, and technology are all analyzed together, and modifications toeach are identified and implemented.a particular strength of the actd approach is that it recognizes that3a description of the goals of an actd is available at http://www.acq.osd.mil/actd/transit.htm.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.78improving disaster managementit is not enough to build the technology. one needs to analyze the organization and look at how processes are going to change as a result of havingthe technology. the idea is to simultaneously develop requirements fororganizational change and adaptations of technology to fit that.to use the actd approach effectively, patience is required. otherwise, the design phase may be overly compressed to the detriment of theultimate product. promising innovations may wither while waiting to beadopted, or problems identified during the acquisition phase may resultin a technologyõs being abandoned before researchers are able to findsolutions.building capacity at the intersection of it anddisaster managementthe committee heard from state and local agencies that one of themajor barriers to advancing practice and adoption of technology was alack of resources to allow staff time for ongoing development of technicalexpertise. yet, without the inhouse development of technology expertiseable to draw on external resources (such as centers of excellence), adoption of technology will continue to lag and is unlikely to be optimallyimplemented when adopted.the interdependence of technology and practice means that developing a cadre of experts at the intersection of disaster management and it islikely to yield significant payoffs. expanding the human assets availableinvolves both the promotion of crossfertilization between the technologyand practitioner communities and the promotion of a culture of innovation in both. such a cadre of people will be more astute at translating userrequirements to technical need, and will serve as a selfreinforcing feedback mechanism between technology advances and disaster managementpractices.a number of mechanisms could contribute to increasing human capital along these lines. these include both mechanisms for fostering innovative environments wherever possible and mechanisms for disseminatingtheir results elsewhere. for example, programs could be established tosupport fellowships, field tests and other experiments, and training andeducational activities. also, programs that incorporate both disaster andit expertise could be funded to analyze the performance of systems aftera disaster.federal grants could support creation of expertise within state andlocal agencies by, for instance, sending people from public safety agenciesto regional centers for training and to interact with technology expertsand other practitioners to stay abreast of the latest developments in bothpractice and technology.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of

perceived economies of scale are driving many disastermanagers to move from being owneroperators of their it and communications to being customers of contractors and service providers. evenwhere public safety and emergency management agencies retain ownership of their it and communications assets, they increasingly have become reliant on vendors for information on what is technically possibleand worthwhile.formal acquisition and management processes are generally designedto enforce appropriate procurement standards. however, they also runthe risk of filtering out many useful, original ideas and possible contributions from outsiders and can present insurmountable obstacles to theacceptance of new technologies, unless and until they have been converted into profitable commercial products. even when emerging capabilities are tracked and assessed, traditional design and acquisition methods are illsuited to keep pace with accelerating shifts in technology.4 asdiscussed below, there are a number of opportunities to broaden the set ofusers that participate in the shaping, development, and evolution of itsystems.the recent movement of open source software and standards development is one recent expression of this voluntary impulse. (see box 3.1for background on open source software and open standards.) although some of the resistance to the use of open source software indisaster management might ultimately be traceable to active oppositionby commercial vendors, there are also structural obstacles to noncommercial innovation within disaster agencies. this is regrettable, sincemany technical innovations begin as noncommercial experiments, thoughonly a relatively few survive the road to commercialization. despite thisresistance, there are some examples of how the open source software/open standard development model has been applied to disaster management. (see box 3.2 for one such example.)several strategies are available for extracting the most valuable itemsfrom the noncommercial offerings of the volunteer and open sourcecommunities:¥organized experimentation and evaluation of noncommercial andprecommercial technology.

offering user feedback andreview to noncommercial development projects.¥use of selected noncommercial advisers as independent sourcesof information and reviewing it and communication plans under theauspices of an advisory organization.judged on the merits of their results, open source software/openstandards developers could become valuable members of the disasterbox 3.1open source software and open standardsopen source software and open standards are two aspects of a cooperativeapproach to information technology that has deep roots in the internet. opensource refers to the internal programmingñthe source codeñof an application. intraditional proprietary software, the secrecy of the source code is the foundation ofits commercial value. access to source code is restricted, and details of its operation are disclosed only in general terms. open source software, on the other hand,is freely published and generally visible. while some financial value can be recovered in fees for ancillary services (e.g., consulting and sales of reference books),the chief reward for the creation of open source software accrues to the reputationof the programmer or programmers who contribute to its creation.although much open source software is the work of individual programmersor small, discrete teams, the òreputation economyó of open source software development lends itself to the formation of large ad hoc collaborations, often involvingdevelopers widely distributed geographically and interacting via the internet, competing for recognition of the quality of their contributions instead of for commercialequity.the open source approach has produced some of the worldõs most popularsoftware, such as the widely used apache web server program and the linuxcomputer operating system. proponents of open source software argue that ittends to be more secure (since security weaknesses cannot be hidden within proprietary programming) and more flexible (since it can be readily customized) atlower costs than commercial software products. they suggest that the lack of financial constraints leads to software that is òproblemoriented rather than profitorientedó and that the lack of a commercial incentive to lock in customers to aparticular program helps preserve market efficiencies over time.critics of open source software dispute the costeffectiveness of such

is a common estimate of maintenance costs). theyalso warn that the design of open source software may reflect the interests of thedevelopers more than the needs of the users.open standards, by contrast, are blind to the internal composition or economics of any particular program or device. open standards specify certain externalbehaviors of a program or device in order to ensure interoperability among variousimplementations. open standards may describe file formats, communication protocols, or equipment configurations. they are deemed òopenó to the extent thatthey are published so that products and applications can implement them withoutlicensing or other costs.arguably the most successful open standards effort to date has been theinternet itself. by publishing a collection of nonproprietary technical standards(the internet protocols) for unencumbered use, the creators of the internet enableddata exchange among diverse computer systems and software packages. as aresult, the data and functionality available on any internetconnected computernow vastly exceed the usefulness of that same computer standing alone.the open standards movement and the open source community share anemphasis on collaboration and cooperation as sources of value. this ònetworkeconomicsó view sees value as the product of connectivity among numerous entities, as opposed to the more traditional view that value is a function of scarcity.(the classic illustration of the former line of thought is that the value of the first faxmachine was nothing until there was a second one. and the more fax machinesthere were in the world, the more valuable each of them became.)open source software and open standards are not so much challenges totraditional commercial approaches as they are extensions and supplements thattake advantage of voluntary collaboration and cooperation, especially in lowfrequency, highrisk, and highuncertainty applications where commercial incentivesalone may not yield needed results.management community. successful examples of applying this model inother areas range from widely used programming languages and operating systems to the internet. they have a

fill this role. however, there is a tremendous communitybuilding opportunity if the role is filled by an organization that hasan educational component, has systems development and support skills,and is rooted in the practitioner communities. the ideal structure wouldbe one where training of both it developers and technologysavvypractioners is performed in an environment that includes testbed technology innovations and where the practitioner community and it development community could learn from each other, providing a positive feedback loop for the development of it solutions grounded in practicalrealities.training and the importance of routine usedisaster managers emphasize the importance of technology beingused on a routine basis by practitioners if it is to be used effectively, or atall, during a disaster event. understandably, practitioners turn to thethings they trust and are most familiar with, especially in the highstresssituation of disaster response. training is important, but it often occursonly once, shortly after a technology is introduced. technology that sitsidle until the onset of an event will likely remain unused. the committeeheard of instances where responders did not know or remember wherethe technology was or how to access it when it was eventually needed.frequent training is also necessary because the technology itself oftenchanges rapidly.in each of the areas of disaster management activity, most of theorganizations and personnel (e.g., law enforcement, firefighting, emergency medical treatment, sea patrol and rescue) involved have regulardaytoday responsibilities and activities different in kind and in magnitude from major disaster operations. training and equipment providedfor disaster responsibilities may not be optimum for daytoday activities,so that compromises or separate parallel training and equipment may benecessary. full consideration of cost, complexity, and other issues associated with this problem are such that implementation is difficult.training programs are expensive and take critical resources out ofservice for the duration of the training. it is often logistically difficult toarrange training for huge public safety organizations, with training sometimes spread over many months. the less relevant the lessons are to theirdaily tasks, the less likely practitioners are to retain lessons from thetraining. yet, it developed for disaster management is frequently designed for use only during major events, and using it effectively requiresspecial knowledge or familiarity based on experience

disasters.one partial solution is to seek technology that has the broadest possible application in daily operations, with smooth transition (from a userõsperspective) to functionality required only in handling disaster events.the switch over to disaster operations should be as seamless as possible.as an example of what to avoid, the committee saw an operations centerduring a site visit where two separate software applications with overlapping functionality coexisted; one application was used during routineoperations, the other only in disaster situations. the application used on adaily basis was widely and effectively used. the application with additional specialized disaster functionality was ill understood by all but afew personnel.leveraging ònonofficialó information technologyalthough disaster management is typically associated with government response agencies, the true boundaries of the disaster managementcommunity are difficult to draw. nongovernmental organizations of various kinds, government agencies not normally concerned with disasters orpublic safety, trained volunteers and emergent ones (especially within thevictim population itself)ñall these are active participants in disaster management. private voluntary organizations play important roles in disasterresponse and recovery activities, including the distribution of food, water, and other supplies and the provision of shelter. amateur radio operators have long played a role in disaster communications and have beenformally incorporated into disaster communications planning and procedures. moreover, in a disaster, many individuals and organizations willstep forward as volunteers. some will be those who happen to be presentat the scene of a disaster. (for example, a number of live rescues after anearthquake are performed by bystanders, not official responders.)many volunteers prove to be crucial contributors to a disaster response and possess resources or expertise not otherwise available. others6this is one of the conclusions of sharon dawes, thomas birkland, giri kumar tayi, andcarrie a. schneider, information, technology, and

are they responders or victims? are their motives altruistic, selfish, or even criminal? are they actually who they say they are? nor are the priorities ofvolunteers necessarily well aligned with those of officials. as a result,volunteers and their contributions to official agencies are generally filtered through coordinators and programs that act to limit their impact onthe agenciesõ official programs.recent it advances offer new ways for volunteers to contribute todisaster response and recovery efforts. for example, the following are justa few of the many volunteer activities in the

be tried out have led to the creation ofmany novel communications mechanisms that have applications for disaster management. the success of technologies like googleõs search engine, wikipedia, blogs, and google maps is evidence that informationtechnologies that provide userdriven information access are powerfulenablers.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness,

preauthorized preformatted reporting and because usersare presented with multiple sources providing data on any query. at thesame time, users are forced to sift, evaluate, and decide what informationis helpful. and old problems, such as conflicting and redundant efforts,unclear motivations, lack of accountability, inaccurate information, anddiffering priorities are all present.problems or not, it can be safely assumed that future disasters willbring about the spontaneous creation of similar nonofficial uses of itñand most likely completely novel ones as well. the obvious potentialvalue of these initiatives to various aspects of disaster response and recovery activities coupled with the potential for problems should drivedisaster managers to seek constructive ways to incorporate them intodisaster management practice whenever feasible and appropriate. careful study should be undertaken with the goal of making iterative improvements in leveraging these nonofficial, emergent activities so thatthey eventually become part of the standard inventory of techniques andprocedures used to deal with disasters.effectively usingcommercial communicatcions servicescommercial communications services offer potentially large cost savings over dedicated systems but raise questions as to whether stringentcapacity and reliability requirements can be met. striking the right balance in the face of market forces that drive commercial service providerswill require careful and ongoing evaluation by public safety agencies.public safety agencies maintain extensive infrastructure independentof the commercial infrastructure available to the general public. there area number of important reasons for this. the national task force oninteroperability (ntfi) guide for public safety officials òwhy canõt wetalk?ó asks the question, òwhy canõt they just use cell phones?ó7 it answers the question by noting that responding to disaster situations, whereevery second counts, requires reliable, dedicated equipment. public safetyofficials cannot depend on commercial systems that can be overloadedand unavailable; experience has shown that these systems are often themost unreliable during critical incidents when public demand over7national task force on interoperability, òwhy canõt we talk?: working together tobridge the communications gap to save lives: a

requirementsó for optimal public safety communication systems as including dedicated channels with priority access,reliable onetomany broadcast capability, highly reliable and redundantnetworks, the best possible coverage within a geographic area, and equipment designed for quick responseñin short, something officials can control and count on.and yet, the use of commercial infrastructure by first responders andpublic safety officials is increasing. this is happening for several reasons.first, commercial infrastructure is much less expensive than dedicated,purposebuilt public safety communications infrastructure. second, it isoften what is at hand during an incident. third, it helps achieve resilienceby provided redundancy and diversity, potentially at relatively low costs.(see the detailed discussion on redundancy and diversity to achieve resilience later in this chapter.) efforts, both formal and informal, are underway to make additional use of commercial services. commercial infrastructure used today for disaster management includes the following:¥cellular voice networks,¥cellular data networks for mobile data terminals (such as those inpolice cars and ambulances),¥cellular data networks for text messaging and email services,¥satellite phone networks,¥ad hoc wireless networks,¥municipal wireless networks (some of these are dedicated networks for public safety personnel),¥traffic management systems,¥aerial photo systems,¥radio over ip systems,¥cable/public television broadcasting systems,¥video monitoring and conferencing systems,¥paging systems,¥telephone bridges,¥internet services, including (but not limited to) voice over ip,¥remote hosted incident management services (e.g., eteam,webeoc), and¥commercial imagery satellites and image databases.commercial hardware, software, and network services are subject tointense competitive price pressure. maintaining profitability entails a vigorous effort by the providers to minimize costs. but many of the stepsavailable to control costsñreduction of component count, use of the leastexpensive components available, avoidance of unused òoverheadó capacimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.88improving disaster managementity, and the likeñcan directly reduce the resilience of the product when itis used in unusual circumstances.for example, unused capacity is expensive for shared telecommunications systems such as the public telephone network, cellular phones,and satellite systems. system operators conduct careful statistical studiesto estimate the level of capacity needed to satisfy most of their customersunder most circumstances. any capacity in excess of that is, from a business perspective, wasted, and operators have a fiduciary duty to avoidsuch waste. unfortunately, this means that during exceptional surges intraffic, as occur during disasters and even on holidays and during certainsporting and cultural events, the available network capacity is exceededand service becomes unreliable. (this economic phenomenon is sometimes obscured by memories of successful use during previous disasters,when the system in question was new and not yet fully loaded to profitability.)design principlesa high degree of reliance on turnkey systems has meant that disastermanagement organizations have not had to pay a great deal of attentionto the underlying design issues that ultimately affect the functionality oftheir it systems. today, pervasive networking and the increasing importance of offtheshelf technologies make it possible for organizations toassemble a greater portion of their disaster management systems fromcomponents provided by different vendors. doing so successfully willrequire that those organizations take on more responsibility for the design of those systems. in the course of its work, the committee has identified four system design principles that have particular importance fordisaster management systems:¥build emergency management systems for effective scaling from routineto disaster operation. system designs that feature wrenching and riskladentransitions between daily operational mode and òdisasteró mode canmake bad situations worse. all system components should be used regularly, even if not at full scale, by the people who will need them in adisaster. familiarity smoothes transitions from routine to disaster operations. indeed, people tend to avoid or are ineffective with the unfamiliar.¥exploit redundancy and diversity to achieve resilience. improving overall resilience can be achieved using many different techniques in combination. one approach is to òhardenó systems, designing them to higheroperational standards than those typically applied to commercial servicesand technology. a valuable alternative, which offers both the promise ofimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.improving acquisition and adoption of it89improved performance and lower cost, is to exploit redundancy and diversity to improve the overall resilience of an it system.¥design systems with flexibility, composability, and interoperability ascore guiding principles. each of these characteristics has important, wideranging implications for system design. systems that place a premium onflexibility and agility lend themselves to the sorts of ad hoc use that oftenis needed in a disaster. systems composed of standard components willimprove the ability to evolve them incrementally and reduce reliance onany single vendor. systems with designedin interoperability pointsgreatly facilitate interoperation with other systems.¥distinguish between the user interface and the underlying technologiesused to deliver a capability. a particular user experience and the particulartechnologies used to deliver it need not be the same. consider, for example, that first responder radios encapsulate multiple attributesñpushtotalk, the form factor of the handset and microphone, and pushtotalkcommunications within defined groupsñthat could be unbundled andrepackaged for more effective use. similarly, future handheld communications devices might employ cell phone technology (not commercial cellphones themselves) but with appropriate adaptations (in durability, formfactor, or frequency) that meet disaster management requirements yetleverage lowercost commercial technology.each of these principles is discussed in more detail below.effective scaling from routine to disaster operationdisasters are sufficiently different from daytoday life events to beperceived as a completely separate mode of operations involving different organizational structures and priorities, different attitudes and skills,different methods, and different technologies. this impression is reinforced by a collection of binary words and concepts: disasters are òdeclared,ó emergency plans and facilities are òactivated,ó resources are òmobilizedó and then later òdemobilized.óyet this clearcut distinction between òdisaster modeó and normaloperations is in some sense a matter of administrative convenience. actual disasters vary enormously both in scale and quality. some, such asearthquakes, terrorist explosions, and electrical blackouts, come on suddenly and with a minimum of warning. others, such as riverine floods,hurricanes, and food shortages, come on relatively gradually. some, suchas infectious disease epidemics and bioterrorism attacks, might actuallybe in progress for some time before being recognized. by the same token,some disasters conclude quickly, allowing a rapid shift from responseimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.90improving disaster managementinto recovery, while others persist for longer and sometimes unpredictable periods. and while the generalized incident command functions ofcommand, operations, plans, logistics, and finance are generic and applicable to all hazards, the specific makeup and activities of each functioncan vary considerably depending on the nature, scope, and phase of theparticular event.in addition to the challenge of matching the response to the situation,these broad ranges of possibilities create challenges for managing thetransition into and back out of òdisaster mode.ó many problems in disaster response may be artifacts of these transition challenges, especially asregards interpersonal and interorganizational communication and coordination. differences in situational awareness and assessment and resulting differences in the timing and degree of òactivationó between organizations and individuals can lead to procedural and perceptual disconnectsand to falsely calibrated expectations. for example, in 1991 californiaregional emergency management personnel near a major urban wildfireexperienced difficulty in mobilizing their headquarters to respond to resource requests. the more distant headquarters had not yet received tactical and media reports of the extent and rapid growth of the blaze andthus had not yet fully activated.this tendency toward representation errors and òmode bindingó maybe exacerbated by the tendency to focus on worstcase scenarios in planning and exercises. the tacit assumption that a worstcase scenario willexercise all emergency management functions overlooks the problemsinherent in transitions and the ambiguities of borderline situations thatmay or may not turn out to be disasters or that are evaluated differentlyby different response entities.thoughtful use of it could do a great deal to mitigate the problem oftransitions, largely by reframing occasional disaster activities as continualprocesses that can be scaled up or down without creating discontinuities.at least four potential benefits could be realized.first, the interconnection of emergency management applicationsusing shared data standards could permit activities such as situation reporting and resource management to be turned into continual òflowóprocesses rather than òbatchó activities based on paperbased documentoriented systems. this conversion could reduce the time delays and theunintended synchronization of reports, requests, and orders inherent infixed reporting cycles. it could also permit more rapid and precise detection of trends and conditions by allowing observations to be shared at arate suited to the phenomena observed rather than one dictated by a fixedreporting schedule.second, a continually updated shared knowledge base, in the form ofa òcommon operating picture,ó could reduce various difficulties that canimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.improving acquisition and adoption of it91result from different entities having different editions of situation andresource reports at a single point in time.third, the greater òvirtualizationó of emergency management processes using network technologies could reduce the impact of disasters ondaytoday operations by allowing many organizations and individualsto participate in the emergency information system from their regularworkplaces. it also allows for more phased relocation to emergency facilities, thus reducing the vulnerability of the emergency management system that can result when all participants are in transit at the same time.finally, in addition to reducing the necessary size of physical emergency operation centers, greater virtualization might also permit a moregradual activation of emergency procedures, one that can be more closelymatched to the particular òcurveó of a particular disaster. this couldreduce both the disruption and missteps associated with allatonce activations and the tardy activations that sometimes result from hesitance totake the disruptive and expensive step of dislocating large numbers ofkey personnel.one key to obtaining each of these benefits would be to abandoncontingent òin case of disaster, break glassó systems and procedures infavor of an òalways onó approach enabled by modern it and communications. it is also critical to understand the degree to which it can effectivelycomplement, support, and substitute for facetoface communications.redundancy and diversity to achieve resilienceone of the fundamental dynamics of disaster management is thetradeoff between efficiency and resilience. at a technical level, communication can be disrupted by many factors, such as the following: physicaldestruction of equipment or infrastructure (e.g., towers, cables, and substations), loss of power, interoperability problems, and environmentalfactors (e.g., obstacles for wireless). hardening devices and infrastructureis an obvious way to reduce failures of equipment and infrastructure andreduce the chances of power loss. while it is not economically feasible toharden all critical equipment, improvements are certainly possible. forexample, it should be possible to develop tools to analyze the robustnessof the communication infrastructure in certain disaster scenarios and toapply resources optimally to harden those at greatest risk.while hardening equipment and infrastructure continues to offer potential for improvements, other means of achieving resilience in it systems for disaster management are often discounted or overlooked. redundancy and diversity are two wellknown techniques for building resilient(reliable, robust) it systems.redundancy can be provided inside a network that uses a specificimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.92improving disaster managementtechnologyñfor example, by building additional relay stations or accesspoints into the infrastructure. this would make it possible to route trafficover alternate paths if some components fail. the ability to establish parallel redundant networks quickly can reduce down time. two examplesare (1) parallel wireless networks based on commercial technology and(2) cellularonwheels (cow)ñmovable cellular sites with satellitebackhaul to establish cellular bubbles using dedicated spectrum.8 it isnecessary to plan for such deployments in advance. equipment must beavailable, spectrum must be allocated, and people must be trained. also,organizational support must be created (e.g., directory services).technological diversity in the basic infrastructure for all organizations (including large and small businesses, government agencies, andcommunity organizations) would reduce the impact of disasters.9 a related risk is that a technology monoculture, in which a technical attack ina single operating system or other piece of software could cripple response activities across the board. indeed, integrating disaster planningefforts across private and public it systems that embrace diversity andredundancy could lead to significant improvements in the overall reliability of information and communications capabilities in the event of adisaster.as discussed earlier in this chapter, one important opportunity forachieving better resilience is by using commercial technology and services. commercial technologies offer significant opportunities for bothbetter redundancy and increased diversity. two examples of this opportunity are cellular and wireless networking technologies. nearly everyone uses cell phones on a daily basis, so they will naturally continue touse them during a disaster. besides traditional voice calls, cell phones alsoincreasingly support other communications capabilitiesñfor example,pushtotalk, text messaging, web access, and instant messagingñall ofwhich may be useful and familiar. wireless networking is also becomingubiquitous in populated areas and is supported on multiple mobile de8cows have been deployed for wilderness firefighting, and qualcomm deployed animprovised system that included movable

relativelyinexpensive. these characteristics naturally lead to it capabilities that areboth redundant and diverse.flexibility, composability, and interoperability ascore guiding principlessystems designed to exhibit the characteristics of flexibility, composability, and interoperability as core guiding principles can producemany longterm improvements with wideranging implications for theeffectiveness of it use for disaster management. each of these characteristics has important implications for system design.almost by definition, one cannot anticipate every contingency thatmust be dealt with in a disaster. in disaster management, where information channels can be interrupted and informal channels established without official sanction, developing and encouraging these characteristics areespecially important, though often counter to the urge for control.this observation suggests favoring composed systems consistingof diverse components over turnkey, integrated solutions. composingsystems from diverse (standard) components allows selection of bestofbreed solutions, enables federated solutions made up of diverse technologies with carefully chosen operational boundaries at which interoperability can be managed, and provides greater overall robustness throughdiversity.another important design principle is to build systems assuming future needs for interoperation with other systems. by constructing systemsusing layered architectures with potential points of interoperation designed in from the beginning (e.g., by designing to established standards),systems can be made interoperable without requiring technological monocultures.composability offers further advantages. the shortterm economiesattributed to lockstep standardization can be substantially offset by theimproved marketplace power of users who are not locked in to a particular vendorõs wares but instead obtain the benefits of continued competition for their business. the costs of technological diversity are real, but soare the benefits. this is true in nondisaster systems and even more so indisaster management systems where resilience is more important thanefficiency. the diverse agencies responsible for responding to disastersand for acquiring technology to do so should embrace the natural tendency toward heterogeneity that this organizational reality engenders.the challenge is to work with other agencies to standardize the rightthings.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.94improving disaster managementanother driver of purposebuilt proprietary systems involves currentefforts to eliminate technological stovepipes and singleagency systemsthat greatly hamper effective, interoperable communication on the scalenecessary during a disaster. this is an important goal given the significant and ongoing problems with interoperability already discussed inchapters 1 and 2. these systems improve interoperability but generallydo so by moving the stovepipes to a higher organizational level (e.g.,multiple police departments are integrated into a statewide police communication system, or municipal police and firefighting communicationsystems are integrated within a municipality or region), but boundarieswill remain (e.g., police and fire fighters cannot communicate, or publicsafety agencies across jurisdictions cannot communicate). federated solutions made up of diverse technologies and platforms could be implemented without the technological and operational risks associated withpurposebuilt, integrated solutionsñand still provide interoperability, aslong as interoperability points are designed into the system.mobile phone companies have managed a major technology generation change about once every 10 years. is this an argument for a monolithic system or a federated system? mobile networks generally consist ofmonolithic and noninteroperable technology at the wireless interface.however, mobile phones have a clear interoperability point, the telephonenetwork (and more recently the internet). operators may make technology changes (large and small) internally to their network while continuing to maintain an interface to the interoperability point. this is, in fact,why cellular networks built on global system for mobile communication(gsm) technology can interoperate with code division multiple access(cdma)based networks. in the same way, different agencies might havedifferent and incompatible networks but maintain an interoperabilitypoint with other agenciesõ networks.even within integrated, allinone systems, substantial value fromtechnological diversity can be achieved by allowing for integration ofdiverse components built with standard interfaces rather than buildingendtoend proprietary systems. systems that have taken the trouble tomeet the challenges of a diverse technology base at any one point in timeare also òfutureproofedó against technological change. new componentsbecome just additional instances of diversity, allowing incremental system upgrades that can leverage the latest technology advances, ratherthan introducing dilemmas requiring fundamental and potentially disruptive òforklift upgradesó or lost opportunities for improving effectiveness. that same flexibility makes diverse systems more agile in the faceof sudden change. mergers, relocations, and major changes in scale arecharacteristic of daytoday operations as much as of disasters, and adiversitytolerant approach to technology can facilitate them all.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.improving acquisition and adoption of it95 the user interface and theunderlying technologies to deliver a capabilitymany familiar information and communication technologies are bestknown by the various controls, displays, sounds, or other sensory experiences they present to the user. the familiar package of a public safetyresponderõs portable twoway radio stands, in many peopleõs minds, forthe whole infrastructure of frequencies, repeaters, and towers of whichthe radios are the outward and visible sign. first responder radios encapsulate multiple attributesñpushtotalk capability, the form factor of thehandset and microphone, and communications within defined groupsñthat could be unbundled and repackaged for more effective use. handheldcommunications devices might employ cell phone technology but withadaptations (in durability, form factor, or frequency).but the association of the òuser interfaceó with the underlying infrastructure is not nearly as fixed as in the past, and grows less so every year.pushtotalk operation has, for example, been added to cell phone systems. similarly, the internet connects twoway radio networks and telephone calls, while telephones send emails and images to computers overthe internet. television transmitters broadcast data, while tv programsare òstreamedó over data connections. the longheralded òdigital convergenceó of various communications and computing platforms has arrived,and in arriving has demolished many of the traditional connections between how a communications capability is embodied in a user interfaceand the underlying infrastructure used to deliver it. this is creating nosmall degree of confusion in procurement, regulation, and managementof it systems.too often, wouldbe innovators have been hamstrung by regulationsor procedures that confuse the user interface with the underlying infrastructure. however, the opportunities created by tearing down the wallsbetween systems are much greater than the costs. single devices can beused to replace multiple devices, thus cutting costs and simplifying thework of first responders and emergency managers alike. different systems can be interconnected in unforeseen and expedient ways, creatingnew capabilities such as circumventing damaged infrastructure.the conflation of interface device (e.g., computer, phone) and infrastructure (e.g., the network hardware and networking protocols) alsoleads to the mistaken presumption that a diversity of communicationsystems must present huge challenges for the users to learn and effectively operate in a diverse technology environment. however, a variety offamiliar as well as novel interface devices could coexist while still enabling interoperation and communication between systemsñeven wherethe underlying networks are vastly different. likewise, users could beimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.96improving disaster managementprovided with a single, consistent interface that nonetheless utilizes morethan one discovery, routing, and transport regime. the underlying infrastructure can hide the technological òglueó necessary to communicatebetween systems. either way, interface device choices should be drivenby how best to ease training and promote familiarity through routine use,and should be largely independent of decisions about the underlyinginfrastructure.an awareness of the difference between these two distinct layersof technology and a thorough understanding of how they can be mosteffectively coupled with each other, depending on system requirements,is a critical skill for builders and managers of disaster management itsystems.the technology pipelinethe current state of the art in technology and level of technologyadoption differs considerably across the capabilities discussed in chapters 2 and 4. these differences in terms of readiness can be usefullythought of in terms of a technology pipeline. where a given capability isin the technology pipeline affects the type of investment needed to advance it toward use in practice and the amount of time before a payoff canbe expected. a technology investment process to produce a steady streamof improvements for incorporation of it in disaster management shouldinclude a detailed assessment of where technologies are in the pipeline.investments are most likely to provide continuous improvements whenbalanced across the spectrum of possibilitiesñfrom adoption, adaptation,and development to applied research and general research. aroadmapping process, described in the following section, is a tool thatcould help guide such investments.one way of dividing up the stages in the technology pipeline is thefollowing:¥adoptionñtechnology available today requiring efforts to overcome adoption barriers. some it technology is already available but has not beenwidely (though possibly partially) adopted by the public safety or disaster management communities that could benefit from it. such technologydoes not require significant further adaptation, development, or research.there are many reasons that such technology has not been adopted, including cost, lack of awareness or training, and resistance to change.nonetheless, adoption of these technologies can have immediate impacton attaining important goals for the use of it for disaster management.the time to realize benefits from these technologies is limited chiefly bythe time necessary to overcome the barriers to adoption, which will varyimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.improving acquisition and adoption of it97by organization and the nature of the barriers to be overcome. thesebarriers may include the time to secure the investment and to make theappropriate connection between that investment and the fully discountednet present value of the savings that the investment will accrue. advancesin general data processing, storage, communication, display, and software technologies will continue to make components of it systems lessexpensive and more capable with timeñaiding the adoption process. (examples of technologies in this category and described in chapter 4 include radiofrequency identification (rfid) for resource tracking and logistics; computermediated exercises; reverse 911 capability, i.e., twowayemergency reporting; and portable unmanned aerial vehicles and robots.)¥adaptationñtechnology on the horizon and ready for transfer to disastermanagement practice. effective systems to serve disaster management maybe assembled by combining and adapting available commodity components. it systems are mainly built using hardware that is available off theshelf and adapted using offtheshelf software components. some hardware componentsñsuch as personal computers and disk drivesñhavebecome commodities. commodity hardware benefits from significanteconomies of scale, so that the hardware cost of a cell phone is roughlyonetenth that of a police handheld radio. part of the cost differential isdue to specialized functionality and ruggedness requirements, but a significant portion of the difference comes from much higher productionvolumes. adapting commodity hardware to disaster management (in contrast to developing wholly novel hardware) could significantly lower costdue to specialized requirements. software exhibits more flexibility. manysoftware and webbased applications are expressly designed to allowcustomization for specific uses. some useful software exists that has beendeveloped in an open and freely shared environment that lends itself toadaptation and customization. in such an environment, investment canbe distributed, often close to the end users, making it possible for usersand vendors to adapt many existing it technologies to disaster management readily and rapidly. useful results can be obtained on time scalesmeasured in months. (examples of technologies in this category and described in chapter 4 are commercial collaboration software and file sharing, online resource directories, multiple input/multiple output wirelesssystems, integrated ad hoc data collection tools (blogs/wikis), and mobilecellular infrastructure.)¥developmentñtechnology on the horizon and development needed foruse in disaster management. for some requirements the technology anddesign principles are fairly well understood, but existing technology issimply not adequate for disaster management. a concerted effort is required to develop significant software, hardware, and organizationalstructures to take advantage of them. in this case, a requestforproposalsimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.98improving disaster managementprocess can be used to solicit capable organizations to deliver a productthat implements the desired technology. development time depends onproject complexity, but useful results can often be obtained within a year.(examples of technologies in this category and described in chapter 4 arevolunteer mobilization systems, eventreplay tools, and intelligent adaptive planning tools.)¥applied researchñissues requiring disastermanagementspecific research. there remain some difficult issues in disaster management forwhich solutions are not at handñfor example, reliable radio communications inside buildings or rubble. research aimed specifically at improvingdisaster management could be conducted by university, commercial, andgovernment laboratories, and even volunteer relief agencies such as thered cross. this type of activity is managed and directed within the government by agencies such as the national science foundation, the department of homeland security (dhs), the national institutes of health,and by defenserelated organizations such as the defense advanced research projects agency and the service research laboratories. support forsmaller companies is given through small business innovation researchand small business technology transfer programs administered by manyof the above agencies. because of the nature of disaster management andthe types of challenges that the community faces, disastermanagementrelated it research is becoming increasingly broad and interdisciplinary(see box 3.3 for a discussion of the challenges of interdisciplinary research), involving contributions from multiple technical and social science fields. fully realizing potential gains will often involve the fosteringand management of collaborative research. even socalled shortterm research is typically a multiyear proposition and requires validation in thefield at real disasters, as well as simulations. (examples of technologies inthis category and described in chapter 4 are softwaredefined radios,tools for data mining across diverse information sources, decision sentinels, deployable sensor networks, and computerassisted disaster simulation training tools.)¥general researchñissues requiring research followed by adaptation todisaster management. some problem areas in disaster management overlapgeneral needs in it management. it is a broad, active area of research,and relevant research aimed specifically at disaster management is performed at university, commercial, and government laboratories and issponsored by the same constellation of agencies. many of these labs areengaged in broad areas of research that have the potential to develop newit capabilities which, though not directed specifically to that end, couldbe harnessed for disaster management. as with applied research, thisresearch is typically a multiyear proposition. further development or adaptation may also be needed for effective utilization in disaster manageimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.improving acquisition and adoption of it99box 3.3interdisciplinary research forenhancing disaster managementinterdisciplinary approaches to disaster management have been discussedfor quite some time. as noted in the recent nrc report facing hazards and disasters, interdisciplinary research (i.e., research that blends researchers, expertise,and tools from a variety of disciplines to address compelling and crosscutting problems) has been gaining prominence in almost every field of scientific endeavor,including disaster management research.1 indeed, the report cites earlier nrcwork that describes four factors promoting the growth of interdisciplinary research:(1) the complexity of nature and society, (2) the desire to address scientific problems that cross disciplines, (3) the need to solve societyõs problems, and (4) thepower of new technologies.2the benefits of interdisciplinary research for disaster management can besubstantial. for example, facing hazards and disasters describes a number ofòexemplarsó of interdisciplinary research in disaster managementñfrom infrastructure failures and urban economics to casualty analysis through a common framework to decision making for risk protection. however, facing hazards and disasters also goes on to describe how interdisciplinary research can be particularlychallenging when overlapping social sciences with natural sciences (somethingone sees quite a bit of in disaster management research).according to the same report, interdisciplinary research for disaster management faces a number of significant challenges of its own (in addition to the normalchallenges for such research, such as lack of funding and academic incentives) ifit is to prove successful. for example, the report notes that some issues often stemfrom òthe failure of a research team to function collaborativelyó owing to such thingsas difficulties in spanning culture gaps between the disciplines or the devaluationor undervaluation by one discipline of the work of another. another challenge citedrevolves around how disaster management research is most often viewed as applied research rather than basic research geared toward advancing overall knowledge in a given area.facing hazards and disasters surveys the available literature in the areaand also suggests a number of factors contributing to the success of interdisciplinary research (pp. 186187). first, it notes that problemoriented research isprobably best suited for interdisciplinary work in disaster management. second,it notes that the particular characteristics and abilities of researchersñincludingsuch things as interpersonal skillsñare very important for such interdisciplinaryresearch. third, it describes how studies that keep research teams relativelysmall and have stable membership appear to be more successful at integrationand research.1national research council, facing hazards and disasters: understanding human dimensions, the national academies press, washington, d.c., 2006, p. 181.2national research council, facilitating interdisciplinary research, the national academies press, washington, d.c., 2005.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.100improving disaster managementment, which may add more time. this report identifies topics that requiregeneral research, but it is not expected that funding specific for disastermanagement will be employed for these topics. (examples of technologies in this category and described in chapter 4 are delaytolerant networking, automated information fusion from diverse sources, and calibrated information confidence tools.)roadmappingany research agenda aimed at improving the longterm effectivenessof it use in disaster management must be placed in the context of thetechnology pipeline and must prioritize the items in the agenda againsteach other, in particular noting where progress in one area may be dependent on progress in other areas or on organizational advances. an efficient approach to investment requires a clear vision of the path to improvement and a detailed understanding of the individual pieces of theproblem and their interrelationships, together with a mechanism to measure progress.disaster management is, ultimately, a systemlevel problem. thus,improving it use in disaster management requires a systemlevel approach. the research agenda is likely to have the most impact if it conforms to a clear vision of the path to improvement defined in a fullyarticulated roadmap. by establishing a process for making improvements,currently unimagined concerns can be efficiently addressed as they arise,and as both technology and practice evolve.a technology roadmap is a planning tool that can provide information to make better technology investment decisions by identifying critical technologies, technology gaps, and interdependencies between technologies that dictate coordination of research and development cycles. itcan also help uncover interconnections between technologies and adoption issues related to organizational or human behavior characteristics.perhaps most importantly, it can serve as a mechanism through whichdiverse participants, often with conflicting priorities but with commongoals (i.e., saving lives and reducing economic and other impacts), cancooperate to address a larger problem of common interestñin this casethe most effective handling of disasters possible.until relatively recently, the technology choices facing most disastermanagement organizations were comparatively few, with much of theinvestment focused on building specialized communications systems inclose partnership with a small set of vendors. today, there is a muchwider set of technology options available. there is also an increasing needfor the diverse organizations with public safety and homeland securityresponsibilities to be able to cooperate during largescale disasters. inimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness,

as dhsõs select equipment list).an effective, useful roadmap is driven by a clear set of userdriven(not technologydriven) goals and needs to evolve continuously as a living document in consultation with the full range of stakeholders. somepieces of a roadmap are in place (e.g., the national incident managementsystem), but an overarching strategic vision of how it can best be evolvedand applied to disaster management is missing.a roadmap can serve as an anchor for a strategic vision and helppolicy makers avoid lurching from one priority to the next, driven by themost recent major disaster. unfortunately, in the absence of a roadmap,more or less haphazard, reactionary it investment is occurring and islikely to continue.10 new incidents (like a major hurricane) should triggera reevaluation of the existing roadmap, potentially leading to some adjustments in priorities within the strategic framework. but the continuityof investments should result in continuous and more predictable improvements in the application of it to disaster management.a roadmap can also assist policy makers and planners in balancinginvestments across different technologies appropriate at different timesin the disaster management life cycle, that is, mitigation preparation, response, and recovery. a roadmap can also make explicit investmentchoices concerning tradeoffs among competing priorities and betweentensions such as security versus openness and other such tensions previously identified.finally, a roadmapping process provides an opportunity to considerthe interrelationships between technology and organizational models andtechnology and policy. successful technology development and deployment are widely understood to require active consideration of the organizational context in which they will be introduced. similarly, potentialpolicy barriers must be considered when developing new technologiesand organizational approaches.critical to the success of a roadmap activity is the inclusion of a broadarray of stakeholders and an institutional home to get started and remainviable. all participants must make a longterm commitment to the resulting roadmap and to its continuing evolution as technological advancesand organizational innovations are made.10the fiscal year 2007 senate appropriations bill for the department of homeland security shows evidence of this type of planning, focusing on hurricanes and immigration. seemichael arnone, òdhs bill slashes research funds,ó federal computer week, july 17, 2006,p. 11; available at

military, for example, usesa roadmapping approach in its quadrennial defense review report11 todrive plans for incorporating technology advances into its future capabilities. the international electronics manufacturing initiative has developeda sensors technology roadmap that examines technology capabilities andapplications in a variety of sectors, including transportation, health care,and consumer electronics.12perhaps the most familiar application of roadmapping is the semiconductor industryõs roadmap. in the late 1980s, it became clear that theintegrated circuit industry was not only a rapidly growing part of theglobal economy but also critically important to the economy and nationalsecurity of the united states. unfortunately, concerns grew that the unitedstates, after an initial leading role, had fallen behind in technology leadership relative to other countries, especially those in asia. a 1990 nationalresearch council report outlined the consequences of not maintaining acommercial and technological lead in this area.13 the semiconductor industry association (sia) would take on the role of pulling together alongterm technology roadmap for the industry based both on enduserneeds and technology trends.this was not an industrial plan in the usual sense, but rather anagreed on, coordinated vision that would help each organization plandevelopment and investment strategies that would bring the thousandsof pieces of technology needed to make an integrated circuit together atthe right time and the right level of development. a technology piecedeveloped too early would be prohibitively expensiveñdeveloped toolate it would not be profitable. market forces would ensure that vendorsand suppliers would tool up to meet a particular need at the right time,and even researchers understood the targets for conventional technologyand could choose areas for research that, if successful, would have themost impact. unlike other attempts at planning, this was not directed at aspecific technology goal, but rather at the process of continuously improv11the 2006 quadrennial defense review report notes in its preface that the ideas and proposals in the report are provided as a roadmap for change. the report is available at http://www.comw.org/qdr/qdr2006.pdf.12charles e. richardson et al., òsensor technology roadmapping efforts at inemi,óieee transactions on

thefoundation for the next important advance.built into the creation of the roadmap was a process that drove continuous updates and refinements, making it a living document with continued relevance and ensuring that it was up to date with advances inscience, technology, and market needs. by the end of the 1990s, after threemajor updates and the associated strengthening of the u.s. semiconductor industry, there was a push to expand the roadmap process to a globalscale so that the vision would match the expanding scale of the industry.today it is a joint effort of industry, government, and academic representatives from the united states, europe, korea, japan, and taiwan. it is thecritical common view driving ongoing investment in research, development, and manufacturing in one of the largest and most complex components of the global economy.the roadmap for disaster management would be quite different fromthat of the semiconductor industry. specifically, the sia roadmap wasmade possible when an entire industry needed to plan for future generations of fabrication equipment and realized that this highly capitalintensive equipment was beyond the means of any one industry participantñit required cooperation with other participants. this created anenvironment where cooperation within a specific framework, embodiedby the sia roadmap, was possible, while allowing continued competitionin areas outside of that framework.in contrast, disaster management organizations and the associationsthat represent them would necessarily drive the roadmapping processenvisioned here. yet, the key element remainsñthe need to create a framework within which cooperation can happen in order to address commongoals that are otherwise unattainable or suboptimal. by joining togetherto develop a roadmap, they would have a forum for speaking with acommon and consistent voice to the vendor community about technologyneeds.there are also similarities from a process perspective; stakeholderscreate a living document that explicitly lays out a vision for continuousprogress based on balancing value and cost, as well as carefully considering technical and organizational feasibility. then, investment fromall sectors can then be committed to track this vision as it evolves. asuccessful roadmapping process would ultimately result in full andactive participation of the vendor community, just as the sia roadmapprocess eventually included the entire worldwide semiconductor industry, including those who spurred its development as the perceivedòadversaries.óimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.104improving disaster managementresearch centers:coupling technology research with practicesuccessful development, adoption, and utilization of it for disastermanagement require several different communities be in regular and closecontact with one another. researchers tend to look for overarching themes,but experience has demonstrated the importance, in the field of disastermanagement, of starting with real problems faced by real practitioners,working back from there to overarching themes. starting with overarchingresearch themes will likely lead to dead ends and unimplementable technology.14 practitioners must help define needs for new technology, thusacting as inspiration for researchers and developers. they must interactwith developers and vendors throughout the prototyping cycle and development process to ensure that their needs are indeed addressed. itresearchers must have opportunities to expose practitioners to novel concepts in order to generate an understanding of potential new capabilitiesand how they might fit into current and future operations. public administrators, social scientists, and it researchers all play important roles inensuring that it innovations are introduced with the necessary organizational changes to enable new devices and systems to be smoothly integrated into practice.forging organizational ties is harder in disaster management than itis in sectors like defense because the vast majority of practitioners aredistributed across local agencies that are normally fairly isolated fromeach other and from the research community. nevertheless, integratingthe experiences and needs of these different agencies is crucial, sincesooner or later when a disaster of a severe enough magnitude strikes, theyare bound to have to work together. some regional groups of organizations that have already experienced the need to work together have successfully initiated the process of forging organizational ties, suggestingthat building from a bottomup approach is likely to be most effective.moreover, successful it development is iterative. it is important toprovide practitioners with initial prototypes to bootstrap the iterativeprocess. testbeds and exercises are particularly critical in the area ofdisaster management because they provide opportunities for feedbackfrom actual users about critical requirements of responders that may nototherwise be apparent. in some cases, largescale testbeds are required tounderstand issues that only emerge at scale. simulations present oppor14this point was made repeatedly by workshop

facilities thatpermit instrumentation, experimentation, and iteration are needed.collaborative research centers could, therefore, play a highly usefulrole in advancing the effective application of it to disaster management.the major goals of such centers would be sixfoldñ(1) to develop a sharedunderstanding of the experiences and challenges in all phases of disastermanagement from both a technological and organizational perspective,(2) to evaluate the application of technology advances to disaster management practice, (3) to develop a culture and processes for transitioningknowledge and technology to the operational communities on a sustainedbasis, (4) to build human capital at the intersection of information technology and disaster management, (5) to serve as repositories for data andfor lessons learned from past disasters and disaster management efforts,and (6) to provide forwardlooking analysis to inform the development oftechnology capabilities, associated organizational processes, and roadmapdevelopment.the research conducted by these centers would be multidisciplinary,combining the efforts of information scientists, engineers, and social scientists. participants would be charged with collecting knowledge andexperience from past disasters and using it to build a core set of knowledge that would inform the development of technology capabilities andassociated organizational processes to enhance the management of futureevents. the centers would closely partner with federal, state, and localagencies responsible for disaster management. indeed, experienced andcapable emergency management officials and operational units from disaster management organizations should be deeply involved in the workof these centers. one approach for engaging these government agenciescould be to provide them with incremental funds specifically for workingwith researchers and to develop nextgeneration technologies.to ensure that the work of the centers is informed by and responsiveto the needs of disaster management, centers would bring in disastermanagement professionals from all levels of government as visiting fellows. to inform additional researchers about the problems of disastermanagement, university faculty and students would be offered internships and fellowships. finally, to help encourage development of technology based on the research results, the involvement of relevant industrywould be promoted through informational activities and the sharing ofexpertise and results.multiple centers for research would have several advantages over asingle research center. they would enable healthy intellectual competition and crossfertilization of ideas and allow for specialization in specific types of disasters, specific technology capabilities, or the compreimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

benefit from expertise residing in local emergency response organizations and other local government agencies. for instance, a centernear known earthquakeprone areas may focus on technology related toimproving earthquakespecific disaster management. different centerscould specialize in practical and responseoriented work, combining coreas well as geographyspecific expertise. close coordination and sharingof information and expertise among centers would help avoid unnecessary duplication.a major goal of these centers would be to develop a culture of continuously transitioning knowledge and it between researchers and operational communities. this is very different from the usual academicmodel of licensing technology to a third party, or creating a startup. acontinuous process of reviewing user requirements, knowledge generation, collaboration, validation, acceptance, implementation, and incorporation of new user needs must be encouraged.field researchñworking on large problems outside the labsñappearsto be particularly valuable to making progress on using it for disastermanagement. it pushes researchers in new directions. it also stresses thetechnology under the extreme conditions inherent in disaster situations,exposing issues unlikely to be discovered in a laboratory setting. practitionersõ participation in such research gives them an opportunity to seethe potential for new information technologies. it also gives them a chanceto influence its direction. the goal is to close the gap between researchersand practitioners and create a unified core community that can speed upthe process of delivering research results of immediate relevance to disaster management. panelists at the workshop held by the committee citedthe disaster management interoperability

advanced sensors, communication technology,and similar it increases, it becomes ever easier to collect data about the15see national research council, summary of a workshop on using information

colorado at boulder; the disaster researchcenter at the university of delaware, which investigates the social science aspects of disasters; the hazard reduction and recovery center attexas a&m

application of it to enhance disaster management. these itenabled capabilities are used here to provide a frameworkfor organizing research and development needs and opportunities described in this section as part of a research and development agenda. thischapter is intended to provide an initial sketch of the kinds of items thatwould ultimately appear in an it roadmap for disaster management. thecommittee sought in particular to identify technologies under investigation that may hold largely unrecognized promise for advancing disastermanagement, though more apparently promising technologies are described as well. developers of a roadmap could use this survey as a starting point for developing a fully articulated plan, including a detailed setof research directions to be pursued.in developing this initial sketch of a research agenda for use in an itroadmap, the committee made some assumptions about the continuationof a number of technology trends occurring independently of the needs ofdisaster management. the agenda is not aimed at influencing the direction of these trends, which the committee believes will continue regardless of the research agenda identified here. however, an it roadmapwould have to assume the continuation of current trends as a necessaryfoundation for the development and commercialization of major aspectsof the disaster management research agenda and should incorporate themas base technology trends. roadmap developers may need to account forimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.elements of a research agenda109deviations from those trends should they occur. the technology trendsassumed are as follows:¥continued improvements in the cost and capabilities of all aspectsof computing and data processing, including computer processing power(òpopularó form of mooreõs law), storage capacity, energy efficiency, andnetwork bandwidth;¥continuing increases in the capability in the existing commercialcellular network: more capacity for voice and data, as well as new classesof handsets with longbatterylifetime data capability, and increasingfunctionality;¥continued progress toward transforming communication systemsfrom vulnerable and unreliable direct links to more robust, distributed,and selfrepairing grids using new approaches in mesh networking andadaptive radios;¥continued progress toward universal compatibility of all communication and computing technologies by basing them on the underlyinginternet technology (i.e., òip everywhereó);¥continued growth of open source software methodology to allowrapid creation of new, highreliability applications built on the experiencebase of existing ones;¥increasing use of highvolume commercial technology componentsin specialized systems in order to spread component development costsover a much larger base, to build systems more rapidly by exploitingexisting components, and to increase reliability through increased fieldexperience;¥rapid spread in the availability of lowcost, ubiquitous public wireless data networking, especially at the municipal level;¥continued improvements in linking geographic information to existing and future data applications (e.g., google maps), and all types ofdatabases such as geographic, medical, building plan, toxicology, weather,and image databases; and¥continued rapid progress in biochemistry, electronics, micromechanics, and nanotechnology that can be expected to lead to cheaper,smaller, and betterperforming sensors, actuators, and other devices.under each key itenabled capability, technologies are listed roughlyin order of their current position in the technology pipeline. this is necessarily only an approximation, as many technologies consist of multipleiterations and incarnations that vary in their degree of readiness (andvalue) for application in the field. for each item listed, a brief descriptionis provided, indicating both general and specific directions for potentialadvances and some example applications for disaster management.improving disaster

listed with one capability area may applyacross a number of capability areas. they have been listed with the capability area that they appear most likely to advance. similarly, many of thetechnologies are interconnected. they may need to be combined to effectimprovement in a specific application, such as better assessment of structural damage. advancement in one area may be predicated on advancement in other areas: for example, improvement in energy technology topower mobile devices is required before advances in several other technology areas can be widely exploited. this report does not make a detailed assessment of these interdependencies. however, identifying andplanning for them would be a major part of the development of a technology roadmap.more robust, interoperable, andprioritysensitive communications¥exploitation of cellular, wireless networking, and internet protocol (ip)based technology. all of these commercially available technologies can beapplied more systematically in disaster management practice to improvecommunications resilience by adding redundancy and standardsbasedinteroperability. effective use of these technologies requires enhancingoperational procedures among public safety and emergency managementorganizations. they should seek to employ alternative communicationscapabilities and implement fallback communication strategies when communication resources are overloaded or impaired (e.g., text messaging inplace of voice calls). the opportunities for integrating mature and maturing technologies into disaster management are abundant. the struggle isnot so much the usefulness of the technologies, but the processes andstructures, which limit their implementation. box 4.1 details characteristics of cellular technology that hold potential for improving disastermanagement.¥redundant and resilient infrastructure. many communications problems are caused by the destruction of communication devices or communication lines and by the loss of power. these are often the result ofdamage to physical structures (buildings, cell towers). hardening the infrastructure is an obvious way to reduce failure of equipment and linesand reduce the chances of power loss. while it is not economically infeasible to harden all relevant equipment for worstcase scenarios (worstcase hurricanes and earthquakes, terrorist attacks), improvements are certainly possible.¥mobile cellular infrastructure. cellular system capabilities could bemodified and satellite communications links could be integrated to enable quickly deployable communication systems for use in disasters.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.elements of a research agenda111¥intelligent spectrum sharing. spectrum shared more flexibly betweencommercial and public safety users and better use of spectrum throughimproved radio technologies and policy continue to receive significantfocus. it is for this reason that this report mentions spectrum issues onlyin passing, though the committee views dealing with spectrum issues asan important component of any technology roadmap.¥multiple input/multiple output (mimo) wireless systems. antennas,coding, and modulation could be improved to enhance radio performance. mimo wireless systems take advantage of miniaturization to incorporate an array of radios and antennas in both the handsets and basestations as an economical way to increase user capacity. this technologyhas demonstrated a multiplicative increase in capacity and spectral efficiency; dramatic reductions of signal fading thanks to diversity; increasedsystem capacity (number of users); and improved resistance to interference. fundamental research is needed to fully realize these benefits inpractical wireless systems.¥nonvoice communications for first responders. voice is a natural communication medium, and first responders are trained to use it reliablyunder stress. unfortunately, even the besttrained person is limited in theamount and kind of information he or she can process using voice communication. careful integration of voice input/output with data applications could extend usersõ ability to process information from a broaderknowledge base while reducing cognitive overload to leverage the scarceasset of trained operators.¥integrated voice/data/video. separate systems for different modes ofcommunication are inherently inefficient (although separate systems mayprovide useful redundancy), and integrated communication provideseconomies of scope and scale. by providing users with a more generalpurpose device, new applications can be more easily introduced. manytechnologies (e.g., ipbased, cellular) naturally provide both voice anddata communications in an integrated fashion: that is, they use a singleinfrastructure, set of protocols, and terminal device. adaptation of thetechnology, such as the development of special terminals that meet therobustness requirements of first responders or that also provide access toexisting communication infrastructures, may be required.¥policybased access control mechanisms. access control lists (acls)are used extensively today for enforcing policies governing the type ofaccess (e.g., read, read/write, print) a user has to information. policiesare hardcoded into acls, but having the policy hardcoded causes management and security problems. research into mechanisms for implementing acls that eliminate these problems promises to provide theflexibility and ability to operate in the inherently dynamic environmentof a disaster.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.112improving disaster managementbox 4.1opportunities to better apply a maturing technology:commercial cellular technologycell phone technology has several salient features today for communicationsin a disaster. cellular technology provides communication that is logically defined.whom one communicates with is defined by who is dialed or by logical talk groupsrather than by who happens to be within radio range. this implies that one canexclude conversations within radio range as well as communicate with users beyond this range via networking technology.cellular technology communicates with other technologies, both wireless andwireline. cellular communication interconnects with many different cellular radiotechnologies, with traditional landline phones, and with internetbased phones.both pointtopoint communications and logical talk group communication is possible. nextel using motorola iden technology has led the way with walkietalkieliketalk group technology. other cellular technology vendors are following suit. cellphones send both voice and data. the data include short messaging service, internet access, and communication control data used to operate the system.applications other than voice are already available. e911 provides a localization application. (many e911 implementations use the global positioning system [gps]; other technologies are available.) camera phones can take pictures orshort videos and send them. cell systems can have information services thatbroadcast local weather, traffic conditions, breaking news, and so on.the hardware cost of cellular handsets is low relative to that for land mobileradio (lmr) handsets, in part owing to the economies of scale from so widelyadopted a technology. cellular handset battery life is quite good. a phone with lowactivity can last many days. a busy phone can have hours of talk time.cell phones have many inherent personal digital assistant capabilities, suchas memo pads, alarms, and searchable phonebooks. cell phones are small andlightweight, a fraction of the equivalent lmr radio. the keyboards are small, butmany handsets include handsfree voice dialing. the handsets are designed to bequickly reprogrammed with different cell phone numbers, service provider profiles,and network configurations. in some cases this can be done over the air. cellphone interfaces come in packages other than handsets and can be embedded in¥softwaredefined radios. softwaredefined radio (sdr) technologiesprovide softwarecontrolled configurability of radios and their incorporation into networks. remote configuration of frequency bands, interference management, operational and control protocols, and security options offer the promise of flexibility, easy incorporation acrossheterogeneous organizations and applications, and lifecycle cost reductions through high volume. (see box 4.2 for further discussion.)¥delaytolerant networking. current communication systems that depend on pointtopoint links are vulnerable to disruptions but have theadvantage of very low delay when they are working. distributed systemsare inherently more robust because they can reroute traffic as needed, butimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response,

data, or a tracking tag could use the cellular infrastructure.cellular can operate robustly under high traffic loads. when the load of thesystem exceeds capacity, calls will have to be blocked. the question is whetherthe network still maintains control over who gets blocked and what kind of communication can take place. this depends on the communication control mechanisms.most cellular standards automatically expand their communication control capacityas the demand on the network increases. they can maintain control of the networkwith network overloads that are many times the capacity of the traffic channels. toa common user, voice calls will be blocked and the system unusable. other userscan be given priority access to the available channel and may experience little orno blocking. though voice calls are blocked, the common user may still be able tosend other types of communication such as short message service, a phenomenon noted after the july 2005 london bombings and after hurricane katrina. thesefeatures of cellular technology can be exploited for disaster management. thedifficulty is whether this is done using commercial cellular infrastructure or buildinga parallel or supplemental infrastructure.cellular technology is, of course, exploited for commercial purposes by cellular service providers. commercial cellular service is provided throughout most populated areas. the cellular industry expends billions of dollars per year to expandthe number of cell sites.1 the area of coverage and capacity continues to growsteadily, along with the growth of subscribers and the types of services to whichthey subscribe. building parallel infrastructure for emergency services is clearlycostprohibitive. yet, both public safety communications officials and cellular infrastructure owners have valid concerns about piggybacking disaster communications on existing commercial infrastructure. addressing these concerns and overcoming the issues with innovative policy approaches in the spirit of public/privatepartnership should be a major focus of roadmap developers.1according to the cellular telecommunications industry association, a total infrastructureinvestment of $25.3 billion was made in 2005 alone. other statistics on coverage and capacityare available at http://www.ctia.org/researchstatistics/index.cfm/aid/10202.this leads unavoidably to longer and less predictable delays in transit.delaytolerant network (dtn) architectures and protocols are an effort toaddress this problem in ipbased networks (e.g., the internet), particularly those operating in environments characterized by very long delaypaths and frequent network partitions, such as mobile or extreme environments that lack continuous network connectivity typical in disasters.a focus of dtn research is to provide interoperable communications insuch environments.¥passive and active embedded links and relays. these devices hold promise for enhancing communication in buildings, rubble, and underground.building construction has been modified and existing buildings retrofitimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.114improving disaster managementbox 4.2softwaredefined radiosadvances in digital technology are making possible a new generation of communication devices that can be configured in software to operate on different frequency bands, in different modes, and to present different operational and controloptions to the user. such òsoftware radiosó can be reconfigured remotely (òover theairó), enabling the rapid reassignment of wireless devices among different preexisting networks. rapid reassignments can provide several important endusercapabilities. first, allowing the radio to switch between many standard modes willfacilitate connectivity between incompatible networks and allow individuals to movesmoothly between task groups operating on different legacy systems.second, adding sensing and reasoning capabilities creates socalled cognitive radios that can dynamically adapt to the current user traffic needs, radio congestion, spectrum and operational policies, and radio capabilities to optimize overall communication efficacy; the addition of these capabilities is a precondition forseveral novel proposals for expanding the spectrum available to first responders indisasters. finally, in extreme conditions, such as high noise or poor propagationthrough a building, the user can select radio modes and frequencies that will optimize their connectivity. because of the critical importance of power and cost todisaster management communications systems, there should be a limited numberof wellregulated modes for such radios to use, as determined by both researchand current practices. this would allow mobile units to be optimized for efficientuse of each of these modes.the more attractive option of having a completely flexible radio that can process an arbitrary signal will probably remain impractical because of the energyrequirements of complex computations at gigahertz frequencies. many challengesremain before such systems will be available, such as how various radios getinformed as to which traffic they should copy and which traffic they should ignore,and how that gets done dynamically, in real time, and securely (if necessary).ted with technology improvements for better earthquake survivability.similar advances are possible to improve the resilience of communications infrastructure. these advances may allow wireless communicationsinto and out of the building and through the rubble of a destroyed building, through passive means such as embedded tuned conductors or activemeans such as embedded relay arrays, similar to the emergency lightingsystems already mandated.¥policybased routing and congestion management. transmission congestion occurs during periods of high volumes of communication wheninformation arrives faster than the network can handle it. policybasedrouting and congestion management could make it possible to prioritizeand schedule transmission according to a specified policy. a policybasedframework would permit the behavior of the system to be modified withimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright

repairing (autonomous and adaptive) networks. autonomous and adaptive networks that are able to reconfigure and repairthemselves could improve infrastructure robustness, even when infrastructure has been partially destroyed. these networks are envisioned tobe unattended systems, with applications relevant to disaster management ranging from environmental sensing to structural monitoring andemergency response. advances may result in communication infrastructure that supports needbased connectivity without boundaries and withminimal human intervention. such a capability requires research not onlyon lowlevel communication (i.e., connectivity) but also on connectivitymanagement and adaptive computerbased learning and managementsystems.¥locationbased monitoring of communications infrastructure capacityand adaptive access to available communications channels. it systems withthese capabilities would allow matching of the message form to the fastest, most appropriate network environment available to each user. automated routing could allow senders to put out a message and let the system figure out how to get it to the right recipients.¥speech interfaces. visual displays and input schemes that are familiar in the office environment are not always suited to the needs of disasterresponders. in particular, the use of visual displays in the field, particularly in highly mobile and/or highstress activities with difficult visibilityconditions, can create unwelcome distraction and even induce a form ofdisorientation that can be extremely risky. as speechrecognition andspeechsynthesis capabilities improve, speechcommand and audiooutput interfaces become increasingly feasible.¥tactile interfaces. these are user interfaces that employ touch forinput and/or output. examples of existing tactile interface technologyinclude a braille reader and touch screens. in hostile and loud environments, auditory contact may be difficult. advances in tactile interfaces,like the vibrating ring on a cell phone, offer promise for improving communications in these environments.¥adaptive mesh networks. although data networks are frequently described as selfhealing in case of damage or disruption, many actual networks have been constructed more for economy than for resilience. compromises have led to the creation of single points of failure and relativelyinflexible routing schemes. wireless òad hocó meshes would include thecapability of rapid provisioning of voice and data service in disasterstricken areas, a feature that could also enhance the reliability and capacity of daytoday networks. if wireless ad hoc mesh networks werecoupled with advanced, distributed machinelearning algorithms, theseimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation,

minimalhuman intervention, minimizing the cost and delays associated with that.adaptive mesh networks also offer the opportunity to use distributedcomputing techniques for increasing analysis and decisionmaking resources beyond those available to any single node.¥standards as òmiddleware.ó various terms such as òserviceorientedarchitectureó and òenterprise service busó are used to describe a datainteroperability strategy based not on centralized interconnection services,but rather on direct connections between diverse it systems using standardized data representations. this is basically

(see box 4.3 for a more detailed discussion of serviceoriented architectures.)¥advanced power sources. improvements in power sources includingfuel cells and tritium could have profound effects on the ability to deployand use it in disaster management. often, the lack of infrastructurebasedpower, the limited life of batteries, and the bulkiness of òportableó batteries or generators limit the scope and range for application of it. anychemical fuel generator or storage systemñbattery, fuel cell, turbine, compressed gas, flywheel, and so onñhas basically the same fundamentalenergy limit of the chemical binding energy between atoms. battery capacity is increasing slowly as these devices are better engineered, butmajor advances in chemical batteries are highly unlikely. (box 4.4 describes these technologies in more detail.)¥mobile power source efficiency and energy management. at least fivetechniques could be employed and advanced to improve the efficiency ofpowering mobile devices: harvesting energy from the environment, usingpassive radios that modulate reflected radio signals rather than generating radio signals directly, reducing interference by better traffic coordination, improving power source recovery and redundancy, and efficientspectrum sharing.

model computing applications as networks of òblack boxó functions, each characterized by a published network interface based on shared technical standards. instead of the tightly coupled integration of software modules on a single computing platform, soas build applicationsby selecting from among a range of services over a network in order to support aneeded function or business process. soas promise numerous benefits, includingseveral of particular interest to disaster management:¥the ability to utilize multiple sources of a single service, which can helpeliminate single points of failure due to disaster effects;¥the ability to scale up applications efficiently during sudden surges in demand by concentrating resources on the particular services that present bottlenecks;¥a reduction in the òswitching costsó associated with migration from one providerõs services to a competitorõs, thus maintaining competition, reducing òlockinóeffects, and òfutureproofingó the application as a whole; and¥enabling support of exceptional or ad hoc business processes by therapid assembly of services into new configurations (sometimes called realtimeintegration).however, as soabased applications evolve to mirror business practicesmore closely, the actual design and evaluation of such applications become lessand less a technical problem and increasingly a direct concern for the end users.consumers of soas are increasingly called on to perform rigorous analyses anddocumentation of their requirements and practices. this can create conflicts withresourcebound emergency managers, who may perceive such rigor as a threat totheir autonomy and their freedom to adapt to circumstances. a great deal of research remains to be done on the interface between serviceoriented it architectures and their users. of particular importance is determining the most convenientand rapid methods of collaborating with end users in the processes of soa design,evaluation, and adjustment.resource discovery and tracking, allowing realtime views of deploymentand status that can be used for optimizing effectiveness.¥embedded, networked sensors. as the density of a sensor networkincreases due to sensorsõ reduced size, power, cost, and ubiquitous connectivity options, the data they return change in quality as well as quantity. complex or subtle spatial and temporal patterns become visible thatcould not be resolved before. at the same time, increased data processingpower and enhanced presentation techniques allow the analysis and fusion of these dense data streams into usable situational awareness andanalytic products.¥routine information fusion. often, combining (fusing) informationimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.118improving disaster managementbox 4.4advanced power sourcesthe foundation of a reliable wireless communication system, whether builtusing mobile units or remote sensors, is a reliable and longlasting power source.the complex networks envisioned in this report will require a means to provide thatpower in a lightweight, longlasting package that can be recharged, if necessary,onsite. in addition, to the extent that it is desirable to move from simple voicecommunications to transmission of more complex data at higher rates, the energyrequirements will increase even further. over the past several decades, the aggressive shrinking of electronics has reduced the cost, size, and power of electronic devices at a rate of nearly 50 percent per year.unfortunately, over the same time interval, chemical batteries have been improving only slowly, with average specific capacity increases of less than 7 percentper year. since there are no new elements available, the ultimate performance ofchemical batteries is well understood, and the slow yeartoyear improvementscome only from steady engineering advances. many alternatives have been proposed, from fuel cells to flywheels, but ultimately they all depend on the strength ofchemical bonds and will not be able to provide truly dramatic improvements incapacity.to improve the capability and reliability of portable it equipment dramatically,there appear to be three possibilities beyond the small improvements expectedfrom steady engineering of existing batteries. the first is to make full use of therapid advances in the performance of electronics to reduce the power required foreach function. this is critically important for computation functions such as codingor data acquisition, but less important for the communication function where theenergy is consumed by generating a strongenough radio signal to reach the intended receiver. the second route to improvement is to design the communicationnetwork from the ground up to be energy efficient. for example, a higher density ofreadily deployed small base stations or repeaters will allow the handsets to reachthe network with a minimum of radio power. also, changes in protocols, coding,and signal processing can make substantial improvements.finally, abandoning chemical power sources and adopting some form of nuclear power can provide substantial improvements, since the energy per atomavailable in a nuclear process can range from several thousand to several milliontimes that for chemical energy. the first generation of such cells has energy content greater than 10 times that of the best chemical cells, and the theoretical limitfor the useful life of these cells is at least 100 times that of chemical cells. thistechnology is based on the use of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen thatcan be easily encapsulated, is not chemically toxic, and emits only beta radiationthat cannot penetrate the skin. this technology has been in commercial use foryears to power emergency lighting and provide other specialtytask illuminationneeds where an external power supply would be unacceptable. moving to otherradioactive materials, like those already incorporated in smoke detectors, can increase the limiting energy densities by another factor of 1,000 or more, though theengineering problems of gathering that energy efficiently are not yet solved.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.elements of a research agenda119from several different sources can provide greatly enhanced understanding of a situation. an example might be a map showing both road conditions and the number of people needing evacuation across a geographicarea. unfortunately, such information sources were usually developedindependently of each other for different uses in nonemergency conditions, and bringing them together is a significant, ongoing challenge indevelopment and applied research, depending on suitability of source.box 4.5mobile power source efficiency and energy managementfollowing are five techniques for improving the efficiency of energy management in mobile devices:¥harvesting energy from the environment. energy harvesting has an important place for distributed sensor or repeater networks without external powersources where energy can be collected from lowpower sources such as light,vibration, pressure, and so on and stored over long periods for application duringemergencies.¥passive radios. passive radios are currently used for lowbitrate, shortrange sensor systems, like inventory control tags, where the base station sends asignal to the sensor that just modulates the reflection of that signal back to thebase station. the entire operation of the sensor can be powered by the signal fromthe base station, or a battery can be used to supplement this energy, but thebattery has a very long service life because it does not need to transmit, onlymodulate, radio frequency.¥reducing interference and noise. at the system level, there is enormouspotential to improve radio powerconsumption efficiency through a properly designed communication system. energy to transmit data depends on the ratio ofsignal power to noise (or interference) power. lowering the noise or interferenceby an order of magnitude reduces the signal power requirements by an equalamount. (it is easier to communicate in a room full of people if each person speaksin turn rather than all at once.) for example, a typical public service radio (e.g.,xts5000 motorola) has a range comparable to that of a cell phone (e.g., motorolav276) but a performance that is substantially different. the cell phone can be usedto talk/listen for nearly 4 hours or wait for an incoming call for nearly 300 hours, allon a battery weighing 1 1/2 oz. the public safety radio has a useful battery life ofonly 8 hours (about 30 minutes for talking, 30 minutes for listening, and 7 hours forwaiting for a call) using a battery over 4 times heavier. this is partially due to amore efficient radio and partially due to the ability of the base station to tell thehandset to lower its energy consumption dynamically to the smallest value sufficient for efficient communication.¥efficient spectrum sharing. proper coordination and the use of narrowbandchannels could also lead to significant improvements in power requirements. thepublic safety radio blocks other radios from using its channel, in contrast to the cellphone system, which is designed for highly efficient sharing of scarce spectrumresources.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.120improving disaster management¥publish/subscribe information dissemination. one of the great challenges in a fluid situation like disaster management is to provide the rightinformation (and the right amount of information) to the right person atthe right time. publish/subscribe network services enable informationdissemination across a potentially unlimited number of geographicallyscattered publishers (information providers) and subscribers (information receivers) along with the ability to customize information at the levelof the individual user. more sophisticated approaches would help to alertusers to novel information identified as potentially relevant on the basisof those usersõ demonstrated patterns of interests.¥semantic routing. traditional methods of information routing arebased on explicit designation of the recipient or recipients. in highly dynamic networks, this can create a òdiscovery bottleneckó as new participants join and existing participants shift roles. a frequent result is thatkey actors inadvertently are left out of the loop for essential informationand others are overloaded with irrelevant data. the next step beyondpublish/subscribe is to use semantic routing techniques that allow information to be shared on the basis of the usersõ content requirements as wellas the originatorsõ directives. semantic routing coupled with intelligentworkflow could offer the ability to move information proactively in orderto accelerate processes (e.g., obtaining of permissions).¥data quality and availability. variations in data quality and availability often plague attempts to share and integrate information for decision making. improving the completeness, timeliness, accuracy, and consistency of data are all areas requiring advances. at the same time, it isnecessary to recognize that imperfect data are and always will be present.there is thus an abiding need for methods of measuring, expressing, andcorrectly interpreting òfuzzyó and intermittent and uncertain data.¥data mining across diverse information sources. the challenge in aninformationrich environment is the ability to extract meaningful knowledge from a plethora of information sources. data fusion across diverseinformation sources has already shown its effectiveness, particularly ingeographically based applications. the next step is to create analysis systems that can extract data and automatically look for patterns using information held in diverse, incompatible databases. an example would be tosearch for patterns in hospital admissions based on information includingweather patterns and possible sources of toxin release. data mining canfind patterns obscured by the volume or diversity of data. intelligentapproaches can corroborate tenuous patterns by consulting multiple alternative sources guided by the nature and context of the conclusion.¥usercentered situational awareness information presentation. with advances in information collection, fusion, dissemination, and delivery, itmay become possible to create customized and dynamic presentations forimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.elements of a research agenda121each user with information most relevant to him or her in the most usefulformat given the userõs location, responsibility, and changes in the situation. research supported by the defense advanced research projectsagencyõs improving warfighter information intake under stress program offers some examples of the type of advances that may be possible.1¥optimized presentation of data. it systems could be engineered toadapt to such things as message form or content, the receiverõs deviceform factor, or the realtime situation of the recipient and to optimize thepresentation of data accordingly. such capability could allow adaptiveaccess to available communications channels, allowing matching of themessage form to the fastest, most appropriate network environment available to each user. for example, the system might not send a completegeographic information system (gis) file to a personal digital assistant,but it would send the complete file to a more powerful workstation with ahighresolution display; it could send a voice announcement instead of atext message to a fully garbed firefighter engaged in a rescue; and automated routing could allow users to permit the system to figure out how toget messages to the right recipients formatted for the equipment availableto them.¥deployable sensor networks. it is impractical to put all classes of sensors in all possible locations before a disaster. however, existing sensornetworks (e.g., sensors in commercial cell phones, public transportation,or private vehicles) could be integrated with ad hoc sensors with appropriate capabilities distributed in response to an existing or anticipatedevent. in the presence of a degraded communication infrastructure, suchad hoc sensor networks use the ability of each node to communicatedirectly with one or more other nodes in its physical vicinity, allowingmessage communication to take place via multihop spreading. becausethese networks are selforganizing and decentralized, they can be highlyreliable and degrade only slowly as individual nodes fail.¥network and information security. traditional security requirementsalso apply to disaster management, including, for example, the need forencryption of (some) communications, authentication of people and datasources, and ensuring the integrity of the infrastructure and the data.indeed, a more ònetworkcentricó approach to disaster management isvulnerable to attacks on the network, the information it carries, and theassociated applications and processes. because disaster management often involves collaboration among many organizations, often in ways thatcannot be anticipated beforehand, it also imposes some unique require1the program was formerly known as augmented cognition. further information onthe program is available at http://www.darpa.mil/dso/thrust/biosci/warfighter.htm.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.122improving disaster managementments: for example, flexible policies that can be changed on the fly andinteroperability across different infrastructures. moreover, the commonsecurity goal of data privacy may be less important, since the goal is oftento disseminate data widely. instead, security needs to ensure data integrity, authenticate the identity and role of users, and authorize access todifferent resources. the network and its applications must also be protected from denialofservice attacks that attempt to overwhelm resourceswith invalid requests so that resources are unavailable for legitimate uses.security research continues to make progress on these issues and has thepotential to protect against malicious adversarial attacks as well as benignfaults or loss of resources.¥biochemical sensors. identifying unknown substances can require along chemical analysis using bulky and expensive equipment that is notsuited to a rapidly evolving field situation. rapid advances in electronicsand biotechnology are beginning to make possible the creation of sensorscapable of detecting specific toxins or deoxyribonucleic acid/ribonucleicacid (dna/rna) patterns. effective use of such devices would helpchange chemical and biological agents from terrifying, invisible dangersto more manageable threats. advanced biochemical sensors show thepromise of lowcost field analysis tools. as the price of these tools decreases, they can be deployed widely in the environment to enable continuous in situ measurements. a toxic plume could be rapidly characterized as to its source and extent through sensors mounted on small,unmanned aerial vehicles that deploy automatically from rooftops withthe first signs of the plume.¥infrastructure instrumentation. both disaster management and continuing social functions depend critically on the status of infrastructurefor supplying water, power, communication, sewage disposal, and transportation. currently, such systems have instrumentation at major criticalpoints of failureñpumping stations, for exampleñbut do not have distributed sensing throughout the network (e.g., to indicate broken pipes).such sensing is critical for rapidly determining the overall status of thesystem after a disaster and effectively planning repair strategies as well asoptimizing the use of the remaining assets while the repairs are beingdone.¥sensor systems. one problem is how to track a person or event as itpasses from the view of one subset of sensors to another. multiple sensorsalso pose situational awareness and interpretation issues compounded bybandwidth limitations: what sensors should be given network priorityand how multiple, geographically separated streams of information canbe fused.¥integrated geographic information systems. long treated as a distinctspecialty with a strong emphasis on detailed analysis and modeling, theimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.elements of a research agenda123gis field is merging into the mainstream of information technology. basegeospatial information and imagery are increasingly used as a context forrealtime data in situational awareness and resourcemanagement applications. at the same time, growing numbers of nonit assets are becoming òlocation awareó by means of gps and various wireless positioningtechniques. integration tools are bringing these disparate sources ofgeospatial information together to enable improved awareness and decisionmaking capabilities.¥portable unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) and (autonomous) robots.the nature of disasters may prevent the normal collection of data byhumans or require sensing capabilities beyond human capacity. robotsand unmanned systems deploying advanced sensors may be helpful inobtaining better and timelier information. unmanned aerial, ground, andsea systems being used extensively by the department of defense couldbe adapted for use in disaster management. during the disaster prevention and preparation phases, unmanned vehicles could be routinely usedas unobtrusive mobile sampling agents. during incident response andrecovery, small aerial and sea vehicles could be used on demand by fieldteams to survey general damage and transportation infrastructure (especially bridges and seawalls). new underwater sensor payloads have beendeveloped that should enable unmanned underwater and surface vehiclesto monitor structures below the waterline. small ground robots were introduced at the world trade center disaster to aid in searching throughthe rubble. small uavs were used in new orleans and mississippi in thehurricane katrina and rita responses.¥epidemiological alerting systems. much more sophisticated uses of itare becoming possible that offer the potential for earlier warnings and afiner degree of understanding of the spread of infection.2 these systemsalso hold promise for mitigating the effects of bioterrorism and otheremerging epidemiological threats, such as avian influenza.improved decision support andresource tracking and allocation¥widely available collaboration software and file sharing. collaborativeenvironments could enable information sharing to reduce duplication of2for example, the national electronic disease surveillance system (nedss) is an initiative that promotes the use of data and information system

distributed whiteboard applications for discussingand communicating decisions. problems such as volume of traffic, number of sources, and dataconsumption requirements must be better understood. a number of fundamental questions must still be answered, suchas what happens when the volume of information on shared file sitesscales up and the number of participants grows. experience with consortia management systems also argues that further advances are needed. byallowing people to interact more easily and more often, better collaboration tools could also foster increased rapport and trust.¥intelligent adaptive planning. intelligent adaptive planning is theprocess of modifying a plan to adapt to changed circumstances. thistype of planning breaks down the barriers between preparation and execution; it eliminates the dual problems of creating plans that are notfollowed and following plans that do not fit. there are several key requirements, each with potentially fruitful lines of research. (see box 4.6for further discussion.)¥computerassisted decisionmaking tools. computer technology couldbe quite useful for decision making with tools like, for instance, onlineresource directories or òdecision sentinelsóñessentially a concept formonitoring crucial processes and activities. decision sentinels attempt toraise warning flags when, for instance, things that are supposed to happen are not happening, when things that are not allowed for are indeedoccurring, or when decision points are slipping. however, significant technical work is necessary in analyzing dependencies and assumptions indisaster plansñif these are understood, plan execution may be monitoredaccordingly, allowing for proactive warning of problems. technologytools might also be useful in decisions involving dropping constraints,elevating conflicts for resolution, or switching to alternate plans.¥distributed emergency operation centers. distributed coordination,planning, and scheduling systems promise to provide tools for preparingdisaster response plans and for coordinating and monitoring the execution in a more distributed manner.¥resource use modeling. detailed modeling and study of differentdisaster scenarios would give disaster response managers a much betteridea of what resources might be needed, in what quantity, where andhow best to use or deploy them, and so onñfrom items like potablewater for survivors to issues as complex as the most useful deploymentof satellites.¥exploring similarities between transportation networks and it networks.there is some fundamental abstract science common to moving òstuffóbetween nodes in networks, whether it is messages over communications links in a telecommunications network, signals over verylargescale integration circuits

reserved.elements of a research agenda125box 4.6intelligent adaptive planningintelligent adaptive planning breaks down the barriers between preparationand execution; it eliminates the dual problems of creating plans that are not followed and following plans that do not fit. the key aspect of intelligent adaptiveplanning is the ability to gather and assess information speedily from a huge variety of sources, including realtime sensors, and to package and disseminate results so that plans can be executed and changed. intelligent adaptive execution isthe process of modifying a plan to adapt to changed circumstances. there areseveral key requirements, each with potentially fruitful lines of research.one is avoiding thrashingñineffectiveness caused when reacting too quicklyto frequently changing situations sends too many resources toward ephemeralproblems (e.g., food shipments that chase refugees in transit and never catch upwith them). another issue is containment of ripple effects. this is sometimes alsoreferred to as minimal disruption plan repairñisolating parts of a plan so that theexecution of the bulk of a plan can continue without fear that it will impinge on thepart in need of repair. minimal disruption plan repair is extremely important for tworeasons. first, there are computational and organizational costs: the larger thespan of activities that get reconsidered, the greater the time required and the greater the risk of expenses incurred from activities that become subject to revision orcancellation without completion. second, there are human costs which, althoughdifficult to measure, are nevertheless a substantial concernñwhen faced with constantly changing plans, peopleõs morale and performance suffer. in addition, theloss of organizational credibility affects overall performanceñpeople learn to expect changes and wait for their òrealó orders to come rather than acting on therequests received. for all these reasons, thrash avoidance and minimum disruption plan repairs are essential issues.three lines of research have the potential to contribute significantly to addressing these issues. the first applies not at the time of response but ratherduring plan preparation. dependency control essentially augments what good military planners have instinctively done for centuries: attempt to increase the robustness of plans by trying to minimize the number of dependencies among subparts.techniques for providing computational support for this effort range from analytictechniques that attempt to identify alternatives and change plans accordingly, tobruteforce techniques, increasingly enabled by highperformance computing, thatrapidly test alternative plans in simulation against thousands of alternative scenarios in order to see which holds up best. use of these techniques helps ensure thatthe selected plan will work in the greatest number of situations and that problems,if encountered, will be confined to a restricted portion of the plan.the second line of defense against thrashing and disruption comes back tothe topic of uncertainty reasoning. conventional planning and scheduling techniques implicitly assume that the methods selected to perform tasks will succeed.in order to deal with the reality that things often go wrong, human planners (withsome automated assistance) introduce contingency plans and decision points.these essentially attempt to predict where things might go awry, create fallbackplans for addressing these problems, and insert points in the process where activities will halt to allow evaluation of the situation and a choice among the contingencontinuedimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.126improving disaster managementcy plans. although the need for this capability will never go away, uncertainty reasoning can make a great difference. essentially, it allows a system to reason constantly about the probability of success of actions in progress and the degree ofcontribution that those actions will make to the overall outcome. this enables thesystem to put in play multiple alternative methods for ensuring a desired resultñadding more actions if the risk increases, but also cancelling or redirecting some ofthem if the risk decreases. these techniques thus strike an appropriate balancebetween the risks and cost of failure versus the costs of duplicative òinsuranceótasks.the third approach to avoiding thrashing and minimizing disruption investigates stabilitypreserving planning. essentially, much of planning and schedulingis treated as an optimization problem. criteria (often called a utility function) areestablished for defining a ògoodó schedule, and the various algorithms that the fieldhas produced all represent different approaches toward trying to maximize thatscore. in stabilitypreserving planning, rather than planning from scratch, the system takes the preexisting plan as input. mechanisms for expressing the evaluation criteria are extended to permit description of the manner and extent to which auser desires retention of elements in the preexisting plan to be weighted in thegeneration of the revised plan. this is, quite obviously, a highly desirable contribution to minimaldisruption plan repair.combining dependency control, uncertainty reasoning, and stabilitypreserving planning techniques into intelligent adaptive planning systems will greatly increase the power of software systems to help organizations rapidly and effectivelyadapt to changing situations with minimum costs. adaptive capability is most effective when coupled with proactive problemidentification systems based on techniques such as plan sentinels or mathematical progress indicators. these techniques point the way toward earlywarning systems that provide a balance betweenmaximizing the amount of time available to respond to problems with avoidance ofoverreaction to unlikely problems.adaptation is easiest if the initial resource allocation planning is done well.new techniques offer the promise of smarter, more efficient algorithms that canproduce better solutions to larger problems. combined with better allocation algorithms, the concept of òbest available understanding,ó in which the system fills ingaps by combining actual information with predictions and estimates, has the potential to avoid ògarbagein/garbageoutó difficulties by improving the likelihood thatthe problems fed to those improved algorithms best reflect the actual situation.taken together, research in these areas has the promise of building systems5 to 10 years from now that utilize resources far more effectively, recognize andadapt to difficulties and changed situations much earlier, and keep organizationsefficient and credible in the course of doing so.box 4.6 continuedsystem, or people between cities via the air

societal systems to help expose negative interactions and appropriate responses could advance response preparedness by allowing responders to gain òreallifeó experience. thistechnology could also be used to incorporate disaster research into practice as well as provide an environment for testing such research.3¥flexible, embedded, and miniature projective visual displays. the size,weight, and rigidity of existing visual displays (computer screens) cancreate usability problems under field conditions. an emerging generationof materials will permit digital display surfaces that can be flexed, folded,or molded, as circumstances require. possible applications may includefoldable/rollable map displays, fabric displays worn as parts of a uniform, and displays built into the surfaces of structures, vehicles, and roadways. miniature projective displays offer a potential option when dexterity is an issue, such as when wearing gloves. projective displays are smallenough for a cell phone to project an image, such as a map or virtualkeyboard, onto a flat surface. headsup displays, including virtual retinaldisplays using lowpowered lasers, project information directly in theuserõs field of view.¥event replay tools. as disaster management becomes more networkcentric and storage costs decrease, the evolution of disasters (and responses) can be more easily monitored and archived. these capabilitiesallow ongoing replays of what just happened and post facto analysis anddocumentation of lessons learned.¥online repositories of lessons learned. lessons learned in one region ofthe country or in one disaster management domain could be more rapidlyand broadly disseminated if a wellknown searchable repository was setup. the federal governmentõs lessons learned information sharing(www.llis.gov) web site is a first step in this direction.3an example of this technology applied in practice was presented to the committee. seesynthetic environment for analysis and simulation

scalable, survivable data logging. with advances in sensortechnology, it is increasingly feasible to capture data that might be veryuseful in disaster management (e.g., levee saturation levels, building orstructural stresses, and so on). major challenges, however, involve thingslike integrating such data into useful tools, making sure that such datasurvive a given disaster, and archiving the data in such a way that theycan be learned from for future disasters.¥dynamic capability profiling and credentialing. integrated systems forregistering and credentialing people with skills required

text, audio, and video) can all be employed to mobilize volunteers and private voluntary organizations and to provide more usefulinformation to the public. in addition to delivering messages in multiplelanguages, such systems could incorporate visual (e.g., sign language),sound, and tactile communications to reach different specialneedsgroups.¥multimodal public reporting systems. the bestknown example of apublic reporting system is the 911 emergency calling system. it has provedhighly effective as an efficient means for the public to notify public safetyofficials of a situation requiring their attention. enhanced911 (or e911)extends the 911 system to wireless (cellular) devices. while valuable, the911 system is exclusively voicecommunicationsbased. technology isavailable and could be applied to extending public reporting systemsbeyond voice to include text, data, image, video, and so on.¥enhanced twoway communications with the public. technology capabilities are now making it possible to send alerts and warning notifications and instructions to specific geographic areas or entire regions to arange of devices, including cell phones, pagers, computers (email), andwireless pdas. (one current capability of this sort is socalled reverse 911,which provides an automated way of contacting citizens at risk.) this isan important first step in improving twoway communication with thepublic. further advances may allow notices to be finely targeted, withmessages tailored to individuals on the basis of the type of risk, proximityto the hazard, and other important factors. in addition, tools for collectingvoice (e.g., 911), text (e.g., email and sms), and image (e.g., picture phone)may allow systematic incorporation of data reported by the public intothe process of developing a broadbased view of a disaster. perhaps moreimportantly, these systems may eventually enable true risk communications as an interactive process of information exchange between officialsand the public.55national research council, improving risk communication, national academy press,washington, d.c., 1989. this report draws a careful distinction between risk messages andthe risk

enable the public togain a much greater understanding of what to expect in disaster situations and provide insights on how they can best prepare for and participate in disaster response.enhanced infrastructure survivability andcontinuity of societal functions¥mobile power generators. extended widespread disasters stress thepower grid and backup power sources. efficient, compact, and easilydeployed power sources can play a central role in the restoration of communication, the provision of medical services, and so on. while generators are predeployed at many facilities, a system for tracking criticalunmet power needs and distributing power resources can facilitate morerapid recovery.¥communications redundancy. different communication infrastructures are susceptible to different types of failures. having access to different communication technologies increases the chances of being able tocommunicate during or after a disaster. certain wireless technologies(e.g., mesh networking) are especially attractive, since they require littleor no infrastructure, can be power efficient, and can be used to extend thereach of functioning communication infrastructure.¥embedded sensors for nondestructive asset evaluation. one of the challenges after disasters is determining what parts of the physical infrastructure (e.g., buildings, bridges) are safe to use. this often requires a physicalinspection by trained specialists. embedded sensors can speed up theevaluation of physical assets, thus speeding up the recovery process.¥automated monetary disbursement. a major challenge in widespreaddisasters is providing people with financial resources to cope with immediate needs. systems are needed for entering claims, authenticating reimproving

narratives describing fictionaldisasters illustrative of the current and potential use of informationtechnology (it) in disaster management practice. the purpose is to provide a realistic context for understanding and analyzing potential goalsand capabilities for the use of it to improve disaster management nowand in the future. the committee constructed narratives representing different types of disasters with different proximate causes, varying lengthsof warning, different geographic scope, and different levels of responderperspective (local/tactical, regional/strategic and tactical, national/strategic) in order to uncover both common and unique problems that theypresent. the narratives draw on the experiences of disaster managementpractitioners and researchers and highlight specific aspects of technologyuse. each scenario shows elements of it use across the goal areas identified in the report, though a scenario may naturally highlight the importance of some goals more than others. some descriptions may seem morecompelling because they are closer to the direct human impact of a disaster, but gaining an understanding of and improving on disaster management practice at all levels are critical to saving lives and reducing economic impacts. taken together, the scenarios build a picture of the manymoving parts that must be coordinated for an effective response.for each scenario, an introductory paragraph describes the settingand the focus for analysis of it use. each scenario concludes with a summary analysis that highlights some of the challenges and opportunitiesimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.136improving disaster

trouble tracking the people andresources responding into the area. we really need to get a handle onthat. . . .an analysis of this scenario reveals a number of notable problemswith and limitations of it use. these include radiofrequency conflicts;the lack of means for communicating with victims (using either voice ortext) or for obtaining information about them (through automaticallytransmitted sensor data from their devices); impaired video capability;limits of commercial cellular infrastructure; lack of access to redundant oralternate technologies (e.g., text messaging, wireless internet); inability todisseminate and share information; reduced timeliness and limitations ofsensor data; absence of dissemination of sensor data to responders,hazmat units, and hospitals; and inability to distinguish different information needs of various responders. the ability to interpret the data rapidly (either by getting it to the appropriate expert or through automatedanalysis) and then to issue appropriate and timely instructions to responders and affected individuals based on the analysis of the data is clearlycritical. some of these problems and limitations could be addressed withexisting technology; others require technology advances.a striking aspect of the response described is the need to gather anddisseminate information rapidly in order to create sufficient situationalawareness for making effective response decisions in a rapidly evolvingsituation. for instance, chemical sensors started going off only 40 secondsafter the initial report of a casualtyñand yet this was already too late toavoid dispatching responders when they could no longer provide effective aid and to keep doors from opening on entering trains. detection ofharmful agents might, for instance, trigger automated response systemsto halt or reroute the entry of additional trains into the area. automatedanalysis of sensor data could also alert the dispatcher to take appropriatemeasures to protect and direct respondersñnot just to avoid putting themin harmõs way but also to make sure that they could be effective if theywere deployed. other possibilities include automated control of heating,ventilation, and air conditioning systems based on previous plume modeling. understanding what can be automated and striking a balance between what should be automated and what requires human decisionmakers are major challenges revealed by an analysis of this scenario.finally, the scenario does not consider how the increasingly sophisticatedimproving disaster management: the role of it in

carry couldbe used to provide better information about the unfolding incident.the unfolding response to a hurricanethe second fictional narrative describes the development and progression of a major hurricane in the gulf of mexico and the correspondingdisaster management response that is possible now with the current levelof technology. it focuses on the use of information and communicationstechnology from the perspective of the regional emergency operationscenter. the scenario shows how emergency managers use it during thepreincident onset phase, through landfall, to the early stages of postincident recovery. this scenario highlights a number of uses to which itis currently put when responding to situations with considerable warningand slow onset. situational awareness and a common operating pictureare a particular focus. the substantial lead time and detailed knowledgenow available prior to the onset of a hurricane are possible owing to greatadvances in it and other scientific disciplines.the response described here is a mix of tactical and strategic operations. technologies highlighted in this scenario include computer modeling, simulation, weather sensors, satellites, wifi and mobile networking,traffic cameras, and unmanned vehicles with onboard communications.for this scenario, information and communications flows are centeredlargely on the state emergency operations center, with raw data flowingin, being processed, and analyzed; actions being formulated; and instructions flowing back out.a category 4 hurricane is churning in the gulf of mexico, buildingstrength. it is projected to be the worst storm surge ever experienced onthe florida west coast. the hurricane begins to make its way toward cedar key, a sparsely populated area near ocala, with expected landfall onsaturday at midnight. emergency managers develop an incident actionplan (iap) for the response using previous plans and the results of a distributed simulation exercise. iaps are specific to an event. at this point inan event, the communitiesõ and stateõs emergency management plansform the framework of response. this approach allows each agency to seeits role in the plan and identify possible bottlenecks. alternative plans aredeveloped for possible storm deviations.the state emergency manager activates the plan for cedar key basedon computerized weather models showing the highest probability of landfall occurring there. local and state response teams (e.g., search and rescue, law enforcement) are prepositioned near cedar key, and federalteams are prepositioned along the path of the hurricane, which is projectimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of

hurricane warning issued by the national weather service. the weatherservice, taking advantage of a network of wind and wave sensors erectedalong the west coast, begins to see in real time that the port city of tampais unexpectedly bearing the brunt of the storm, indicating that the storm isnot heading north but has turned slightly east, mirroring the behavior ofhurricane charley. the state eoc dynamically switches to an alternativeiap previously developed for this area, using simulations and drawing ona cache of plans from previous responses.based on the alternative plan, the state eoc generates modificationsto the existing response plan, notifying all critical agencies (i.e., those designated in the plans as key agencies for interagency emergency communications and operations), rerouting coast guard flyovers and prioritizingnight flights. the broadcast media interrupts programming to saturate theairwaves with hurricane warnings, and the state communications officesets up a 511 number for information. law enforcement officers are dispatched to close down entertainment areas, alert the areas most at risk,inform them of how to respond, and survey the status of voluntary evacuations, identifying specific highrisk targets such as nursing homes thathave not been evacuated. the department of transportation (dot), another designated critical agency, brings in crews and orange cones to helproute traffic out of the popular bayside night club district. traffic camerasshow realtime traffic flows along designated evacuation routes, and dotforwards assessments to the media for broadcast to the public.the hurricane makes landfall at midnight, but stalls unexpectedly.the weather service projects 18 inches of rain in the tampa bay regionby morning. the rainfall, coupled with the storm surge, could topple thelevees surrounding toxic phosphate mine tailings. the state emergencymanager calls for the deployment of preidentified assets for the largescale testing and monitoring of water quality and designated environmental mitigation teams. eoc staff work through the night with computerprograms projecting damage to key areas, residential areas, and infrastructure; these become rapid reconnaissance plans. intermittent reportsfrom prepositioned recon teams and law enforcement provide some indication of damage, but the winds and rain must die down before the coastguard can fly or reconnaissance teams can venture out. the governorand president are briefed about potential ecological and economic damage, based on models and the current storm path.the hurricane finally passes in the early morning hours, and the windand rain begin to subside. electric power and cellular coverage were lostearly on due to wind damage from the leading edge of

managementsatellite phones are waiting for the skies to clear. recon and responseteams are set to mobilize at 4 a.m. teams have refined their plans throughout the night, generating search grids for the area, reviewing land usemaps, and assigning teams and assets. as they begin to deploy to thefield, they find it difficult to reach designated areas due to extensive damage to transportation infrastructure. limited ability to communicate difficulties and receive updated damage information further hinders progress.a large neighborhood near downtown is flooded, and survivors are onthe roofs, while a major senior and assistedliving development in the suburbs previously identified as not having been evacuated is also damagedand flooded. rescue teams deploy miniature unmanned helicopters togeolocate survivors on roofs, remotely talk with them, and also look aroundroofs and attics for signs of survivors trapped inside. the coast guardsends manned helicopters to the suburbs to lift survivors from the rooftops, while the rescue teams talk directly with the pilots and provide prioritization and data on rooftop conditions from a portable anemometer. themajority of the rescue teams focus on determining who in the urban areaneeds immediate evacuation. when the rescuers find a group of looters,they alert the police, who in turn dispatch the nearest law enforcementpersonnel. boats are tasked to help the elderly and handle medical priorities, but routing them to appropriate care facilities is hampered by damage infrastructure making it impossible to regularly communicate information about the operational status of medical facilities.as operations transition slowly from response to recovery, law enforcement agencies attempt to separate curious bystanders from returningauthorized responders, residents, and repair crews. but, due to limitedmeans to make such distinctions, they tend to deny access to some appropriate personnelñslowing the repair and recovery process. utility providers (e.g., electrical, water, communications) gather information about damage and determine how to reestablish services. portable radio broadcasttowers are erected and by 7 a.m., news and response directions are beingtransmitted to the public in the affected areas. while the eoc has a general picture of where resources have been dispatched and has piecedtogether an overall picture of damage from information coming from fieldoperations, detailed situational awareness continues to be elusive.information and communications technology is obviously critical tomanaging the widely distributed and massive operations described inthis scenario. indeed, it is used effectively from identification of theemerging situation through to the recovery phase. lives are saved, damaged reduced, and steps toward recovery made rapidly by extensive useof it. yet, there are many opportunities to extend and improve the use ofit. a combination of existing

phase. interagency communicationand coordination are especially critical in this scenario, and the planningoperations described stress this point.however, the single global situational awareness developed at theeoc is inadequate for developing the taskspecific situational awarenessneeded by different participants. for instance, a searchandrescue teamincident commander should see where search teams are, what they havesearched, and what the results are. he or she would have the ability toreport looting or unauthorized entry to law enforcement, using authorized access to directly input the information into the system managingthe operational picture. the medical community should also see theprogress and projections of injuries, heatstroke, local capacity for medicalcare, and so onñand be able to send information about its situation toother operational units for (automatic) inclusion into their operationalpicture. the eoc should receive continuously updated information thatcan then be used to revise its operational picture on an ongoing basisusing adaptive planning tools.while transportation officials are able to identify traffic congestionusing cameras and to communicate problems that have already developed, use of traffic sensors that measure speed and volume of trafficcould be incorporated with information about infrastructure damage andother situational variables into decision support systems to recommendalternate routes proactively before the transportation system bogs down.civilian volunteers at homes and shelters, fire departments, and policestations could be preequipped with wifi network capability and designated as an integral information source in emergency plans. civilians inthe damaged areas with functioning it systems (e.g., cell phones) couldhave a channel for sending pictures and other information from areas to adesignated repository that can be used to build situational awareness.with technology available and on the horizon, it is possible to imagine rescue teams, as they drive into designated areas, receiving constantupdates from dot reconnaissance teams on road conditions and damage. a roadmap on a responder laptop could glow with red overlays onknown or suspected damaged bridges. navigation software could attemptto create directions for each of the teams that would get them to theirassigned grid. driving in, a team member could use infrared and lasercameras to videorecord the geolocated damage. as a team passed a wifihot spot, the laptop could download new information from flyovers, andthe weather service could transmit video to the incident commander on apriority basis and then to the eoc. decision support tools could begincombing emerging information, correlating and analyzing who needsimproving disaster

area and the resulting response. the focusis on the use of information and communications technology from theperspective of the federallevel emergency manager as part of a nationalresponse. in this case onset is rapid, but such an incident has been anticipated, and detailed plans exist for responding to it. the blizzard of acronyms blanketing this scenario is a clue to the complexity involved incoordinating a response at this level and the degree and sophistication ofinteragency interaction required. resource allocation, logistics, tracking,and mobilization are of particular concern in this scenario. planning triggers, such as the declaration of an incident of national significance, alsoaffect what it resources are applied and when. most of the technologyemployed in the two fictional scenarios above would also be applied inthis scenario. however, technologies (and issues) highlighted here arethose focused primarily on strategic response: for example, collaborationtools, modeling, information analysis and filtering tools, logistics andtracking, system scalability, and geographic information systems (gis).at 4:03 a.m. on a monday in march, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake occurs on the hayward fault, with an epicenter very near the university ofcalifornia, berkeley. the hayward fault event is not unanticipated and hasbeen studied by scientists and emergency managers for years. however,in the darkness and confusion surrounding the early hours, it is difficult toget an accurate picture about what has just occurred.state office of emergency management (oem)

damaged in the bay area, primarily in alameda and san francisco counties. the models predict thatalmost 400,000 people will be displaced and will need food and water, and110,000 will need emergency shelter. oakland and san francisco airportsand the port of oakland are expected to be closed, as are major interstatehighways (i80, i580, i880, highway 13, highway 101) and bridges (baybridge, dumbarton bridge, richmondðsan rafael bridge). models developed by the university of california, berkeley, predict severe damage tothat institution. significant casualties are also expected.the information from the models is enough for the secretary of dhs todeclare an incident of national significance, to activate the catastrophicincident annex of the national response plan, and to deploy specializedresources. resources deployed include rapid needs assessment teams,fema advance teams, urban search and rescue teams (usart), national disaster medical system (ndms) teams, and disaster mortuaryteams. the mobilization of government and red cross resources is alsobegun.the common operating picture and situational awareness problemsbegin almost immediately. due to bridge and highway failures and communications problems, the bay area has been transformed into four or fivedisconnected òislands,ó complicating coordinated response efforts. initialcommunications with fema region nine are restricted to satellite phone.although travis air force base is open, it is not clear to emergency managers where the greatest needs are and how to bring resources to bear tomeet them.rain and fog impede overflights and generation of satellite imagery inthe hours immediately following the incident. scattered reports from citizens, media, and responders from the area are conflicting and vague. forexample, reports have been received that the bay bridge is òdown,ó but noone in washington, d.c., or sacramento knows if that means that thebridge has collapsed, a section has collapsed (as occurred during theloma prieta earthquake), or an onramp is closed. similarly, unconfirmedreports have been received from the media that there are òthousandsó ofcasualties at the university of california, berkeley, and that people aretrapped in collapsed buildings in oakland.in washington, d.c., the dhs homeland security operations center(hsoc), the fema national response coordination center (nrcc), andthe white house homeland security council (hsc) have delivered conflicting initial assessments to the president: fema nrccõs assessment isbased on hazus model output; dhs hsocõs

operationally, but not physically, combined after hurricane katrina into the national operations center(noc). the berkeley earthquake is demonstrating that the two operationscenters are still operating independently. the secretary of dhs has convened his interagency incident advisory council (iac) and is receivinginformation directly from senior officials in other cabinet offices. for instance, health and medical information, including the status of medicalassets in the region, is processed through the department of health andhuman services (dhhs) eoc. the presidentõs homeland security advisorhas convened the domestic readiness group (drg) to provide policyadvice to the president and to the secretary of dhs.even after communications are established, the situational awarenessproblems persist. the homeland security information network (hsin),developed to provide uniform, richer, informationsharing capabilities andcollaborative tools, has been overwhelmed. information available throughhsin is not qualitychecked and is inconsistent, inaccurate, and incomplete. the information available is changing rapidly, and it is difficult todetermine the source or timeliness of the information. in particular, gisimagery is available on hsin from several sources (state of california,u.s. geological survey, fema), and different images convey different information. no process exists for updating and datestamping situationalinformation as reports from the field groundtruth initial estimates producedby models, media, and rapid needs assessment teams. in particular, thestatus of critical infrastructure (e.g., road closures, water availability, sanitation) is difficult to determine, since reports are using nonstandard, nontechnical, and inconsistent language.first responders and infrastructure managers, engaged in critical lifesafety and lifeline repair tasks, cannot provide consistent or complete information. managers in the noc are suffering from information overloadand are beginning to narrow their focus to one or two sources of situationalinformation (often cnn and one source from the field), a typical humanresponse. hsoc is relying on reports from the state oem, and the nrccis relying on the fema advance emergency response team. the predesignated federal coordinating officer has been briefed by the nrccand has been deployed to travis, as have the predesignated primaryfederal official (after briefings from dhs hsoc) and the predesignateddefense coordinating officer (after briefings from northcom).the white house drg is collecting information from all availablesources. on day 2, as a joint field office (jfo) and unified federal/statecommand is established in sacramento, it is apparent that the operatingpicture of the president, the secretary of dhs, the governor, the pfo, thefco, and responders on the ground in the bay area is not yet a commonone. it is also clear that even where there is a common understanding ofimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix a149situational information, substantial differences exist in meaning attributedto that information depending upon the background, experience, and organizational responsibilities of the manager/decision maker.for fema, the american red cross, northcom, and the u.s. armycorps of engineers, this is the largest mobilization and deployment of people and resources since hurricane katrina. the corps has activated itscontracts with vendors and has ordered hundreds of truckloads of bottledwater and ice. new radiofrequency identification (rfid) systems will trackthe relief commodities from the point of manufacture, to federal warehousesites, and to state and local distribution sites. attempts will be made by thecorps to ensure that dhs and fema have access to this logistics information to enable them to assess the gap between needs and supply. femahas activated prescripted mission assignments with the national communication system (for cell on wheels and switches on wheels to restore cellphone communication systems) and with dod (for navy vessels for shelter and command support, for army and air force logistics, and for troopsto assist the california national guard).the american red cross is mobilizing 50,000 volunteers using itsdisaster services human resource system, and fema has mobilized anddeployed its disaster reserve corps. northcom has established jointtask force california to manage the influx of department of defense resources. fema has activated its national emergency management information system (nemis) and its call centers to create the ability to registerdisaster victims for individual assistance. nemis has been dramaticallyexpanded since it collapsed during hurricane katrina, but it has not beentested. as day 3 progresses, dhs, fema, and white house managerscontinue struggling to determine both what the situation is on the groundand to assess the adequacy of the response resources on scene andresources in the pipeline.the scenario above exposes the complexity involved in coordinatingnumerous agencies at all levels, with often widely overlapping and conflicting responsibilities but different perspectives. those perspectives aswell as organizational culture and instincts affect how information is interpreted, what information is trusted, and even where information issought. this has profound implications for decision support tools, logistics, and resource allocation systems. one specific implication is how itsystems deal with incomplete or uncertain information and how suchinformation is presented to disaster managers. another is integration ofand coordination with civilians and ad hoc groups in this environment.how can the volunteer groups that stand up be integrated and coordinated? the scenario illustrates the extent to which hierarchical commandand control are assumed in organizational structures and how that isimproving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright

and cultural innovations necessary to leverage themñconstitutes a major challenge for making use of advances in it.the dependence on models for rapid initial deployment is an especially striking aspect of this scenario. aggregating the status informationfrom fema, dhs, the red cross, dhhs, and dod logistics and humanresource systems is particularly difficult. without a significant level ofconfidence in status information, managers cannot be sure that they knowwhat impacts have occurred, what resources are needed, or what resources are responding. models could also be valuable to responders andother onthescene personnel whose perspective might lead to insightsnot necessarily accessible to more distant emergency managers. however, this level of sharing is not typical. also, modeling results are notoften shared with lowerlevel personnel, who might be able to act moreefficiently if they were. finding ways to give more people access to modeling systems could yield significant benefits.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recoverycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.151breview of interoperability initiativesanumber of initiatives and programs at the federal, state, andlocal levels have worked to improve interoperability. some 60agencies and programs deal with various aspects of interoperablecommunications and are spread throughout the federal government, state,regional, and local agencies as well as public safety associations.one major federal program, started in early 2001, was the nationalinstitute of justiceõs (nijõs) advanced generation of interoperability forlaw enforcement (agile) program, now the commtech program.agile was established as a comprehensive program to concentrate onthe need for improved public safety communications and informationsharing to address the requirement for effective coordination, communication, and sharing of information among numerous criminal justice andpublic safety agencies. three research areas identified as being of generalinterest to the agile program reflect a focus on both data and voiceinteroperability: 1¥information sharingñaddress technological and policy obstacles toenable effective and efficient, ondemand sharing of database information in a regional area;1national institute of justice, òcommunications interoperability and information sharing technologies (agile r&d) program solicitation,ó washington, d.c., june 2001, p. 2;available at

video, using common standards and open architecture techniques;¥voice communicationsñability to overcome disparate bands, frequencies, and waveform generation techniques to enable regional voicecommunications interoperability for daytoday and mutual aid situations.in october 2001, the nij sponsored the national public safety wireless interoperability forum. the goals of the forum were to raise publicsafety wireless interoperability to the national level and to give forumparticipants the opportunity to develop a list of actions that could betaken to overcome the policy barriers to improving public safety wirelesscommunications.2 the forumõs success led to the creation of the nationaltask force on interoperability (ntfi).in february 2003, ntfiña task force comprising members from 18national associations, state and local elected and appointed officials, andpublic safety officialsñissued a guide for public officials entitled òwhycanõt we talk?ó that reiterated and extended the work done by the publicsafety wireless advisory committee. the ntfi guide states that the inability of public safety officials to communicate with one anotheròthreatens the publicõs safety and often results in unnecessary loss of livesand property.ó3 it does note the importance of data communicationsinteroperability, particularly the need for interagency planning and coordination to achieve it. however, the primary focus is voice communications, and it is emphasized that a lack of adequate spectrum for publicsafety communications is one of the major barriers to interoperable communications.although it continues to receive considerable attention, adequatespectrum is not the only (or even the most important) requirement forinteroperable communications. the definition of public safety wirelesscommunications interoperability developed by the ntfi and refined bysafecom, a program of the department of homeland securityõs (dhsõs)office for interoperability and compatibility, describes interoperabilityas òthe ability of emergency response officials to share information via2see the national institute of justiceõs information on the national task force on

asauthorized.ó4the ntfi guide identifies five key barriers to public safety communications interoperability:¥incompatible and aging communications equipment,¥limited and fragmented budget cycles and funding,¥limited and fragmented planning and coordination,¥limited and fragmented radio spectrum, and¥limited equipment standards.the summit on interoperable communications for public safety, heldin june 2003, was a joint effort among the national institute of standardsand technology (nist), dhsõs safecom program, and nijõs agileprogram. the summit, which brought together a variety of participantsfrom federal, state, and national programs created to assist public safetypractitioners, produced a briefing book listing the various programs andagencies at all levels of government involved in ongoing interoperabilityefforts.5 the summit was intended as the initial step in familiarizing keyinteroperability players with the work being done by others so that mutually beneficial coordination and collaboration among the various technical programs could be established. the summit was also meant to provideinsight into where additional federal resources might be warranted andto help stakeholders maximize the limited resources available across allgovernment levels by leveraging program successes and developing standards, approaches, products, and services for the benefit of all.one of the clear messages from the summit was that interoperabilityshould be built from the bottom up. that is, interoperation of communications must be built starting at the state, local, and regional levels withguidance and support coming from the federal level. under this framework, federal programs such as dhsõs safecom and nijõs commtechsee their role as assisting state and local law enforcement agencies tocommunicate effectively and efficiently with one another across agencyand jurisdictional boundaries.64see

dhs s&t directorateõs office for interoperabilityand compatibility (oic) is to serve as the overarching program withindhs to strengthen and integrate interoperability efforts that improvepublic safety preparedness and response at all levels. oic responsibilitiesinclude the following:¥support the creation of interoperability standards;¥establish a comprehensive research, development, testing, andevaluation program;¥identify and certify all dhs programs that involve interoperabilityissues;¥integrate coordinated grant guidance;¥oversee the development and implementation technical assistance;¥conduct pilot demonstrations of technology;¥create an interagency interoperability coordination council; and¥establish an effective outreach program.oic created the umbrella program safecom to coordinate the efforts of public safety agencies at all levels of government in order toimprove public safety response through more effective, efficient,interoperable wireless communications. safecom has developed a number of tools and documents for public safety officials, including theinteroperability continuum framework for addressing critical wirelessinteroperability elements; the statewide communications interoperabilityplanning (scip) methodology; grant guidance, which includes guidelinesfor implementing a wireless communication system; and, in conjunctionwith the nij, a statement of requirements (sor) for interoperability.7recent activity undertaken to carry out that mission includes the following:¥creation of the federal interagency coordination council (ficc)to coordinate funding, technical assistance, standards development, andregulations affecting communications and interoperability across the federal government;¥publication of a statement of requirements that defines, for the firsttime, what it will take to achieve full interoperability and provides industry requirements against which to map product capabilities;¥issuance of a request for input from the public safety community7details on the safecom program are available at http://www.safecomprogram.gov/safecom.improving disaster management: the role of it in mitigation, preparedness,

agencies will work within that framework.a number of states and regions have undertaken a variety of initiatives to achieve interoperable wireless communications among agenciesin their areas. virginia worked with safecom and the nij to develop astrategic plan for improving statewide interoperable communications. thelessons from this effort were used by safecom to create the scip methodology.the ntfi identified a number of state and regional wireless voicecommunications interoperability efforts, including the capital wirelessintegrated network (capwin), which is a partnership between the stateof maryland, the commonwealth of virginia, and the district of columbia to develop an interoperable first responder data communication andinformation sharing network; the state of south dakota radio system,which includes everything from the wireless infrastructure to radios usedin statewide communications; and the state of indiana radio system (hoosier safet), which provides statewide wireless infrastructure for voicecommunications. other initiatives include the minnesota metropolitanpublic safety radio system, public safety radio interoperability in colorado, state of north carolina interoperability initiatives, and the utahcommunications agency network.8 the nature of these efforts varies depending on the unique situation of the locality, region, or state.8national task

considerable effort within the public safety community. femaõs disaster management egov initiative and its disastermanagement interoperability services (dmis)9 provide a set of servicesand software tools to public safety agencies for enabling responders toshare information seamlessly between organizations. the global justicexml data model (gjxdm) and the derivative dhs national informationexchange model (niem) are intended as data reference models for theexchange of information within the justice and public safety communities.10 overarching efforts such as the federal enterprise architectureand the eauthentication egov program also address information sharing and data exchange at the federal level.11industryled efforts at data communications interoperability includethe ieee 1512 standards program, oriented to transportation incidentmanagement, and the ieee 1451 program for sensor integration standards.12 international efforts that span the government, private, and opensource communities include the organization for the advancement ofstructured information standards emergency management technicalcommittee, developers of the common alerting protocol and the emergency data exchange language; and the open gis consortium, creatorsof geospatial markup language and of the web map service and webfeature service specifications, among others.two
