 finally, at the epigenetic level, each cell type has a different methylation signature that characterizes that cell type. however, there is a semifluid modulation of methylation signatures that characterizes each cell which is a result of all the epigenetic changes that have occurred since fertilization and the current tissue niche in which that cell resides. the unique cellular signature of an individual can alter owing to diet, age, stress, drugs and so forth. hence, at the methylation coalface, we face a far more interesting and complex clinical situation than the current emphasis on hardware changes such as mutations, snps, and gross genomic imbalances, since methylation signatures are dynamic and context dependent. they provide snapshots of the current network status and hence of our current cellular operating systems. the rewards of rigorous bioinformatic analyses in this sphere are likely to be profound.

(sackler nas colloquium) frontiers of bioinformatics: unsolved problems and challengescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.38 control screens were then performed. positive controls composed of ser/thr pks of available experimental 3d structures, and negative controls composed of proteins known not to bind atp, also with available experimental 3d structures, were subjected to the screening procedure. both yielded the expected results, albeit with a small proportion of false negatives, and an even smaller proportion of false positives.  the 400 previously unknown and unannotated proteins of d. discoideum were then chosen as the pilot test set. two binding site motifs were deduced from the ser/thr pk training set, one with the two ribose hydroxyls ﬁboundﬂ to a single protein residue centroid (type 1), and a second where the two hydroxyls are separately ﬁboundﬂ (type 2). screening the test set for the ser/thr atp binding site motif type 1, our program detected 32 putative atpbinding proteins, which on closer human inspection, revealed that only 15 are true positives. screening for type 2, the program picked up 25 putatives, which on closer inspection revealed that all but 1 may be false positives. it now remains to be seen whether the 16 true positives (15 type 1 and 1 type 2) picked up by our program above indeed bind atp via actual laboratory experimental techniques.  interestingly, our program did not detect any putative campdependent pk nor abc transporter from the test set. this may be due to the fact that the training sets for these two families each contained only one member (as those were the only ones available from the pdb), making the screen overly specific and therefore quite insensitive.  similar work on gtp is underway. we are also currently trying to incorporate all the different programs for all the different steps in the entire procedure into one main calling script in order to streamline the screening procedure and make it less dependent on human intervention, and therefore more amenable to complete automation, and, in turn, more suited to largescale, wholeproteome screening.
