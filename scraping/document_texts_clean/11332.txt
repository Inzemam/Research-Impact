electronicrecords archives (era) program in 1998 to create a system to preserve and provide access tofederal electronic records. early steps in the era program included naraõs exploration ofpossible solutions and its undertaking of development projects with partners, including thesan diego supercomputer center, the university of maryland, and the georgia tech researchinstitute. in 2004, nara released the final version of its era request for proposals (rfp) andselected two contractors to develop designs for the era.the first report1 of the national research councilõs committee on digital archiving andthe national archives and records administration and its subsequent letter report2 providedrecommendations on design, engineering, and related issues facing the era program, whichwas being conceived at the time of their writing. although some of the reportsõ conclusionsrelate to specific development initiatives and early design ideas, most of the observationsabout archive system design are not tied to these specifics and should remain useful to naraas it develops, refines, and iterates the era program. the òsummary and recommendationsóchapter of the committeeõs first report is reprinted in appendix b of the present report, and its2003 letter report is reprinted in appendix c.the era program has been involved in procurement activities, but this committee has notbeen given access to information about the era design since the issuance of the era programõsrfp, and this report does not containñor comment onñtechnical details about the currentsystem designs. the committee does urge that nara find a mechanism, consistent with1national research council. 2003. building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for

a comprehensive outside technical review of the eradesigns that are proposed by its contractors. the committeeõs first report recommended thatnara establish an ongoing advisory group on digital preservation and information technology (it) system design; such a body might be charged with carrying out a review of this type.this final report focuses on longerterm, more strategic issues that are related to electronicrecords archiving at nara, including technology and other trends that shape the context inwhich the era exists, the archival processes of the era itself, and the future evolution of theera system. in addition, it addresses an important set of technical and design issues associated with assuring record integrity and authenticity that were not covered in detail in thecommitteeõs earlier reports.nara recognizes that it faces a significant challenge. the era program, the recordsmanagement redesign initiative, and naraõs work on records management under the egovernment initiative led by the office of management and budget all reflect naraõs awareness of these problems and represent positive steps in starting to address them. as the findings and recommendations below indicate, electronic records represent both a substantialchallenge and a significant opportunity for nara.the committeeõs findings and recommendations are organized under and support thefollowing six highlevel recommendations:1. get ready for a rapidly rising tide of electronic records.2. plan for continuing technology change and increasing user expectations.3. reengineer relations with federal agencies to help them create records that are archiveready.4. do not assume that era is unique: become more involved with other organizations thathave interests in preserving electronic records.5. learn how to exploit the enthusiasm and capabilities of the research community andwork with others who do that well.6. take strong measures internally and provide governmentwide leadership to ensurerecord integrity and provenance.these recommendations are discussed in more detail below.recommendation 1. plan for a rising tide of electronic recordsfinding 1.1 within a short time, the vast majority of records will be electronic. the volumeof records and the challenge of preserving them will continue to grow significantly.four technology effects are creating an avalanche of digital materials: the growing fractionof information that is born digital and not systematically retained on paper, the relative easeand inexpensiveness of recording information digitally compared with the effort and cost ofrecording it on paper, the advent of new technologies for communicating and recording information, and the decreasing cost of storage, which drives the retention of information thatpreviously would have been discarded.it is reasonable to expect that the growth in the amount of digital information produced insociety at large will likewise occur in governmentñand thus the growth in the volume ofpermanent records. the volume of data to be stored will also grow because individual recordsbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations3will continue to become larger. in addition, the total number and variety of record data types3that must be stored by nara and other repositories will increase over time as new versions ofexisting types are created and entirely new ones are invented.recommendation 1.1 the national archives and records administration (nara) shoulddevote a significant and growing fraction of its attention and resources to electronic records,especially in the areas of records management, appraisal, and transfer of records to nara.a rapid shift to electronic records has two important implications. first, as the findingsand recommendations below detail, many of the processes associated with appraisal, scheduling, ingest (i.e., intake of records and associated metadata), and access will require majormodification in order to accommodate the volume of electronic records expected. second, asthe share of records that are electronic continues to grow rapidly, the relative resources allocated for their management compared with resources for managing traditional records willneed to grow as well. over the coming decade or so, electronic records will become theprimary line of business for nara rather than a side activity. this change will have implications for naraõs organizational culture, structure, and staffing.finding 1.2 new forms of records will emerge as electronic systems capture new kinds ofinformation that may also constitute essential evidence.the way that government conducts its business has been transformed by the pervasive useof electronic systems. as those systems evolve, so too will the types of records that must behandled by nara. certainly, a great many formal government communications continue touse familiar, traditional records: forms, memoranda, pictures, and so on. but other types ofinformation that could well be deemed òessential evidenceó4 are also being captured byelectronic systems. they include new forms of communication, dynamically generated information, and transactions. saving the potentially huge amounts of data associated with thesenew types of information, recreating the behavior of old it systems decades later, and establishing what should be retained as a permanent record are all extremely difficult challenges.recommendation 1.2 nara should develop the capacity to predict and anticipate significant changes in record types and volume, styles of record keeping, and concepts of whatshould be preserved as a permanent record as well as the implications of such changes forfuture versions of the electronic records archives (era).sustained growth in record volume, the continual introduction of new record types, newforms of record keeping, and new concepts of what constitutes a record mean that nara willneed the knowledge and agility to respond in a timely and effective manner so that it can makenecessary changes to its systems and processes and so that it can advise and influence agenciesas they implement new systems. to stay abreast of developments, nara does not needdetailed surveys, which are costly and difficult to conduct, but it does need to develop thecapacity internally and externally (e.g., through research activities or advisory committees) to3òdata typesó is a more general term than òfile formats,ó although the latter may be more familiar.4òthe mission of the national archives and records administration is to ensure, for the citizen and the publicservant, for the president and the congress and the courts, ready access to essential evidence.ó national archivesand records administration (nara). 2003. ready access to essential evidence:

data types, information production rates, and similar trends throughout society and within government.recommendation 2. plan for continuing technology changeand rising user expectationsbecause plans at the outset are for the era to operate for a long time, considerable technology change will occur over the course of its existence. the committee does not have a crystalball allowing it to see far into the technology future, but past experience does suggest somerelevant technology trends that are likely to persist, as described below. technology changeswill, in turn, fuel user expectations: as new technology yields new capabilities that are deployed in systems outside nara, users will expect the era to keep up. these expectationsare also considered below.finding 2.1 sustained performance improvements in the eraõs component technologieswill continue indefinitely.although precise changes in the eraõs component technologies cannot be predicted, somegeneral trends are apparent. for example, as in the past, new forms of storage providing suchdesired characteristics as higher volumetric density, lower cost, and faster access times willcontinue to emerge, and the commercial market will move toward these new technologies. also,the familiar trends of everfaster processors and networks will continue, making costeffectivenetwork transfer and processing of everlarger volumes of records possible. the past 20 yearshave seen sustained improvements in computing performance in many different respects, andthere is no reason to suppose that such sustained improvements will not continue.recommendation 2.1 because radical changes in information technology cannot be specifically anticipated, the era should be designed for change.the continuous and significant change in technology capabilities into the indefinite futuremeans that flexibility in the design of the electronic records archives will be essential. thecommitteeõs first report stressed the need for a modular design for the era to allow components to evolve or to be replaced incrementallyñadvice that remains critical for the success ofthe eraõs initial design and future evolution. as the era evolves, improving its ability tochange should be a major objective. for example, use of commercial offtheshelf technologyshould be emphasized for the era, and era software should be written to be as portable aspossible across offerings of different computer and storage vendors. because network interfaces and protocols are likely to remain relatively stable, the era should conform to prevailing network standards. the era should also be designed to be readily extensibleñthat is, toaccommodate change such as the introduction of new record formats without requiring immediate or widespread modification of the system.finding 2.2 the gains of new technologies will be highly skewed toward highervolumeproducts.certain computer technologies, such as ata/ide5 disk drives and ethernet networks, arehighvolume, lowcost products for which the costperformance ratio steadily improves. these5the customary industry shorthand for a family of harddrive interface standards (ata, advanced technologyattachment; ide, integrated drive electronics); see also the subsection entitled òexploiting the commercial mainstreamó in chapter 1.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations5products generally conform to de facto industry standards that have a relatively long lifetime,and backward compatibility is generally provided across several product generations. lowvolume products, in contrast, rarely exhibit sustainable costperformance characteristics andoften disappear rapidly from use. todayõs trend in moving to disk from tape for mass storageis an example of what often happens in such cases, with a very high volume product replacinga relatively low volume product.recommendation 2.2 components of the era should evolve in step with prevailing commercial trends.the era will benefit from continuing technology evolution only if the era implementation stays roughly in step with mainstream commercial trends. nara should therefore usehighvolume products wherever possible. the functions of the era are not uncommon enoughto support the use of unique hardware or software components; using such componentswould expose nara to the risk of significantly greater costs and more difficult system evolution. nara should be wary of specialpurpose solutions that do not enjoy the benefits ofcontinuous technology improvements driven by a large and active community of users. theera program should plan and budget for renovations of both hardware and software to stayon the technology curve of mainstream it.finding 2.3 fullcontent search, information retrieval, and information extraction offerinexpensive and reasonable, albeit imperfect, capabilities today for textual materials.one of the major challenges for the era system is that of ingesting the anticipated volumeof records without being bogged down by the human effort associated with producing thepurely descriptive metadata that have historically been important for finding records. realistically, there are unlikely to be enough resources (people or dollars) to rely on anything otherthan computerbased algorithms for this purpose.one approach to reducing this burden is fullcontent searching. there has been considerable progress in this areañthat an enormous body of publicly accessible web pages anddocuments of multiple data types can be searched effectively by search engines such as googleis a major achievement of relevance to nara. furthermore, there is widespread demand forbetter searching technologies.another approach is to use informationretrieval techniques such as the family of techniques for automatic metadata extraction. these methods, which make use of informationextraction techniques to extract metadata from the content of records, have reached a level ofmaturity that permits them to be used in production systems; the techniques will continue toimprove steadily, but no breakthroughs are on the horizon. informationextraction techniquesdo not and will not provide the accuracy of a human. nevertheless, they are much less expensive than manual processing is, and in some instances the margin of error they provide may beacceptable to nara (and to naraõs customers, who may be more interested in having rapidaccess to a larger universe of archived records than in high precision). for the foreseeablefuture, automatic metadata extraction will need to be combined with expert guidance toachieve usable results.importantly, as is true with the provision of search capabilities, automatic metadataextraction need not be performed at ingest of records. the highest priority at ingest iscapturing the records along with metadata that are not discernible from the content; theextraction of additional metadata can be deferred and can of course be repeatedly applied astechniques improve.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.6building an electronic records archive at narafinding 2.4 there is no general technical solution for the digital preservation problemtoday, and one is unlikely to appear any time soon.as discussed in the committeeõs first report, the ability to create, store, and retrieve the bitsthat represent a record is a fundamental requirement of the era. good implementations ofthis capability will be quite complex and will require refinement and evolution over time.however, the basic requirements for this part of the era are fairly well understood, andtechnologies exist or are being developed to satisfy most of them.ensuring that bits can be understood by systems and by human beings in the distant futureis much more difficult, however. the committeeõs first report, citing the imperative of makingsignificant progress toward implementing an archival system, proposed a pragmatic, shortterm strategy. but as development of the era proceeds, nara will need to seek out longerterm solutions.for the long term, no generally applicable technical solution is evident. no single proposed approach to digital preservation, including migration, migration to durable fixed formats, or emulation, will work in all cases. each method has its advantages; each has drawbacks and associated costs. one cannot know with any great certainty which proposed methodsfor preserving the interpretability of digital objects into the distant future will subsequently bedeemed successful, much less relatively costeffective. preservation will therefore require acombination of approaches. selecting the appropriate preservation techniques is part of theexpertise that will be required of electronic records archivists. there will be a need for compromises based on user requirements and varying levels of service that nara provides fordifferent records.the preservation problem is unlikely ever to be completely solved. instead, our understanding will grow over time in it areas that become relatively stable, such as relationaldatabases and geographic information systems, and as digital preservation increasingly becomes a mainstream activity. in spite of this growth in understanding, new problems will ariseas novel record data types emerge.there is, however, a significant opportunity for nara to ease some preservation problems by helping promote the development and adoption of formats that have desired attributes for preservation. these attributes include public specifications, broad applicability,compatibility with priorformat versions, and stability. nara has already been involved inthe development of one such format, the nascent portable document format (pdf)/a standard. nara will need to determine and periodically amend the list of formats that it preferentially supports and work to ensure that recordcreating agencies provide records in thesesupported formats. this is an important part of ensuring that records are created archiveready (see recommendation 3.1).finding 2.5 user expectations will be high and will continue to grow as the capabilitiesoffered by other information technology (it) services improve.users are likely to expect nara to keep pace with the aggressive rate of improvementsthat they see in commercial online services. also, it is reasonable to expect that users will wantappropriate transformation and processingñsuch as conversion from persistent forms intoeasily usable formsñand not just access to raw data. in other words, users will expect serviceswell beyond the simple delivery of static records.given its limited resources, nara cannot afford to meet all of these expectations for allbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations7records. expectations will need to be reconciled with the notion of varying levels of service fordifferent record types. one such adjustment would be to make all records easily accessible eventhough they were not all equally easy to view or process. another approach would be to enablethird parties to meet the requirements of users who have special retrieval or processing needs orwho must work with infrequently used document formats (see recommendation 4.1).recommendation 3. reengineer processes to accommodatechallenges and opportunities presented by electronic recordsif nara and federal agencies do not succeed in transforming their approach to transferring permanent records for preservation, the probable result will be significant difficulty inacquiring the desired permanent records and a costly, laborintensive effort applied to thoserecords that are acquired. as the subrecommendations below detail, nara should thereforeestablish procedures and systems to ingest new records automatically on a routine basis,capture metadata at or close to record creation, take steps to increase the likelihood thatrecords are provided archiveready, and use automatic techniques to supply missing metadata.in implementing the recommendations below, nara should determine the areas in whichexisting law and regulations provide sufficient flexibility and those in which changes to thepolicies governing records management may be required.finding 3.1 the growing volume of electronic records will swamp a system that relies onmanual processing.as the volume of electronic records to be stored in the era grows (recommendation 1),existing processes, which rely on manual handling of records, will cease to be costeffective, oreven feasible. affordability requires automation. it is, for example, not feasible to manuallysupply additional metadata about ingested records except at a very coarse level of granularity.finding 3.2 preparation for the ingest of electronic records closer to their creation will makearchiving easier, cheaper, and more accurate.the ingest of electronic records decades after their creation could be problematic. this isbecause obsolete data and metadata formats may be difficult to interpret, and it may be quitedifficult to modify the systems in which the records reside in order to facilitate ingest.there are two very similar techniques for addressing this problem: a passive one, in whichnara is sent records early, on a provisional basis, and carries out a òdry runó of ingest; andan active one, in which nara actually ingests records in anticipation of a future transfer ofcustody to nara. both give early warning of potential problems with ingest. although theactive mode gives nara the most information about the records that it will have to handle, itis probably harder for agencies (and nara) to implement. on the other hand, the resultingarchival copies might also provide additional incentives for agencies to support the creation ofarchiveready records and their delivery to nara, as the era could provide offsite backupof agency records.finding 3.3 automated ingest depends on records being provided in structured, standardized formats together with sufficiently standardized essential metadata.without some degree of standardization in the essential metadata (metadata that cannotbe derived from the record itself through information extraction or search), the ingest of eachbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.8building an electronic records archive at naraset of records will require significant, costly human intervention. nonetheless, nara and theera system will have to be flexible in accepting records from originating agenciesñthat is,neither nara processes nor the era design should be brittle with respect to variationsresulting from legacy systems, poor implementation of unusual record types, and other circumstances.recommendation 3.1 to permit records to be ingested using largely automated processes,nara should strive to change federal agency practice and system design so that permanentelectronic records are created or provided to nara òarchiveready.óin order to achieve the requisite degree of standardization of formats and essentialmetadata, nara will need to provide very explicit guidance and realistic requirements thatrecordkeeping software systems can support. these would need to be requirements thatagencies can implement without significant changes to normal business processes or withoutinvesting in large amounts of human effort to provide needed metadata. in particular, narashould consider requiring all newly acquired agency systems that produce permanent recordsto do the following: create those records in formats acceptable to nara, include explicitmetadata in their output, and use standardized mechanisms for transferring records to nara,such as using secure network communications. in the long run, archiving considerations willhave to become part of the government process of software procurement and development forsystems that produce or are deemed likely to produce permanent records.when a government agency does indeed revise or reengineer its business practices, it can(and sometimes does) vastly improve its recordsmanagement practices. these reengineeringefforts are opportunities for nara to furnish the guidance and standards that ensure thatarchiveready records are created by the reengineered system.successful implementation of the era system may also require nara to become moreactively involved in the establishment of standards used in constructing federal systems, suchas those governing the formats used to represent records and associated metadata. it may alsorequire narañor other bodies responsible for information policy, such as the office ofmanagement and budgetñto establish guidance to agencies, together with auditing and enforcement tools as necessary.experience shows the difficulty of implementing systems that depend on usersuppliedmetadata or that depend on user compliance with externally imposed requirements that takeeffort and do not necessarily support the userõs internal business needs. consequently, narashould foster the development of software that automatically captures metadata at recordcreation. it should also work closely with agencies to determine whether its requirements canrealistically be implemented and link archiveready concerns with agency interests in supporting the agenciesõ own recordkeeping operations.finding 3.4 nara should not let the existing backlog of electronic records that are notarchiveready undermine the longterm objectives of developing capabilities and processesto handle new records through automation.over the long term, the preceding recommendations address the move to automated ingest of records. however, a considerable backlog of electronic records already exists, and itwill continue to grow before automatic measures take full effect. if nara is to avoid beingtotally swamped, it will have to perform triage on the handling of the backlog. this will meanavoiding significant manual processing, preserving the obvious context and features of thebuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations9environment that would support extraction of automatic metadata in the future, and usingautomatic metadata extraction (and accepting its shortcomings).recommendation 3.2 the era system should include fallback capabilities that do notrequire intensive manual processing for instances in which agencies do not provide recordsarchiveready. nara should accept and accommodate the resulting varying levels ofmetadata quality.there will be many cases, including those involving legacy and noncompliant systems, inwhich the specified or desired metadata are not provided along with agency records. as afallback, nara should employ lowcost if imperfect techniques for automatic metadata extraction. such techniques are a much more costeffective way than is manual processing forhandling enormous volumes of records. using these techniques will require nara to acceptsignificant imperfection in some of its metadata and thus to shift from the current mindset ofhaving very high quality metadata.it will also be necessary for era systems and processes to carefully track the provenanceof metadata and to distinguish among different metadata sources, which have varying quality.as metadataextraction techniques improve, the metadata can be upgraded; the era shouldaccommodate easily making such updates to record descriptors. improved search techniquescan also be used to improve future access.recommendation 3.3 nara should carefully consider its approach to the description, appraisal, and selection of electronic records for retention. the tradeoff between cost andutility should always be considered.as discussed above, it is essential for the era to able to ingest records automatically andto have the agencies that create records take on greater responsibility for providing requiredmetadata. however, this does not mean that agencies would have to take on the full burdentraditionally borne by archivists.the costs and benefits for varying levels of investment in metadata (using either manual orautomatic processing) should be considered carefully. electronic records present significantopportunities to exploit new capabilities, such as fullcontent searching, structured documents, and automated metadata creation. to the extent that nara can make use of fullcontent searching, and exploit search and other access mechanisms that agencies themselveshave created for their own records, there will be opportunities to create new kinds of findingaids that do not rely on manual processing.also, there are tradeoffs between what is gained through finelevel appraisal versus thecosts of making the selection of electronic records for retention. there is a growing volume ofinformation being produced, there are everimproving automated techniques for findingrecords, and a rapidly falling cost of storage. thus, instead of examining records carefully tomark only a select few for retention, it may become more expedient, and more appropriate, toretain larger òchunksó of records (even if some of the records may not warrant retention aspermanent records), in order to ensure costeffective preservation of the governmentõs output.such a shift would appear to be consistent with naraõs records management initiative, withits emphasis on functional appraisal, which implicitly is more broadly granular.recommendation 3.4 nara should continue to expand the use of cooperative arrangements that shift responsibility for preserving and providing access to records to the agencies that create them.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.10building an electronic records archive at narathe model of having certain agencies retain responsibility for certain types of records byoperating what are, in effect, affiliated archives, is well established (e.g., the arrangementscovering the preservation of large scientific data sets; a naragovernment printing officeagreement). this model could be expanded. under such arrangements, naraõs role shifts tothat of a standards setter, a recordsaccess federator, and a repository of last resort.nara would benefit from allowing more agencies to operate affiliated archives because itcould then spend its scarce resources on problems that the agencies cannot address on theirown. such arrangements would also provide a way for nara to partner with agencies toprovide better access to records. advanced access services are best provided or supported bythe mission agency that knows the domain; in this way the requisite expertise in managing acomplex system need not be transferred to nara. advanced access capabilities can also beprovided by third parties, possibly for a fee (see recommendation 4.1). with these opportunities comes the responsibility for establishing and verifying appropriate standards for affiliatedarchives and for establishing fallback mechanisms in the event that agencies cannot fulfill theirresponsibilities at some point in the future.for such partnerships to work, nara will have to offer some form of incentive. forexample, as nara develops its electronic capabilities, it has the opportunity to provide generic expertise in electronic records management and preservation that complements the subjectmatter expertise of the partner agencies. finally, as the number of partnerships grows,nara can collect, codify, and disseminate best preservation practices.in addition to depending on naraõs contributions, the success of cooperative agreementswill depend on agencies honoring their commitments under these agreements. nara mayneed to assume the role of auditor.recommendation 4. enable partnerships with otherorganizations with interests in electronic record preservationin the long run, the era should become part of a larger collection of archives, libraries,and information services operated by governments, nonprofit organizations, and the privatesector rather than a unique, standalone system that only nara runs. many other organizations are also developing large collections of electronic materials and associated systems andtoolsñnotably, initiatives launched by the library of congress, the government printingoffice, and the national library of medicine.finding 4.1 an open architecture with public interfaces would allow nara to outsourcesome functionality, encourage competition of services, and foster innovation in access.by designing the era system so that third parties can build new capabilities on top of it,nara can accomplish several things. it can, at low cost, tap the resources and entrepreneurship of other organizations, commercial firms, and researchers to provide enhanced services,help fulfill naraõs mission, increase the perceived value of naraõs holdings, and explorenew technologies and approaches.recommendation 4.1 nara should use a design strategy for the era that enables a rangeof other organizations to provide access services that nara does not offer.nara does not have to be the sole access provider. instead, it can enable agency partnersand private service providers to develop alternative access mechanisms. different providersbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations11could, for example, offer different views of the same underlying data, index them differently,or derive new digital products from them. capabilities that might be built on top of the erasystem include the following: data annotation to supplement and correct record metadatathrough thirdparty systems that are separate from nara, but accessible as if part of a unifiedsystem; the continued introduction of specialized, enhanced capabilities by partners and vendors that support particular needs; and entrepreneurship to provide valueadded services,either through application programming interfaces (apis) or bulk download.the resultñand the desired outcomeñis that nara would be able to leverage considerable assistance from its customers, partners, and other third parties. once the technical capabilities were in place, nara could take the concept one step farther by actively seeking outpartners to work in areas of interest. this effort would provide nara with a lowcost methodof exploring new technologies and staying on the leading edge.recommendation 4.2 nara should anticipate future demand for federated access torecords in the era and other affliated archives.federated access, in which a software layer allows one to access a collection of archives asif it were a single archive, would be a valuable capability. federation would provide acommon interface to federal records regardless of which agency happened to have responsibility for managing them. (recommendation 3.4, above, recommends distributing some of theburden for archiving to institutions beyond nara.) federated access would also be valuablein allowing access to span nara and presidential library resources, for example. earlyiterations of the era design may well not include these capabilities, but the era should bedesigned with their future addition in mind.although there is a large relevant technology and standards base, there is currently no realcorresponding base of operational practice in federating access to archives. among the issuesto consider are the minimum common standards that archives must agree to (e.g., uniquerecord identifiers) to support federated access. the easiest way to accommodate federationmight be to expose an api that accommodates it. and if that api is exposed, federation couldbe provided by third parties with minimal effort by nara.recommendation 5. broaden interactions with theresearch communityfinding 5.1 nara has been too narrowly engaged with the research and developmentoccurring in digital archiving, digital libraries, and related areas.in the early stages of the era program, nara sponsored several research and development projects in which it worked with limited segments of the relevant research communityconsisting of a small number of specific organizations. it has not, however, fully exploitedopportunities to engage the broader research communities working in areas related to naraõsinterests. prototypes are a useful part of the system development process and a valuable wayto test and communicate the results of research, but prototypes by themselves do not advancethe state of the art or science.recommendation 5.1 nara should be more actively engaged with multiple and diversesources of research so as to gain early experience with emerging technologies, build internal expertise, and ensure that its future needs are met.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.12building an electronic records archive at naraby virtue of its extensive experience in archiving and its significant needs for preservingelectronic materials, nara should more actively engage relevant research communitiesñforexample, by sponsoring research, suggesting problems that need to be addressed, engagingwith researchers, hosting workshops and seminars, and hiring students. these activities wouldhelp meet naraõs needs and those of the broader archival and preservation communities.an organization like nara should be involved in research for several reasons: (1) to gainearly experience with technologies that might be expected to begin appearing in commercialproducts within roughly 3 to 5 years, (2) to learn more broadly about a research area throughdirect and regular engagement with related research communities and the experts withinthose communities, (3) to describe to researchers challenging problems faced by nara, and(4) to build absorptive capacity to understand how to apply the results of relevant researchsponsored by other organizations.nara should anticipate that since research involves a degree of risk, not all researchprojects will necessarily produce results that can be implemented directly. the tradeoff is thatnara stands to benefit from innovative ideas that had not been anticipated.to manage its research activities most effectively, nara should seek to employ individuals who have existing relationships with the various relevant research communities. suchindividuals should also bring with them a proven track record of producing or applyingresearch results in these areas.finding 5.2 most of the technical challenges faced by nara are shared with other organizations operating large repositories for digital materials, but a few problems are specific tothe operation of nara and similar archives.two distinct classes of research areas in which nara appears to have unmet technologyneeds are apparent:1. problems shared with other organizations. most of naraõs technical problems are the sameas those faced by designers and operators of any large digital library or repository. for thesetypes of problems, naraõs greatest leverage will come from drawing on research sponsoredby other organizations, learning about best practices, inducing others to work on problems ofinterest to nara by offering corpora, and participating in joint research programs with otherfederal agencies and organizations that face similar challenges. wherever technologies may beshared with other applications, partnerships to jointly address problems involving these technologies will help stretch limited research resources. by joining with others, nara also cancouple to a joint learning curveñthat is, it wonõt have to make unique mistakes.2. problems specific to government archives and similar institutions. examples of research problems of particular importance to nara and similar institutions include the following: howgovernment transactions systems should be preserved, how to provide digital assurances overa very long period of time, and how to provide semiautomated redaction and declassificationof materials. working on these more specialized problems may require engagement withspecific existing research communities. partnership with agencies that have greater experiencein managing it research programs is also likely to be the most effective mechanism for thisclass of research problems.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations13recommendation 5.2 nara should develop a research strategy that lays out its technicalneeds and the partnerships that would best address them.considering naraõs limited resources, its limited capacity to manage research programs,and a set of challenging technical problems related to the general topic of archiving and digitalpreservation, the issues of how and where nara should invest arise. questions for nara toconsider include these: what agencies share an interest in naraõs problem or a similarproblem? what research community is working on that problem or a similar problem? howcan nara most effectively join and influence that community? how can it learn from orparticipate in othersõ research programs? what results are anticipated, and how will the results be brought back to nara?the development and deployment of the era will engender a number of research topics.some of these topics can perhaps be anticipated now, but others will arise only as experiencewith the era accrues. having a research agenda will help guide nara in selecting whichresearch initiatives and organizations to become involved with. as nara defines its researchagenda, it should be careful to frame its needs as problems that academic and commercialresearchers can understand and address, and it should frame them in ways that are amenableto working in partnership with other organizations.developing a research agenda is likely to be daunting when an organization is in the midstof a rapid technological and cultural shift, as is nara today. fortunately, nara need not(and should not) work in isolation or start from scratch in developing a research agenda.partnering with more experienced research organizations, as recommended below (see recommendation 5.3), will help, but nara will nonetheless need to develop its own voice.several recent research agendas in the area of archiving and preservation (including reportsprepared for the national science foundation [nsf], the library of congress, and naraõsnational historical publications and records commission) provide a basis for nara to findcommon ground with other research initiatives.recommendation 5.3 nara should implement its research strategy by working with otheragencies that have similar research needs and expertise in managing research programs.implementation of naraõs research strategy will require parsing the agenda into a research program, building or joining a community of researchers, monitoring work, and creating incentives and opportunities for technology transfer. in carrying out all of these activities,nara should seek partnerships with agencies for which research management is a corecompetency, such as nsf or the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa). theseagencies have developed considerable expertise with selecting and reviewing research, engaging with research communities, and managing research projects. the selection of specificresearch proposals and routine management of the research process should be left to organizations for which research management is a core competence. nara should work with itspartners to ensure that it has a voice in developing research initiatives and has opportunitiesto engage directly with the organizations and experts that do the research.naraõs fundamental requirements for digital preservation and access are shared to varying degrees with a number of government organizations that also must maintain access todigital records into the indefinite future. problems such as semiautomatic redaction or declassification can be investigated with partners such as darpa or the intelligence communityõsadvanced research and development activity (arda). another opportunity is presented bybuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.14building an electronic records archive at naransfõs program in digital preservation, which is explicitly designed to support multiagencyparticipation.recommendation 5.4 nara should also engage the research community by providingaccess to data in the form of electronic records.academic researchers are often starved for data: they have good ideas, but no way to testthem in the real world. providing interesting data in a form that the research community canuse is often a sufficient incentive to get the best people working on a problem. it also providesa very costeffective way of engaging a research community. the national institute of standards and technology and a number of university groups have experience in this area;partnering with such an organization would help nara learn how to create data sets that areinteresting and useful to various research communities.nara might also consider providing direct access to some of its digital archives in theform of apis that provide access to selected internal data or operations of the era system,enabling people to build new interfaces or applications on top of naraõs archives. suchaccess would be attractive to a variety of computer science and social science research communities, and it could be provided by nara at relatively low cost, considering the potentialbenefits.recommendation 6. enhance capabilities and provide governmentwide leadership for record integrity and provenanceas nara recognizes, electronic records are subject to a variety of threats, ranging fromaccidental corruption to deliberate tampering, that are quite different in character from thethreats to which paper records are subject. it is essential for the era and the recordsmanagement practices that it supports or requires to be up to the task of adequately protecting thepublic record.fortunately, electronic records also afford important opportunities to improve integrityand authenticity assurance through the use of robust cryptographic techniques, automaticreplication, and system design. in order to ensure trust in the digital records held by the era,stringent measuresñincluding the use of cryptographic techniquesñshould be taken to protect records against deliberate or accidental compromise. these methods should be built intothe era system design and its operational procedures. the overall trustworthiness of recordsalso depends on the methods used by agencies that supply records to the era. thus, narashould concern itself with the trustworthiness of a record throughout its entire custody chain,and it should provide leadership on these issues.finding 6.1 naraõs past procedures and practices would be inadequate for safeguardingdigital records.concepts developed and applied to paper records, such as chain of custody, are also ofvalue in assessing the authenticity of electronic records. they do not, however, adequatelyaddress the threats associated with electronic records. these threats include hardware, software, and operational errors, as well as individuals (both outsiders and insiders) who mayeither tamper in subtle ways with individual records or systematically modify large numbersof records.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations15recommendation 6.1 the era should use appropriate technical and procedural methodsavailable for assuring the integrity and authenticity of electronic records.the new vulnerabilities introduced by virtue of the digital nature of the records to bepreserved underscore the importance of complementing traditional procedures by makinguse of robust digital techniques and an appropriate overall system design for verifying integrity and authenticity.digital assurances for records are based fundamentally on maintaining multiple, geographically and administratively separated copies and on two cryptographic toolsñhash digests for integrity checking and digital signatures for authentication. digital signatures are an excellent technique for verifying that recently transmitted datañsuch as a set of records being transferredfrom an agency to narañactually came from where they were supposed to have come, butdigital signatures are a poor means of verifying the origin of stored data. instead, the origincan be verified (1) at ingest, by recording metadata on the outcome of having verified theorigin of those data at the time they were received, and (2) from then on, by maintaining theintegrity of the stored data and associated metadata. designing digital assurances into an electronic records archive is similar to designingsecurity measures: that is, the cryptographic techniques must be chosen carefully, but moreimportantly, the overall system design, not just the cryptographic mechanisms, must notallow openings for attackers. and as with security systems, provisions must be made tochange the cryptographic algorithms or system design if the chosen cryptographic algorithmsare ever found to be faulty (a very likely contingency at some time in the future) or if thesystem design is found to be susceptible to attack.cryptographic protections are only a part of the solution, however, in part because theydetect damage or attack only after the fact. prevention and repair are even more crucial partsof the solution and depend on careful procedures and system designs, including the following: (1) maintaining multiple copies that are geographically separated and independentlyadministered; (2) tracking records from their origins, through storage and it systems of various sorts, and eventually into the archive; (3) protecting the systems that hold records fromunauthorized tampering, both by internal employees and external attackers; (4) employingaccess controls, audit logs, and procedural safeguards when changing the archive contents toreduce human errors (e.g., requiring multiple people to authorize a change); and (5) employing sound software development methodologies to reduce the likelihood of record corruptiondue to software bugs.recommendation 6.2 throughout the era system design and operation, nara shouldcarry out an iterative threat modeling, analysis, and response process.a threat analysis should be done early in the design of the era so that proper securitymeasures can be designed and implemented from the outset. it is essential that era designproposals be analyzed against a threat model in order to gain an understanding of the degreeto which alternative designs are vulnerable to attack. the threat analysis should be undertaken not only for the era itself, but also for the entire chain of custody of a record from itscreation, through its retention for active use in a government agency, to its eventual transfer tothe archive. this initial threat modeling would be only the first step of a larger, iterative threatcountering process that involved designing against expected threats, observing failures thatoccur, and designing new countermeasures. threat modeling and analysis are a specializedbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.16building an electronic records archive at naraart, which suggests that nara should seek outside specialists to undertake these tasks undercontract.recommendation 6.3 the era should be designed so that auditing, monitoring, and testing of ongoing operations verify that digital assurance measures are working as intended.methods for detecting very rare events such as the corruption of stored information areextremely susceptible to error because they are rarely exercised. the era should be designedto include ongoing processes that detect errors and that exercise errordetection and correctionprocedures. one of the threats to era integrity is software errors that corrupt file structures.for this reason, procedures associated with introducing new software must provide for adequate testing, gradual introduction of software changes so that impacts on data integrity areapparent early on, and capabilities to repair any errors that are introduced.recommendation 6.4 nara should ensure that it has access to expertise in digital assurance techniques and in the operational procedures that accompany them.the basic cryptographic techniques and other trustworthiness measures discussed in thisrecommendation are widely used in a variety of contexts. however, their application in asystem designed to provide very long term assurances of authenticity, integrity, and chainofcustody management is likely to be leading edge for the foreseeable future. as a result, narawill need access to highly specialized expertise on an ongoing basisñfor example, to assessinitial and subsequent system designs and operational procedures. as it would seem difficultfor nara to maintain this kind of highly specialized expertise inhouse, it should considerestablishing an expert advisory committee to specifically address the kinds of issues discussedin this recommendation. digital assurance in the context of longterm preservation is also apossible research area for nara.recommendation 6.5 nara should lead an effort to enhance digital assurance for electronic records governmentwide.agencies also need to protect records, lest naraõs archiving activities turn into a ògarbagein, garbageoutó exercise. all of the subfindings and subrecommendations presentedabove are equally applicable to the agencies that originate records and later pass them tonara and to agencies that manage records locally under cooperative agreements.naraõs role in records management offers an opportunity to establish federal standardsand to inaugurate, advance, and even mandate their use in records management. by virtue ofits central role and planned longevity, the era is the ultimate client, and perhaps the one withthe most stringent requirements, for secure digital records management. nara has undertaken leadership in other areas of records management through the records management redesign program and the egovernment electronic records management initiative and has issuedrecordsmanagement guidance in several areas related to digital assurance. nara should helpspread the use of digital assurance techniques, as well as monitor their use in records management, throughout the government.concluding remarksas the national archives and records administration recognizes, its initiatives for electronic records are critical to fulfilling its mission to preserve essential evidence as society andbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.summary and recommendations17government information continues to move to a borndigital and even onlydigital state. infulfilling its mission, nara enters an era in which it must understand, cope with, and embrace the rapid pace of change that characterizes information technology. as these changesunfold, nara will face a number of difficult questions, some of them alluded to above.the rapid evolution in government information and information systems provides a goodillustration. formal government communications continue to be conventional records: forms,letters, pictures, and so on. but citizens and government officials increasingly interact via email and text and voice messages, not memoranda and forms. web pages increasingly presentnot only static documents but also ephemeral views that are not stored as records, but aremerely computed from online databases through software that itself changes over time. whatportions of this constantly changing material are essential evidence that documents the national experience? handling the resulting flood of data and recreating the behavior of evermorecomplex it systems decades later are both extremely difficult challenges. the nationalrecords and archives administration of an egovernment will have to be equipped to addressthe technical challenges that arise, and to examine and possibly revise how it carries out itsbasic mission.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all

increase in the volume of digital records: moreinformation is being produced and stored, a greater fraction of information is born digital, anda greater fraction of the borndigital material is retained only in digital form.a study conducted at the university of california, berkeley, estimated at about 30 percenta year the rate of growth in the total amount of new information stored between 1999 and2002.1 much of this information is being produced and stored in digital form. although it isdifficult to isolate the amount of federal government information in these general data, there isno reason to assume that the federal government is not experiencing these broader trends.a growing percentage of information is born digital, stored in file servers, database systems, correspondencemanagement systems, and other electronic information systems, andnot systematically retained on paper. the university of california, berkeley, study found thatthe amount of information printed on paper is still increasing but that printed documentsrepresent less than 1 percent of the total information being produced today and that the vastmajority of information is being stored on magnetic media. this result seems reasonable,given anecdotal evidence that the vast majority of documents, for example, are created usingoffice automation software. no paper copy may ever be produced of many of the variousborndigital records that are stored in file servers, database systems, correspondencemanagement systems, and other electronic information systems. as electronic filing systems becomemore commonplace, it will become less likely than in the past for the paper copies that areprinted to be retained systematically.1peter lyman and hal r. varian. 2003. how much information, 2003.

records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.ongoing technology change and rising user expectations19this trend away from paper documents is illustrated by the experience of the governmentprinting office, which reports that the number of documents that it prints has fallen by roughlytwothirds over the past decade. people are increasingly accessing documents via the web,and many publications are no longer produced in paper form at all.five major technology trends support a prediction that the national archives and recordsadministration (nara) will soon face an avalanche of digital materials:¥computer technology makes it easier and less expensive to record more information than can berecorded in the paper world. the increasing use of automated systems will make it possible tocapture a larger number of records associated with government functions. automated egovernment services and systems, for example, will enable and encourage more transactionsper citizen and per government employee.¥information and transactions are finergrained. information is becoming òfinergrained.ófor example, it will be possible to recordñand preserveñall of the individual changes madeto a case file as well as its final contents. content/documentmanagement systems allow anaudit trail for every individual who òtouchesó (i.e., creates, displays, copies, or modifies) arecord. this audit trail metadata could be quite voluminous. also, new kinds of records will becreated as data from governmentoperated sensors are automatically logged.many recordkeeping systems are transactionbased, with databases whose contents arecontinually changing. in many cases, it may be impractical to log and preserve all of thesetransactions. the alternative is that systems are designed so that snapshots are captured andpreserved on a regular basis. this way of preserving data will require changes in systemdesign and careful consideration about what should be captured, what format it should becaptured in, what the refresh rate should be, and so forth.¥information is often dynamically generated. information used by the public and by decisionmakers is increasingly created onthefly. for example, many web pages today are dynamically created and formatted for presentation from underlying databases. the problem ofarchiving databases that change over time is not a new one, but archivists will face morecomplex preservation decisions as more and more information is dynamically generated.even when the underlying database itself is amenable to preservation, displaying informationfrom that database for users poses enormous challenges. for example, the information displayed might be the output of analysis software that has gone through multiple revisionsñwhat was actually viewed on any particular day is a function of the version of the softwarerunning on that day. capturing such changes and transformations is both challenging andcrucial.¥technologies will allow people to communicate and record information in new ways. in the1990s, some email messages began to be determined to be permanent records. likewise,technologies today are creating records that may be selected in the future for permanentpreservation; examples include video conferencing, instant messaging, voice over internetprotocol, and video presentations.¥the drop in storage costs drives the retention of information that previously would have beendiscarded. the cost per unit of storage currently falls by roughly a factor of two per year.2 as a2for a detailed examination of trends in disk drive storage, see, for example, h. grochowski and r.d. halem,2003, òtechnological impact of magnetic hard disk drives on storage systems,ó ibm systems journal 42(2).building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.20building an electronic records archive at nararesult, enormous quantities of information are being stored today. the university of california, berkeley, study estimates, for example, that just over 400,000 terabytes of original information are stored each year on hard disks.3 indeed, storage costs have dropped so much in thepast decade that many individuals and organizations have stopped ògarbage collectingó (i.e.,deleting old files) within their stored information. as this trend continues, businesses willincreasingly destroy electronic records on the basis of the business risks of retaining recordsbeyond regulatory mandates rather than because of storage costs. with digital storage growing ever cheaper, it becomes more economical to keep everything than it is to put in the effortneeded to decide what can be thrown away. tools capable of searching everlarger volumes ofinformation will help fuel demand for more things to be considered permanent records.the volume of data to be stored will also grow because individual records will continue tobecome larger. it is becoming easier and more commonplace to generate and digitally storemultimedia and other rich content. a 30minute video file is much larger than a 30minuteaudio file. a powerpoint presentation with embedded animation is much larger than aplaintext file.finally, the total number and variety of record data types that must be stored by thenational archives and records administration and other repositories will increase over timeas new versions of existing data types and entirely new data types are invented.4the overall growth in the variety of data types will be accompanied by spurts of growthand contraction in the number of data types in active use at any point in time: as a new class ofrecord types emerges, one will likely see an initial explosion of data types. that proliferationwill occur as various vendors introduce products, and it will be followed by a consolidation toa smaller number of de facto standards as the market picks winners and losers. over time,barriers to market entry will tend to increase as an industry segment matures; those barrierswill lead to a smaller number of vendors and higher expectations of greater interchangeability.there were, for example, many early word processors, each with its own file format, but today3peter lyman and hal r. varian. 2003. how much information, 2003. school of information management andsystems, university of california, berkeley. available online at

imagesñare expressed as a collection of bits. for example, an image might be representedby bits whose data type is tiff, gif, or jpeg, where the specification describes how the bits are to be interpretedas an image. the more commonplace term òfile formató is often used interchangeably with data type, but datatype is more appropriate. the literal interpretation of file format is a specification for a file made up of bits. insome cases the bits might be embedded within a file (e.g., a file might contain a folder that contains multiple emailmessages, one of which contains an image of data type gif). some data types are wrappers that encapsulate otherdata types. for example, files of data type wave may contain linear pulse code modulated or highly compressedaudio. other data types support bundling of multiple collections of bits that represent a single record togetherwith associated metadata. compounding the complexity of the problem are the myriad options and subtypesassociated with some data types. for example, tiff, which is a wellestablished data type for images, specifies awrapper that can contain several different image encodings. newer image data types such as jpeg2000 are evenmore complex. the library of congress web site (òdigital formats for library of congress collections,ó <http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/>, accessed may 1, 2005), from which this discussion was partially drawn,provides information about various data types.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.ongoing technology change and rising user expectations21only a small number of data types are commonly used. similarly, early web sites depended onnumerous ad hoc scripts, but todayõs web sites are commonly implemented using more standard approaches. today, the broad range of extensible markup language (xml)related formats is relatively immature and can be expected to follow a similar pattern.despite expected changes over time, for the foreseeable future there will be many datatypes and subtypes in use, creating great difficulty for archiving. nara will never be able tosupport all of these types and subtypes equally well, yet important records may be created inthese formats. compromises in terms of the level of service provided will be necessary (see thesection òlongterm preservation,ó below).nara will need to monitor the kinds of trends described above for several reasons. thevolume and types of electronic records that it must handle have implications for the resourcesdevoted to them. nara must be able to anticipate trends in order to be able to make necessarychanges to its own systems, to issue requests for proposals (rfps) with sufficient scalabilityrequirements, and to advise and influence agencies as they implement new systems. theobjective is to avoid surprises like the one that occurred in the 1990s when use of emailbecame widespread and it proved difficult to adapt to this novel form of records.it is neither essential nor costeffective to carry out detailed surveys of potential types andvolumes of records. internally, nara will need staff with the expertise and responsibility totrack changes. external advice, such as that obtained through research activities or advisorycommittees, can supplement naraõs capacity to predict changes and discontinuities in recordtypes and volume. such external advice would be based on an awareness of new data types onthe horizon and on an understanding of information production inside government and morebroadly in society.planning for continued technology changeit is envisioned that naraõs electronic records archives (era) will operate for manydecades. the enormous changes in information technology (it) that have occurred just in thepast 10 years suggest that the era will experience considerable technology change during itsexistence. these changes will come about in terms of both the types of records that the erawill need to accommodate and the technology components that will be available for use infuture iterations of the era. indeed, the technology context and the system itself are likely toevolve during the eraõs lifetimeñso much so that the problem can be usefully viewed largelyin terms of how the era system will evolve around the archiveõs data and the data structuresused to represent them, both of which are comparatively stable.an important component of planning for the eraõs evolution will be to identify anddistinguish various trendsñthose requiring system change, those requiring system additions,and those requiring simply that the system be sufficiently scalable.technology performance improvementsalthough the committee does not have a crystal ball for seeing far into the technologyfuture, past experience suggests some relevant technology trends that are likely to persist.precise changes in the eraõs component technologies, for example, cannot be predicted, butsome general trends are apparent. storage will continue to become much denser and cheaper.as in the past, new forms of storage providing such desired characteristics as higher volumetbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.22building an electronic records archive at nararic density, lower cost, and faster access times will continue to emerge, and the commercialmarket will move toward these new technologies. as was discussed in the committeeõs firstreport, at present, tapebased storage is gradually being replaced by magnetic disk storage.also, the familiar trend of processors and networks becoming ever faster will continue, making possible costeffective network transfer and processing of everlarger volumes of records.the past 20 years have seen dramatic performance improvements in many directions. in1984, for example, a stateoftheart workstation had a processor that operated at 1 millioninstructions per second and had 1 megabyte of ram. in 2004, a competent offtheshelf personal computer (pc), which cost much less than the 1984 workstation, had a processor with aclock rate of around 2 gigahertz and 1 gigabyte of ram. in 1984 a 10 megabyte hard drive fora pc retailed for $2,500; today a 250 gigabyte hard drive for a pc retails for under $200. thecapacity is up by a factor of 25,000, and the cost per byte is down by a factor of 300,000. in 1984,the fastest links in the internet were 64 kilobits per second; today the fastest links are 40gigabits per secondñup by a factor of nearly a million.experience has shown that it typically takes a decade or more to figure out what can bedone with such new capabilities. for example, all of the internet technology necessary tosupport the world wide web existed by 1982. that included a working internet, a goodsizedcommunity of users with a need to communicate organized information of various types, theconcept of hypertext, the domain name system, and desktop pcs connected to the network.but the world wide web itself wasnõt invented until 1991ñit took a full 9 years to work outthe implications and realize that this application was possible. therefore, even if technologyimprovements were to stop in their tracks tomorrow, one would still expect a very high rate ofchange (improvement in performance and cost) in delivered systems for at least another twodecades. and there is no reason to suppose that these sorts of sustained performance improvements will not continue into the indefinite future.exploiting the commercial mainstreamthe era system will benefit from continuing technology evolution only if the era implementation stays roughly in step with mainstream commercial trends. the functions of the eraare not uncommon enough to support the use of unique hardware or software components,and relying on such components would expose nara to the risk of significantly greater costsand more difficult system evolution. there will be, to be sure, some solutions that lead the wayand appear to have a good chance of being adopted by a larger community later on. however,nara should be wary of specialpurpose solutions that do not enjoy the benefits of continuous technology improvements.sustained improvements in the costperformance ratio are reflected almost entirely inhighvolume products. examples of highvolume products today are personal computers;ata/ide5 disk drives; compactdisk readonly memory (cdrom), cdrecordable (cdr),digital versatile disk (dvd)rom and dvdr optical storage devices; and ethernet (10 mega5the conventional industry shorthand for a family of widely used harddrive interface standards known asadvanced technology attachment (ata), integrated drive electronics (ide), enhanced ide (eide), and ultradirect memory access (udma).building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.ongoing technology change and rising user expectations23bit [mb], 100 mb, and 1 gigabit [gb]) networks. each of these products has seen sustaineddecreases in cost per unit of performance. in contrast, lowvolume products rarely exhibitsustainable costperformance improvement and often disappear rapidly from use. todayõstrend in moving to disk from tape for mass storage is an example of what often happens insuch cases, with a very high volume product replacing a relatively low volume product.despite the anticipated rapid changes in many component technologies, past experiencesuggests that network interoperability will be relatively stable. important examples includethe backward compatibility among several generations of ethernet and the persistence of theinternetõs transmission control protocol/internet protocol (tcp/ip) standards. as networking hardware and software evolve, they are likely to offer backward compatibility of networkprotocols and interfaces. thus it will be possible to connect new equipment to old equipmentvia network hardware of various kinds, and it will be relatively easy to add new capacity to anarchival system and to federate archival systems.flexible, modular, and extensible designeffective upgrading of hardware and software to stay on the technology curve of mainstream it also places a premium on flexibility. at a minimum, the software for the era systemshould be written to be as portable as possible across offerings of different computer andstorage vendors. nara should also seek out products that can be obtained from multiplevendors, so as to avoid being locked in to an arrangement with a single vendor.another key to the successful functioning of the era over time will be careful modulardesign, which is critical to allowing components to evolve or to be replaced as needed. itsimply takes too long to redesign a monolithic system to exploit technology improvements.modular design makes a complex problem more tractable by breaking it down into a set ofsmaller components and enabling the independent evolution of the parts. this type of systemis decomposed into separate modules, each with a welldefined interface. properly designedcomponents can then be replaced with improved versions, while causing minimal disruptionto other modules or to the system as a whole. if modules are too large, they become hard tomodify or replace. if the interfaces are overly complex or if they permit internal details of amoduleõs implementation to become visible to other modules, the ability to change one module independently of others may be lost.in addition to being designed for change, the era should be designed to be extensibleñthat is, to be able to adapt to some kinds of changes without requiring modification of thesystem, at least not immediately. for example, if nara began accepting a new format, thesystem should at first accept it as a type òunknown.ó that way, new records could be acceptedwithout having to wait for the system to be modified. later, a small, typespecific modulecould be added to facilitate more sophisticated handling of the type.longterm preservationthe committeeõs first report, citing the imperative of making significant progress towardimplementing an archival system, proposed a pragmatic shortterm strategy that included thefollowing: (1) preserving the original bit stream representing a record; (2) converting recordsto òpreferred variantó formats, where available, that are likely to be more readily interpretablein the future; and (3) preserving enough information for records amenable to emulation apbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.24building an electronic records archive at naraproaches so as not to foreclose that option. however, as development of the era proceeds,nara will have to seek out longerterm preservation solutions.as the committeeõs first report discussed, a fundamental requirement of the era is theability to store and retrieve the bit streams representing a record and its associated metadata.the requirements for this part of the era are fairly well understood (although good implementations will be quite complex, and they will certainly require refinement and evolutionover time). in addition, technologies exist or are being developed to satisfy many of theserequirements, and research projects are already reaching advanced states.as a general rule, one keeps the original bits,6 since this allows for using the originalviewer if that is still possible, and it ensures that all information that was in a record is stillthere (even if interpreting it may be problematic). also, the bit stream resulting from a reversible transformation applied to the original bits is as good as the original bit stream, providedthat the transformation is errorfree. the transformation of an uncompressed bitmap imageinto a runlength encoding produces a file equivalent to the original bit stream, assuming, ofcourse, that the technical metadata identify or define the new representation correctly.the lowest level of a system architecture for a digital archive is a storage component thatsees the bit streams as objects. this component supports a simple object interface used tocreate, delete (in cases where a specific retention period applies), and retrieve an object. manyof the design issues associated with object storage were addressed in the committeeõs firstreport. in practice, good implementations will be quite complex and they will certainly evolve.therefore, one of the main characteristics of such a subsystem should be its modularity,enabling components to be upgraded without affecting other parts. there is also a growingcommercial interest in subsystems with such object stores. this interest is driven by suchdevelopments as new regulations that mandate longterm retention.however, ensuring that bits can be understood in the distant future is a much more difficultproblem than are issues involving object storage. various approaches have been developed,7none of which is suitable in all cases. moreover, one cannot know with any great certainty whichproposed methods for preserving the interpretability of digital objects into the distant future willsubsequently be deemed successful, much less prove relatively costeffective.preservation of records will thus require selecting the appropriate preservation techniquesfor particular types of records. an archive can and should, of course, use different approachesfor different types of record, and it can and may simultaneously and in parallel pursue severalapproaches for a particular type of record. electronic records archivists will need to understand the range of available preservation techniques and make judgments about which areappropriate.because each approach has potential drawbacks and associated costs, compromises will beneeded, based on levels of service. a compromise may involve preserving a subset of the6the òbit streamó or òdata streamó to be preserved does not include mediaspecific encoding techniques,checksums, and so forth, that take place at the physical storage layer. the marketplace can generally be relied on toshake out any such òunder the coversó concernsñfor example, no one today worries about whether (or how) advdrom reversibly encodes the bits.7there is an extensive literature on the longterm interpretation problem. a compilation of some recent work canbe found in gerard clifton and michael day, 2004, òfile formats and tools,ó in dpc/padi whatõs

reserved.ongoing technology change and rising user expectations25functionalities associated with a particular record. for example, the archivist may stipulatethat the printed representation of a document is all that matters. in that case, saving the pictureof the page may be sufficient (assuming that there is enough metadata to support efficientaccess). for another type of document, the archivist may require a higher level of service byasking that the comments hidden in the file also be archived. then, in order to be equivalent tothe original, the new representation will have to contain the comments. a still higher level ofservice may require that the interactive environment of the word processor itself be reproducible in the future. box 1.1 provides some additional examples of levels of service.for each document type (or document type in a particular collection), the archivist needsto determine the appropriate levels of service that should be used. in the example above,preserving the look of the page and the comments is sufficient if the look and commentsconstitute the essential information of the document. this means that any additional information (for example, which buttons were used to produce it!) is deemed nonessential, or incidental. any incidental information may be discarded in the preservation process without any lossof value. deciding what is essential is crucial to good archiving. a report from the nationalarchives of australia says it well: òdetermining the essence of records . . . is essential to anefficient, effective and accountable preservation program. focusing on the essence of a recordallows us to clearly state our archival requirements for the preservation of that record and tobe held accountable against those requirements.ó8the archivist has three basic approaches among which to select:1.keep the information in its original format and rely on running the original viewer on anemulation of the original system, or running a viewer (or at least a program that decodes theoriginal data) on a stable virtual machine.2.keep the information in a standard or intermediate format (i.e., converted once at most)and commit to providing a viewer for that format into the far future.3.convert the format into a new one when obsolescence is threatening the readability ofthe record.each option is discussed in more detail below.one general approach to preservation:keep the information in its original formatas described below, several approaches to preservation rely on keeping the informationfrom a record in its original format.relying on the availability of the original viewerin the long term the original viewer will no longer work, but it is important to realize thatthe viewer may still exist in the mediumterm. when the original representation is kept, thatviewer can be used, and the threat of obsolescence is delayed, possibly by several years. the8helen heslop, simon davis, and andrew wilson.

(very precisely) the program to be usedand all of the parameters that will ensure a faithful interpretation. the preservation subsystemmay also contain information on various paths for accessing the right application program.for example, the same application program may run on windows 2000 or windows xp.similarly, the same operating system may run on different hardware environments. therefore,when a component becomes obsolete along one access path, another path may still be availbox 1.1examples of varying levels of service for records preservation¥preserving textñwithout presentation. assuming that a file is an ascii text file (original orobtained by converting the document once), metadata can be used to specify how to interpretthe bits. the metadata must include the definition of every character, either in english or byshowing the bitmap of each character in a common font (the bitmap format itself must be explained). but still, the amount of metadata remains very reasonable.¥images. it may be reasonable to assume that a few formats for images may be used asstandards (the commonly used options within the tagged image file format (tiff) standard arean example) and that such formats will be explained in detail in so many places that decodingalgorithms will always exist. however, some special formats will always exist as well, and oncemany formats exist, some will become obsolete more quickly. in such cases, it is preferable tomake sure that the format interpretation is specified in the metadata; if the interpretation is toocomplicated, it may be better to convert the original bit stream into another one that may be lesscompressed but easier to explain. an alternative is to store a program executable on a virtualmachine; this keeps the original format and only converts it to a simple bitmap image (a logicalview) for presentation on demand. note that the logical view can be the same whatever theoriginal format is, greatly simplifying the job of the future user.¥data structures in xmlñno presentation. given the widespread and growing use of xml(extensible markup language), an increasing amount of information will be organized and exchanged as xml structures. nonetheless, metadata describing the semantic meanings of thetags must be captured.¥relational databases. multiple levels of service can be identified. the most basic level onlypreserves the data. it comprises the content of the table in a character form and the schemacontaining the table and column names, comments on their semantics, units, integrity constraints, and so on. instructions on how to decode the format in which the elements are storedmust also be archived (as a precise explanation or as a program written for a virtual machine).a higher level of service will request that one preserve the querying and reporting capabilitiesof the initial system. if these capabilities were simply those of standard sql (structured querylanguage), nothing other than the data would be needed, since a query component could bewritten in the future. but modern database systems employ userdefined functions. to be able inthe future to ask the same questions as those asked today, the definition of these functions mustalso be preserved. if there is enough incentive to code these functions for a stable virtual machine, a future system would be able to make use of them. however, as soon as the complexityincreases, a full reenactment of the sql system may be needed, which in turn requires anbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.ongoing technology change and rising user expectations27able. a particular use of such metadata may be to trigger an alarm condition when the lastpath is in danger of being broken by obsolescence.9emulation of the original machine. more generally, an application is often used to present thedata (presentation is more than just a literal display of the data in the relational databasemanagement system [rdbms]), accept transactions, and so forth, and thus it embodies considerable information about the meaning of the data. the raw data (or data schema) alone does notspecify the meaning; either very careful additional documentation must be preserved or theremust be some way to execute or emulate the application at least in part (e.g., for presentation).another approach is to consider the database as a vehicle in which records are stored so asto provide efficient access and other capabilities. instead of archiving the vehicle itself, therecords can be rebuilt from the database and archived as data structures.¥general data structure. not all records are relational or xml. many files may have theirown format to represent geographical data, engineering data, or statistical data. not all files canbe converted to xml because, in some cases, the volume of the information in them wouldincrease dramatically. thus, there is a need to specify how to decode these formats as well.¥documents with presentation. when it is important to preserve the look of a printed document, it is always possible to store an image of the individual pages. in any case, the original bitstream can be archived, together with information on how to decode it. but these formats can beso complicated that only a program can do the job. the program can be written for a virtualmachine; it would essentially generate on demand a structure that contains both the tagged dataelements of the document and their explicit presentation attributes, down to the individual charactersõ images. reconstructing a page is then easy; there is no need for any original wordprocessor or viewer. an alternative is to do the conversion once at ingest time and to archive theresulting structure.¥spreadsheet. a spreadsheet is a document with presentation, so the item above applies. afirst level of service may be to save the content as an image. but some of the values appearingin cells are specified as formulas that compute them as a function of the values in other cells. inthe next level of service, these formulas could be stored as metadata to convey the mathematical relationships between cells. if the archivist decides that a future user should be able toexecute these formulas, then the execution of a program becomes necessary. a virtual machineapproach or emulation can be used.¥dynamic applications. extreme cases such as video games or highly interactive applications may require the archiving of programs to reenact the original behavior. if the code exists ina highlevel language, compiling it for a stable virtual machine is possible. but more often thebest alternative is to emulate the original hardware and software on which the program ran.since the emulator may have to be timesensitive, the implementation would be much moreinvolved.9this functionality has been implemented in a development system. see r.j. van diessen, 2002, preservationrequirements in a deposit system, koninklijke bibliotheek, the hague, the netherlands. available online at

longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.28building an electronic records archive at nararelying on metadatain some simple cases, it is possible to include a specification of the process itself withoutintroducing a program.10 for example, the definition of the bmp bitmap image data type canbe explained in a few sentences. unfortunately, however, processes are generally too complicated to be completely defined by a textual explanation.relying on standardsif it were possible to rely only on a small set of wellestablished standards, it might bereasonable to imagine that the viewer could be rewritten every time the platform changed.using standards is certainly good practice. however, the variety of formats that exists today isdue in part to the fact that different formats have different performance or easeofuse characteristics. users and communities may not be satisfied with tools that they do not think areoptimal for their applications and their environments.emulating the original systemthe approach of emulating the original system consists of keeping the original executableprogram that was used to create and/or manipulate the information in the first place. thatprogram (with its operating system) works only on the original or an equivalent machine. inthe future, the only way to execute the program would be to rely on an emulator.initial proposals for emulation suggested that a description of the original machine architecture be archived in all its details so that an emulator might be written when needed. thissuggestion is hard to carry out when the expertise on the original machine has evaporated orwhen the original machine is not available for testing. an alternative to this approach is towrite some kind of emulator specification early, when the expertise exists, and to use thatinformation to generate an emulator when the new machine on which it would run is known.a second alternative is to rely on a stable virtual machine,11 allowing an emulator of theoriginal machine to be writtenñand debuggedñat the time the original machine is known. inthe future, a virtual machine emulator will make it possible to execute the emulator of theoriginal machine, providing an original machine that then executes the original applicationcode. the metadata must simply contain a userõs guide on how to run the program.preserving the execution of the original program is justifiable when reenacting thatprogramõs behavior is of interest, but it is overkill for data archiving. in order to archive acollection of pictures when only the pictures themselves are of interest for posterity, it shouldnot be necessary to save the full system that enabled the original user to create, modify, andenhance the pictures. to read an email, it is not necessary to reactivate the whole emailsystem! there is another drawback: in many cases the application program may display thedata in a certain way (for example, a graphical representation) without giving explicit access to10j. rothenberg. 1999. avoiding technological quicksand: finding a viable technical foundation for digital preservation, council on library

basic data from the old systemto the new one, making the reuse of the data all but impossible.relying on a stable virtual machinethe method of preservation that relies on a stable virtual machine consists of archivingwith the original file, a decoding program p, which understands the internal structure andpresents the information in a logical view (a hierarchical structure of tagged elements similarto those used in xml). that program p is written for the virtual machine. in the future, arestoreapplication program reads the bit stream and the program p; it passes p to an emulatorof the virtual machine that executes it. during that execution the data are decoded and returned to the client according to the logical view. the schema of the view (the definition of thetags) can also be archived and retrieved by using a similar technique.note that in addition to decoding the data structure, the program p may perform anyarbitrary code on the data. for example, some data elements returned in the logical view canbe obtained by computation on other data elements. if the virtual machine provides a minimalcommunication mechanism, the program p can receive parameters from the future environment and compute a new object content dynamically.12a second general approach to preservation: convert once to astandard or canonical formatrelying on metadataa format can be converted once into a new format. it is quite possible that the new formatis much simpler to explain than the original one was. this may be a reason to convert once,probably at record ingest time. on the other hand, the new format may be less efficient (withless compression, for example). there is also a risk of error or loss of features in any conversion. the tradeoff must be carefully evaluated. however, converting once does not mean thatthe original file cannot be kept as well.converting the data (once) to xml is starting to be recognized as one approach to thepreservation problem.13 although it is true that xml can play a very efficient role for purposesof preserving information, it is not by itself a panacea. xml is a convention for identifying dataelements in a character string through the use of tags (the particular tags can be chosen to best fitthe particular application). xml per se does not specify what to do with the data; in particular,it does not say how the data should be presented. however, the tags provide a way for otherprograms (such as style sheets), associated with the xml technology, to take care of the presentation by providing a syntax to specify the presentation attributes for each tag (for example: titlein helvetica font, 18point, centered; author in helvetica, 12point, centered; and so on). butxml does not help in preserving the execution of style sheets for the future.12raymond lorie and raymond van diessen. 2005. òlongterm preservation of complex processes.ó paperpresented at image science and technology archiving conference, washington, d.c., april.13for example, the national archives of australia has developed an open source software package that providesa plugin architecture to convert a range of file formatsñsuch as microsoft office and openoffice formats, relational databases, jpeg, gif, tiff, png, and bmpñto xml representations for longerterm access.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.30building an electronic records archive at nararelying on standardsthe fact that a format can be converted once into another format is very useful if the otherformat is so standard and stable that a viewer will remain available òforever.ó desirableproperties of such standard and stable formats include a public definition, broad applicability,compatibility with prior versions, and a slow rate of change. nara has played an importantrole in the development of one such formatñthe draft pdf/a standardñand can continue tohelp promote the development and adoption of formats that have attractive archival properties.relying on a stable virtual machineas explained above, a virtual machine can be used to preserve the decoding of an originalfile. the same applies to a file obtained by an initial conversion of the original file onto a newformat. this may be appropriate when tools are available for extracting all essential information from the original document and storing it in a new format that is simpler to decode.a third general approach to preservation: migrate the format into a new one whenobsolescence threatens the readability of the recordthe third general approach to preservation is what is generally understood by the termòmigration.ó14 each time the configuration of hardware or software is changed in a mannerthat affects the interpretability of a document file, the data and/or the program must bealtered. conversion poses some special challenges for several reasons: (1) it imposes the ongoing burden of assessing the interpretability of formats contained in the archive; (2) it hasunbounded costs, because there is no end to the conversions that need to be done; (3) it mayintroduce errors at each conversion; and (4) features of a record may be lost as they aremapped from one version to another.the third considerationñthe possibility of introducing errorsñis particularly significant.as with other aspects of archive management, human inspection, except on a very sparsesample, will be prohibitively expensive. even if the conversion failure rate is very low, theconsequence of automatic conversion and little or no human checking is to place the burden ofdiscovering errors and recovering from them on the ultimate users of the record. this eventuality is likely to lead the user to fall back on one of the other preservation approaches describedabove.conversion would be more attractive in some particular scenariosñfor example, if theoriginal form of a record is in some version of a very popular, wellcharacterized format suchas pdf (which also happens to be relatively stable, in the backwardcompatibility sense).when that record is migrated to succeeding versions of pdf and then into successor formats,each of these conversions is likely to be highly accurate because society in general invested agreat deal in their being so at the time. moreover, because all earlier (con)versions would havebeen kept in such cases, there would be a window of opportunity (while interpreters for the14note that the term òmigrationó is sometimes defined also to include the refreshing of bit streams onto newstorage media. however, this refreshing is, of course, a fundamental requirement for all three approaches described above.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.ongoing technology change and rising user expectations31last format or two are still available) in which errors could be corrected. (and since òliveóinterpreters would be available for both original and new formats at the time, at least someform of automatic error checking would be possible, such as comparing resulting bitmaps.)a variation on this strategy is migration on access, which postpones the conversion until auser requests a record. this approach has several possible advantages. for example, deferralcan save on resources when most content is rarely accessed; additionally, onthefly conversion makes it more likely that the most uptodate conversion software will be used.15 however, deferral pushes the problem to a time when datatype obsolescence would make it muchmore difficult to develop or validate a converter. also, the advantages of migration on accessare reduced in proportion to the fraction of data types that end up being accessed in the future.growing user expectationsusers of online services, such as ecommerce sites, web search engines, and the like, havedeveloped expectations for nearimmediate access to vast data sets. usersõ expectations for theera will include the following:¥easy, online access to entire collections. users will expect the full contents of digital collections archived by the era to be searchable and accessible online. they will expect access to beavailable on an unmediated basisñthat is, without going through an archivistñthough theymay sometimes seek such assistance. people increasingly expect to be able to locate government information online, and the internet is rapidly becoming the primary channel for accessing government information.16¥free and anonymous nominal access. as with other online government information, userswill expect to be able to search for and access information archived by the era without havingto pay fees or to register. users will be more willing to pay fees for bulk downloads and othersuch services.¥speed. users have come to expect nearinstantaneous response times even when searching databases containing many billions of items (e.g., web search engines and ecommercesites). users are increasingly intolerant of slow response caused by high demand; those providing web services today carefully architect and provision their systems to minimize response time. similar requirements are being placed on government systems.17 capacity planning, performance measurement, and production engineering will need to be done on anongoing basis in order to provide a particular level of quality as public demand scales up. ofcourse, not all access can be provided on an instantaneous basis: much richer data types andmore sophisticated approaches for searching records may require much more processing time.15david s.h. rosenthal et al. 2005. òtransparent format migration of preserved web content.ó dlib magazine11(1).

come to expect the generally high levels of availability that major commercial services provide by investing substantially in redundant systemsand network connections.¥a welldesigned user interface. commercial services offer welldesigned user interfacesthat are continually being refined. users will expect the same of the eraõs interface.¥federated search. users are beginning to expect services that allow them to search acrossmultiple sources of content. for example, search engines such as google provide a federatedsearch across the web, and fedstats.gov provides a federated search across data from u.s.federal statistical agencies. users will, for example, increasingly expect to be able to search forgovernment documents and records regardless of which agency has custody of them.¥appropriate interpretation and processing, not just access to the raw datañsuch as conversionfrom persistent forms into easily usable forms. if users were able to access the nixon tapes onlinetoday, for example, they would expect them to be available in real player or windows mediaplayer format.user demand for certain types of records can also be quite high, exceeding initial projections. a recent instance was the united kingdomõs release in 2002 of the 1901 census data.according to the u.k.õs national archives, the web service was designed to support 1.2million users per day, but demand on the first day was 1.2 million users per hour. the demandcontinued to rise in the days that followed, and the web site had to be taken down so that itscapacity could be significantly increased.18these are demanding expectations. in the list above, the last item in particular anticipatesthat users will expect services that go well beyond the simple delivery of static records on adisk. however, as this report recommends, naraõs priority should be to ingest, manage, andprovide basic access to records. given limited resources, nara cannot afford to meet all ofthese expectations for all recordsñexpectations will need to be reconciled against the notion ofvarying levels of service for different record types. therefore, third parties should be encouraged to develop user services beyond the basic level provided by nara, an option discussedin chapter 3 of this report.other technology trendsfullcontent search and automated metadata extractionone of the major challenges for the era system is that of ingesting the anticipated volumes of records without being bogged down by too much (costly) human effort. somemetadata tell how the records are structured, what kind of records they are, where they camefrom, when they were created, and so onñinformation needed both for the management ofthe records within nara and to help users find records. other metadata, such as

user expectations33indexing terms, have historically been assigned by humans and are used primarily for findingrather than management.several technologies make it possible to avoid the human effort associated with generatingthe second kind of metadata. one approach to reducing this burden is fullcontent searching.there has been considerable progress in this areañthat an enormous body of publicly accessible web pages can be searched effectively by search engines such as google is a majorachievement of relevance to narañand there is widespread demand for better searchingtechnologies.another technique for increasing the degree of automation possible is the use of automaticmetadata extraction. this type of technique involves a wide variety of algorithms and approaches, often referred to as informationextraction techniques, for extracting informationfrom text that is either semistructured or natural language. to take a simple example, suchtechniques enable the sender, recipient, and subject of a memorandum to be extracted automatically even if these items are not explicitly tagged in the document. information extractionappears in a number of production systems, including the following:¥citeseer,19 in which a web crawler monitors university web sites, finds things that itidentifies as research publications or technical reports, and extracts information such as thetitle and author names from the file (usually a pdf and postscript version of the paper), aswell as citations to other papers (at the end of the paper). this system, which has been operational since the late 1990s, is very heavily used in the computer science community.¥whizbang! technologiesõ job search system flipdog (subsequently sold to monster.com), whichcrawled the web looking for job postings and extracted data (e.g., location, salary, and title)from them.20¥google, which uses information extraction to answer search queries such as òwhat isjupiter?ó the first link returned will probably be òweb definitions for jupiter.ó clicking on itdisplays a list of severalsentence definitions that have been extracted from web documentsusing a set of rules for finding things that look like definitions.¥shopbots , which use information extraction of some kind. in the early days most shopbots used handwritten extraction rules, and many probably still do. however, handwrittenrules are fragile, because when a site changes, the handwritten wrappers stop working. thus,there has been much research on automatically learning to extract information from ecommercepages. the details of which algorithms are used by which sites are generally proprietary.19see c.l. giles, k. bollacker, and s. lawrence, 1998, òciteseer: an automatic citation indexing system,ó inproceedings of the 3rd

metadata is categorization, which discernsgroupings of related content.although the techniques discussed here are valuable, they do not always yield correctmetadata. the errors that occur will tend to have a minimal impact on the precision (theproportion of items retrieved that are relevant) of finding aids, although they obviously willreduce recall (the proportion of relevant items retrieved by a search).more complex natural language problems, such as parsing and òunderstanding,ó are quitedifficult and appear likely to remain so. nevertheless, the informationextraction techniquesthat have been developed over a period of several decades have reached a level of maturityallowing their use in production systems when guided by human expertise. although they donot and will not provide the accuracy of a human, they offer the considerable advantages ofimproved speed and reduced 0cost that is several orders of magnitude lower than that formanual processing.building an electronic records

processes35352reengineering processes to meet theelectronic records challengechapter 1 describes factors driving the shift to electronic records and the growing volumeand variety of such records. electronic records offer considerable new flexibility with respectto duplication (perfect digital copies can be made readily and cheaply), transfer (records canbe transferred electronically using networks or physical media), and physical custody (because storage is cheap, it is feasible to maintain multiple copies). many electronic records existwithin information systems, which makes it possible to capture records and associatedmetadata systematically, and to automate their transfer and processing. the properties ofelectronic records support the establishment of new processes and relationships with agenciesfor scheduling and transferring custody of records. the anticipated volume of records thatwill be submitted for archiving compels the use of automated transfer and ingest.this chapter first reviews three national archives and records administration (nara)initiatives that bear on process reengineering. it then points out a number of additional opportunities for nara.recent initiatives of the national archives and recordsadministration related to electronic recordsthrough three major initiativesñthe electronic records archives (era) program, therecords management redesign initiative, and an initiative on records management under theadministrationõs egovernment initiativeñnara has taken a number of steps toward building needed technical capabilities for the archiving and preserving of the federal governmentõselectronic records and toward making associated changes in process.electronic records archivesnaraõs electronic records archives program was begun in 1998. its purpose was toaddress the growing volume and diversity of electronic records being used and relied on bybuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records

address issues of format obsolescence and preservation. afundamental objective of the era program is to confront the formidable challenge of creatinga òsystem that will authentically preserve and provide access to any kind of electronic record,free from dependency on any specific hardware or software.ó1early steps in the era programincluded naraõs exploration of possible solutions and undertaking of development projectswith partners. the partners included the san diego supercomputer center, the university ofmaryland, and the georgia tech research institute.in august 2003, nara released a draft request for proposals2 (rfp) for the era system,òseeking input from industry to ensure that the final rfp clearly communicates the purpose ofthe acquisition.ó3 before preparing this report, the national research councilõs committee ondigital archiving and the national archives and records administration prepared two reports providing advice related to the era acquisition: its first report recommended a strategyfor engineering and acquiring the era using an iterative design approach, and a letter reportprovided specific comments to nara regarding the draft rfp.4 also in august 2003, thegeneral accounting office released a report5that òfound several deficiencies in naraõs planfor the [systemõs] acquisition,ó including the lack of a òconcept of operations for the

was done through an initiative with the ultimate goals of (1) documenting thecurrent recordkeeping and records use environments in the federal government, (2) usingsubsequent findings to analyze naraõs recordsmanagement policies, and (3) redesigning thescheduling, appraisal, and accessioning processes where necessary.with respect to the first of those goals, nara issuedin december 2001 a report preparedfor nara by sra international. the report examined the views and perspectives on recordkeeping and archiving of a sample of federal employees (box 2.1). the results of naraõs ownrecords systems analysesñwhich pointed to the importance of òsituational factorsó withinagency recordsmanagement operationsñwere included in the report, which offered òa number of approaches, options, and interventions that may assist nara and the agencies toimprove federal [records management].ó11building on the work that produced the 2001 report, nara issued a draft proposal in july200212 for rethinking the regulations, policies, and processes for managing federal records andfor developing a set of strategies to support federal records management. a year later, afteròworking with stakeholders and [testing] proposals,ó nara released strategic directions forfederal records management, its òroadmap for redesigning naraõs recordsmanagement program and records management in the federal government.ó13the strategic directions report begins by asserting naraõs goals with respect to its redesign of federal records management before moving on to more specific strategies and tacticsfor reaching those goals. the following are among the reportõs enumerated strategies:¥[nara] will demonstrate that effective records management adds value to agency business processes. . . .¥[naraõs] approach to records management will be based on the iso [international organization for standardization] records management standard 15489.¥[nara] will focus on those records that are

between nara and stakeholders, modifying guidance and training programs, providing assistance to agencies, providing agency oversight, supporting the development ofrecordsmanagement tools, and reengineering naraõs own business processes.recently, nara has also issued several white papers in support of the strategic directionsreport. the white papers focus onñamong other thingsñadvocacy, appraisal policy, certification of training, custody, expansion of the recordsmanagement training program, inspectionsand studies of records management, and resource allocation.15box 2.1major findings of study on current recordkeeping practiceswithin the federal governmentfollowing are the major findings from the 2001 study prepared for the national archives andrecords administration by sra international, inc., on perceptions in the federal governmentwith respect to record keeping:¥the quality and success of recordkeeping varies considerably across the agenciesstudied.¥government employees do not know how to solve the problem of electronic recordsñwhether the electronic information they create constitutes records and, if so, what to dowith the records.¥when agencies have a strong business need for good [recordkeeping], such as thethreat of litigation or an agency mission that revolves around maintaining òcaseó files, then[recordkeeping] practices tend to be relatively strong with regard to the records involved.¥although records officers and other agency records managers are familiar with thelife cycle of records, integration between [recordkeeping] and the business processes ofmany agencies is distinctly lacking.¥for many federal employees, the concept of a òrecordó and what should be scheduled andpreserved is unclear.¥[recordkeeping and records management] in general receive low priority, as evidenced by lack of staff or budget resources, absence of uptodate policies and procedures, lack of training, and lack of accountability.¥while agencies appreciate specific assistance from nara personnel, they are frustrated because they perceive that nara is not meeting agenciesõ broad needs for guidance and [records management] leadership. primarily, agencies want timely and responsive guidance and leadership from nara on current [records management] issues.source: national archives and records administration. 2001. an overview of three projects relating

electronic records management (erm) initiative was launched as part of thebush administrationõs egovernment agenda. this initiative is intended to provide òpolicyguidance to help [federal] agencies . . . better manage their electronic records, so that recordsinformation can be . . . used to support timely and effective decision making, enhance servicedelivery, and ensure accountability.ó the erm òwill provide the tools that agencies will needto manage their records in electronic form, addressing specific areas of electronic recordsmanagement where agencies are having major difficulties.ó16the erm initiative was started with the following three goals in mind:1.to integrate erecordsmanagement concepts and practices with comprehensive informationmanagement policies, processes, and objectives in order to assure the integrity of erecords and information;2.to employ erm to support interoperability, timely and effective decision making, andimproved services to customers; and3.to provide the tools for agencies to access erecords for as long as required and totransfer permanent erecords to nara for preservation and future use by government andcitizens.as the managing agency for the erm initiative, nara has organized the project into fourissue areas:1.correspondence tracking,2.enterprisewide erm (to provide tools for agencies to use as they plan and implementerm systems),3.electronic informationmanagement standards (to promote governmentwide use of thedepartment of defense 5015.2 standard for records management for federal agencies), and4.transfer of permanent electronic records to nara (to address an expansion of both thenumber of formats that nara can accept and the media and techniques that can be used byfederal agencies when transferring their permanently valuable electronic records to nara).the overall erm initiative includes a number of deliverables. for example, nara hasexpanded the acceptable methods for transferring electronic records to nara, and it hasissued guidance for transferring permanent electronic records of the following types: emailrecords (including attachments), web content records, scanned images of textual records,digital photography records, digital geospatial data records, and records in portable document format.16naraõs overview of the electronic records management initiative, available online at

recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.40building an electronic records archive at naraprocess reengineering to realize era goalsoutlined below are broad areas of process reengineering that will be important to thesuccess of the era and, more generally, to naraõs success in handling electronic records.automated ingestexisting processes for ingesting records rely heavily on manual processes. paper recordsnaturally require a good deal of manual processing to acquire and appraise. current procedures for transferring electronic records also involve significant manual intervention, startingwith the effort associated with creating and organizing metadata into finding aids and thetransfer of physical media or the initiation of a network file transfer. similarly, appraisal anddescription require significant manual effort, including such steps as manually examiningrecord structures and capturing metadata.as outlined in chapter 1, the volume of electronic materials will grow substantially andrapidly. at the same time, a major increase in naraõs budget for archiving appears unlikely.the only possible resolution in order for the era system to be able to handle the anticipatedvolume of records is to make a major shift to automation. fortunately, it is possible to makethis change by improving how records are delivered to nara, by establishing proceduresand systems to ingest new records automatically on a routine basis, and by capturing metadataat record creation and using automatic techniques to help fill in gaps.to make the automation effort successful, it will be critical to establish how to handleerrors that occur in the ingest process. this is important because the costs of exception handling are a common reason for the failure of automation. careful consideration should begiven to the amount of effort that should be expended on trying to fix problems, on the extentto which the responsibility for resolving problems can be pushed back to the originatingagency, on ways that errors can be corrected in the future when they are discovered byarchives users, and so forth.even as nara develops capabilities and processes to handle new records through automation, a considerable backlog of electronic records will continue to grow before these new measures take full effect. to avoid being swamped by the backlog, triage measures may be needed.these could include avoiding significant manual processing, preserving the obvious artifactsthat would support the extraction of automatic metadata in the future (e.g., when accepting email, it is important also to receive the mapping from email address to personal directoryinformation), and using automatic metadata extraction (and accepting its shortcomings).early processing or ingest of recordsthe ingest of electronic records decades after their creation can be problematicalñobsoletedata and metadata formats may be difficult to interpret, and it may be quite difficult to modifythe systems in which the records reside so as to facilitate ingest. when the originating systemsare still active, preservation problems can be tackled before obsolescence.one way to mitigate problems at record ingest is to conduct dryrun testing (runningthrough all of the steps that would be taken at ingest, conducting the dry run over full sets ofrecords, or using a sample as a spot check). such testing allows a number of potential problems to be uncovered and resolved, including the following: are the data and metadata forbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.reengineering processes41mats known, and can they be processed by the eraõs (automated) ingest process? is appropriate information as to the recordõs authenticity and integrity available? are access and transmission procedures in place at the creating agency and at nara to effect ingest? this type ofsystem debugging serves as an early warning of problems.another option is the early capture of records in anticipation of future custody transfer tonara. unlike paper records, electronic records offer considerable new flexibilityñcopies arereadily made and cheaply stored. early capture is best done by designing systems that generate permanent records so that records are created archiveready at birthñautomatically recording metadata, providing users with very easy ways to create metadata manually as recordsare created, and designing systems that produce outputs that are easy to interpret, selfdescribing, and otherwise well suited for longterm preservation.òpulló technologiesñsuch as automated download of records and web harvestingñareone way to routinely obtain records earlier in their life cycle. this technique is not limited topublicly accessible records. for example, an agency could provide a restrictedaccess webservice for nara to use to extract records as they are created or to search the agencyõs internalrecordkeeping system. the resulting archival copies might also provide additional incentivesfor agencies to support the creation of archiveready records and their delivery to nara,since these records would then serve as offsite backups of agency operational systems.thus, there are two almostidentical techniques: a passive one in which nara is sentrecords early, on a provisional basis, for purposes of a dry run; and an active one in whichnara extracts and ingests records. both give early warning. the active mode is probablyharder for agencies (and nara) to implement, but it gives nara the greatest visibility intothe records that it will have to handle. the active approach also provides the potential incentive of naraõs copies serving as a backup.appraisal, selection, and description of electronic recordsarchival practice was developed primarily to handle paper and other tangiblemediarecords. however, several trends over the past three decades have made it more difficult tocarry out traditional records scheduling and disposition activities:¥new ways of working that supplant the traditional organizational hierarchy with greateruse of teams, task forces, and so on that are project or goaloriented, rather than procedureoriented;¥the reduction in administrative and clerical staff responsible for organizing, filing, andretrieving records and developing retention and disposition schedules, and the resulting transfer of responsibility for record management to enduser agency staff;¥the preference for electronic communication and record keeping over paperbased systems; and¥the dearth of useful tools that can integrate records management into enduser tasksand activities.at the same time, several technology trends compel a rethinking of selection, appraisal,and description in two major areas:building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.42building an electronic records archive at nara¥first, the granularity of appraisal should be larger. the appraisal of physical records wasdriven in part by a need to reduce significant storage costs in an archive. but with everdeclining storage costs, the opposite is the case with digital information. investing time inreducing a set of records by 10 percent or 40 percent or even 60 percent costs more than itsaves, because these decisions require human intervention and professional judgment andresearch. also, records are more interconnected when they are digital. the information orevidential value of a set of records considered in isolation may not be obvious, but one set ofrecords may be crucial for understanding or using another set.rather than examining sets of records carefully and marking only a select few for retention, it may become more expedient and more appropriate to retain larger òchunksó of records,the committee is not advocating a òsave everythingó approach, but a rethinking of selectioncriteria. for example, it may be better to preserve entire classes of electronic records (e.g., all ofthe records from certain offices, all of the records covering function x in both the federal andregional offices, and so on) that would not have been feasible for paper records, even thoughsome records with little permanent value may be intermingled. nara appears to be movingin this direction in the records management redesign initiative, with its emphasis on functional appraisal, which implicitly is more broadly granular.consider a specific example. for the material that will be included in the u.s. departmentof stateõs new smart system, nara currently has more than 2,000 retention and dispositionschedules for series of records with various retention periods. it might be much more costeffective simply to keep everything from this system, or to replace the current fine level ofappraisal and disposition with one that has fewer than a dozen schedules.¥second, archives should place less emphasis on manual record description of records and oncreation of finding aids and more on automated tools for improving access. the characteristics ofelectronic records permit new access methods that can decrease the burden on archivists todescribe records and create finding aids. agencies can supply records in a structured formatand attach metadata. fullcontent search on the records and associated metadata can supplementñor even supplantñmanually generated finding aids. finally, agencies themselves create search and access tools for some of their records. such tools might be maintained by theoriginating agency (perhaps as part of the sort of agreement to distribute archiving responsibility, as discussed below) or adapted for use by nara.another way to think about the tradeoffs discussed here is that it may be advisable inmany cases to make access for end users (when and if it occurs) potentially more difficult (byincreasing the total volume of records to be examined and describing records in less detail) inexchange for making ingest cheap (by reducing the burden on the archivist to select anddescribe materials). of course, as tools such as fullcontent search improve, the burden on theend user will be reduced.delivering records archivereadyelectronic records transfer to nara and their ingest are greatly eased if records can besupplied to nara òarchiveready.ó archiveready records, at a minimum, are packaged withthe metadata required for them to be transferred and otherwise processed using largely automated processes. preferably, archiveready records would also be provided in structured,standardized formats approved by nara as amenable to longterm preservation.the closer to record creation that archive readiness is established, the more likely it is thatbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.reengineering processes43the appropriate metadata will be captured. this means that less work (and cost) will beincurred in adding the information later. ideally, agencies would design systems so thatrecords are created archiveready at birth. this condition would occur through automaticrecording of metadata, agencies providing their own staff members with very easy ways tomanually create metadata as records are created, and so forth. alternatively, agencies can addnecessary metadata at some point after creation, but then still deliver records to nara archiveready.if a large fraction of the records delivered to nara are to be archiveready in the long run,archiving considerations will have to become part of the government software procurementand development process. this is especially true for those systems that produce or are deemedlikely to produce permanent records. successful implementation of the era system may alsorequire nara to become more actively involved in the establishment of standards used inconstructing federal systems, such as those governing the formats used to represent recordsand associated metadata, and for narañor other bodies responsible for information policy,such as the office of management and budgetñto establish guidance to agencies and auditingand enforcement measures as necessary.as a practical matter, these efforts should link archiveready concerns with agency interests in supporting the agenciesõ own recordkeeping operations. experience shows the difficulty of implementing systems that depend on user compliance with externally imposedrequirements that necessitate effort and do not support the userõs internal business needs. asa result, requirements should support agency recordkeeping needs, and implementing therecords should be realistically possible. experience also shows that schemes that depend onusersupplied metadata are unlikely to succeed, meaning that software and systems that minimize additional manual contributions of metadata are more likely to succeed.close coordination will also be needed between the records management design initiativeand the era program, because if changes along the lines of those envisioned in the rmi do notoccur, the flow of records into the era will be seriously impeded. the amount of work thatnara would then need to do to make the records useful would be unsustainable.metadata collectionas discussed above, metadata describing electronic records can and should be createdwith as little recourse to manual description as possible. it is useful to distinguish three waysin which metadata can be collected automatically:1.metadata can be collected as a matter of course when a record is created (or by virtue of the seriesor collection in which it lies). for example, a word processor may automatically attach metadataidentifying the author and last modification date (assuming that the system is correctly configured with such information).2.metadata can be automatically extracted from a record without any recourse to informationextraction or otherwise òunderstandingó the record. for example, header information in an emailmessage is readily extracted by parsing the message.3.metadata can be automatically extracted from a record using informationextraction or categorization techniques. as discussed in chapter 1, these techniques are imperfect, but they can beexpected to improve with time.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm

ideally, agency recordkeeping systems would have facilities for automaticcapture built in. the second option is also easy and inexpensive for records that have thenecessary structure.the third option should be viewed as a fallback. even when it is necessary to use automaticmetadataextraction techniques, this is better done early on, by the creating agency, whichmay be able to use contentspecific techniques.in cases in which nara will have to resort to automatic metadata extraction using naturallanguage techniques, it will have to accept significant imperfection in some of its metadataña shift from the traditional mindset of archival institutions. it will also be necessary forsystems and processes to distinguish among different degrees of quality in the metadata,which have varying reliability. finally, as metadata extraction techniques improve, themetadata can be upgraded (possibly onthefly as records are accessed). the era shouldaccommodate making such updates to record descriptors.cooperative arrangements with agenciesthe increased flexibility afforded by electronic records opens up a number of options forcustody and access in partnership between nara and federal agencies. the model of havingcertain agencies retain responsibility for certain types of records is well established; for example, several agencies have been given the responsibility for preserving large scientific datasets. nara policy has established criteria for determining whether to establish such an affiliated archive.17 in 2003, nara entered into a new partnership with the u.s. governmentprinting office (gpo) which makes the gpo an òarchival affiliate.ó18 the agreement ensuresthe permanent availability of the documents available today (and in the future) through thegpo access web site, which provides online public access to more than 250,000 publications,including the congressional record, federal register, and code of federal regulations. the agreement gives nara legal custody of the documents while delegating to gpo the responsibilityfor public access and preservation. users are directed from naraõs catalogs to documentsheld for access and preservation by gpo.this approach has several important advantages:¥by leveraging the skills and resources of other agencies for preservation and access,nara can spend its scarce resources on problems that agencies cannot address on their own.¥giving an agency responsibility for the preservation and access of records means thatthe specialized expertise required to understand or manage a complex system need not betransferred to nara. for example, the u.s. census bureau currently provides public access tosurvey data through a web interface and supporting analysis software. it would be impractical to expect nara to develop domain expertise sufficient to operate online access to all formsof government data.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.reengineering processes45¥it provides a clear path for nara to identify permanently valuable essential evidencefrom a governmentwide perspective, and it also enables agencies to make independent judgments as to whatever else they want to retain for their own purposes.¥diversity of responsibility is created with multiple agencies taking on the responsibilityof preservation, and this diversity provides some additional measure of safety compared tothat afforded by a monolithic repository.¥by banding together, nara and other organizations stand a much better chance ofspreading widely the standards and tools for preparing records that are archiveready, ofdeveloping affordable software to meet the needs of researchers and other clients of theserepositories, and of otherwise making electronic records archives practical in the long run.despite these advantages to cooperative arrangements, there is a potential downside to adistributed set of archives. if systems proliferate and diverge, users of affiliated archives willbe frustrated by different user interfaces, different access or authorization requirements, anddifferent implementation of services (such as downloading electronic records). to increase theutility to users, the affiliates should federate search and authorization techniques and coordinate their services.if such arrangements become more common, naraõs role would shift to that of a standardssetter, federator, troubleshooter, and repository of last resort.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.46building an electronic records archive at nara463partnering with other institutionsthe national archives and records administration (nara) need not go it alone in providing services to its users. naraõs work with electronic records affords a number of opportunities to leverage and partner with other organizations, commercial firms, and researchersto provide access to nara collections. designing the electronic records archives (era) tofeature public interfaces can enable much broader use of nara holdings. the inclusion ofappropriate application programming interfaces (apis) in the era design would enable thirdparties to access records and to provide access services that are layered on top of the naraprovided records and access understructure. federation would allow collections held bynara and other organizations to be accessed as if they were a single collection. this chapterbriefly describes ways of partnering with other institutions and technologies that would makesuch partnerships possible.application programming interfacesan application programming interface allows access to selected system internal data oroperations, enabling people to build new interfaces or applications on top of naraõs systems.apis would allow third parties to do such things as run queries against nara holdings(catalogs or content) and retrieve individual records. a good example of the potential of openapi access is illustrated in the commercial arena by the search service google. simple apilevel access to its search engine is provided to anyone who registers, letting others spend theirown research resources developing applications that might eventually be interesting or usefulto google.capabilities that might be built on top of the era include the following:¥data annotation to add and/or correct record metadata. third parties with an interest inparticular records could provide services to annotate recordsñusing systems separate fromthe era but accessible to users as if they were part of it. these annotations could be held bybuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.partnering with other institutions47external parties (provided there was a way for third parties to point to era records unambiguously, e.g., via a unique identifier), or the era could hold and provide access to theoverlays.1¥the continued introduction of specialized enhanced capabilities by partners and vendors tosupport particular needs. for example, a third party or nara might supply an interface thatprovides translations of popular audio recordings (e.g., the nixon white house tapes) fromthe format in which they are archived into commonly used formats (e.g., windows media orreal audio). some of these capabilities might prove useful enough to be folded back into theera system proper.¥entrepreneurial innovation to provide valueadded services, through either apis or bulk download. today, for example, third parties provide valueadded access to information in the securities and exchange commissionõs electronic data gathering, analysis, and retrieval(edgar) system. similarly, commercial third parties currently provide enhanced access toold data of the u.s. census bureau.¥educational materials. overlays onto nara holdings could be a relatively low costmethod of dramatically providing a new set of services that satisfy naraõs educationalmission. educational publishers, as well as historians and social scientists, could developonline materials that draw on nara holdings.such capabilities would allow nara to tap at low cost the resources of third parties in orderto provide enhanced services, help fulfill naraõs mission, increase the perceived value ofnaraõs holdings, and explore new technologies and approaches.in allowing such capabilities to be built on top of the era, nara will have to consider theproblem of how a typical user distinguishes between results that are provided directly fromnara and those produced via a thirdparty extension. it would probably not be practical fornara to certify thirdparty software or services. however, nara may want to find ways ofletting users know when they are using nara versus thirdparty software and services,because the guarantees that nara would make about the authenticity of what is viewed inthe two cases would be very different.additionally, support for bulk download of records should be provided by nara toallow third parties to retrieve sets of records against which to run their own fullcontentsearches, perform data mining, and so forth. and an additional design issue that wouldfacilitate thirdparty access is the adoption within the era of a persistent (i.e., stable anddurable) recordidentifier scheme.federationfederation is a technique whereby a software layer is used to make a collection of relatively different systemsñwhich are often controlled administratively by different organiza1the overlay concept also has application internally within nara. for example, thomson west undertakes torebuild the full index for the westlaw databases only every 10 to 15 years. between rebuilds, it augments the indexwith new information, some generated automatically, some manually. the system is structured so that a querycollects information from all of these sourcesñthe original index and the subsequent overlays. nara could acceptoverlaid annotations from partners to add value to its holdings.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.48building an electronic records archive at narations and often integrated looselyñappear to be a single system.2 federation has technical(e.g., the definition of standards for the federation layer and connection to the systems belowthe federation layer) and organizational (e.g., agreement on standards and the forging ofagreements to federate holdings) dimensions.applications of federation to the era would include the following:¥federated access. there are several reasons why federated access to electronic recordscollections held by nara and other organizations would be an attractive capability. first, itwould provide a common interface to federal records regardless of which agency happened tohave responsibility for managing them, allowing responsibility for electronic records preservation to be distributed among multiple agencies without giving up the advantages of acommon access point for users. for example, users could retrieve in a single query recordsheld by nara as well as agency records that had not yet been transferred to nara. federated access would also be valuable, for example, in allowing access to span nara and presidential library resources. another example would be enabling seamless access across multiplesystems containing archived and active data. for example, someone searching for data aboutthe snake river would otherwise have to look across many u.s. federal agencies (e.g., thebureau of indian affairs, the environmental protection agency, the department of the interior, and the library of congress), and the archives and agency records of four states (wyoming, idaho, oregon, and washington) as well as nara, all of which might have relevantrecords. with agreement on how to federate, access could be enabled across nara and thearchives and other holdings of international, state, and local archives, libraries, and otherinstitutions.¥federation of archival systems. more generally, it may prove useful to federate the ingest ofrecords, their access, and other functions across multiple archival systems. this arrangementwould provide a way to combine multiple instances of the era, allow simultaneous operationof multiple versions of hardware and software, and generally avoid having to maintain asingle monolithic archival system.¥federated storage. placing a federation layer between an archival system and its filestorage is a very useful technique. among its benefits are that file systems at multiple sites canbe treated the same by software using the file system, and new implementations of file systems(or storage types) can be added to the system as it evolves. old file systems, no longer used,can easily be removed.federation is a mainstream design approach employed in a number of commercial applications today. databases are routinely federated, usually at the structured query language(sql) level, in industry. federated file systems (the san diego supercomputer center storagerequest broker3 is one example) similarly appear in a variety of production systems today.the z39.50 information retrieval protocol4 is used to support federated crosslibrary searches.following are some other examples of applications that use federation:2by contrast, the term òdistributedó usually means multiple instances of identical or similar systems, oftenunder a single administrative control, often tightly integrated. the terms òfederatedó and òdistributedó label endpoints in a spectrum.3a detailed description is available online at <http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/>. accessed may 1, 2005.4ansi/niso z39.50ñ2003 information

systems. it is not just a portal providing access to multiple sites, but an actual federationof several airline reservation systems.¥identity servers managing identity in computer systems. in such an application, a (corporate)user logs on to a single identity server; that server then prepares credentials for variousinformation technology (it) systems when asked by the it system, using whatever credentialtypes the particular it system requires. the liberty alliance is an industry group working tobuild federated identity capabilities.¥new designs federating mail servers. with such a federation, when one queries a set of email folders (e.g., in a large email archive), the folders residing on different email servers willbe searched within their respective servers, but the results will be consolidated. this form offederation involves only a single product, so it is simpler than a federation in which thefederated systems run different software (in such a case, the federation interfaces must becarefully defined).despite the use of federation in various commercial applications today, there is no common way to federate access to electronic records archives or digital libraries. there is alreadya significant technology base to draw on, including metasearch technologies and standardssuch as the z39.50 information retrieval protocol and the open archives initiative protocolfor metadata harvesting.5 there is, however, no established base of practice for federatingaccess to archives. as nara and other organizatons start building such archives, federation isa technical area in which nara might become a leader or engage the research community byinforming it of its needs. if nara is to take advantage of these opportunities, it will also haveto address policy issues involved with allowing its resources to participate in federations (thatmight be run by groups other than nara).5additional information is available online at

program of the national archives and recordsadministration (nara), currently being undertaken to build significant new capabilities forpreserving digital records, has contracted out for two system designs in preparation for theacquisition of an operational system. as a prelude and ongoing complement to procurementactivities, the era program has sponsored several research and development (r&d) activities(box 4.1). this chapter examines the role that future research could play in helping narabetter understand and address emerging and future technology issues and medium and longterm technical challenges.rationale for supporting researchinformation technology (it) research has traditionally been concentrated in several federalagencies, many of which have research as part of their central mission.1 a recent nationalresearch council (nrc) report, information technology research, innovation, and egovernment,2broadly considers the rationale for it research by a broader set of federal mission agencies. itconcludes that, where possible, government should follow the private sector in designing and1twelve agencies or major units of agencies were participants in 2004 in the national coordination office forinformation technology research and development, which coordinates activities and prepares an annual summary of the federal it r&d budget. these were the national institute of

government records, in which government requirements differ, at least somewhat, from those in the commercial world. in these areas, the reportsays, federal agencies should recognize and act on their role as a demand leader.the nrc report goes on to characterize some of the benefits of research activities for bothgovernment agency sponsors and researchers. government stands to benefit from collaboration between government agencies and the it research community despite the fact that thesetwo groups are at opposite ends of an extensive supply chain that also includes vendors andsystem integrators. although government agencies and researchers may appear to be unlikelyallies, they have a shared interest in innovation and in meeting future needs.through research, agencies can gain an understanding of emerging and future technologies, and of the technology risks they face. the most effective form of risk reduction occurswhen an organization does inhouse testing of research prototypes; with inhouse testing theorganization gains firsthand experience about what is easy and what is not, where the systemis reliable and where it fails, and how to run the system on a daily basis. a somewhatlessbox 4.1list of electronic records archives research projectsthe web site of the electronic records archives program lists the following as current research projects:¥persistent

external organization develops and tests theprototype; in this case the organization learns something, but most of the expertise about howthe system really works resides within the external research organization. agencies also gainan opportunity to influence the trajectory of technologies through engagement with researchers. research should, however, not be seen as a way of shortcircuiting the it supply chain ofresearchers, technology vendors, and system integrators, and agencies should not necessarilybe early adopters. however, when agencies and researchers work together, the overall risk ofinnovation in acquisition can be reduced.absorptive capacity for research results requires inhouse people who can be engaged at atechnical level with relevant research communities and who will take results from the researchers, test them inhouse, and explain and propagate results within the agency. merefunding is not enough. the real goal is substantive technical coupling between the researchcommunity and the agency that allows the organization to learn about new technologies, tolearn more broadly about a research area than it would otherwise, and to understand how toapply research that it is not itself supporting.research management for agencies without a track record insponsoring research in information technologyfor an agency such as nara that has neither a long track record of sponsoring it researchnor a large research budget, how can limited research resources be spent most effectively?information technology research, innovation, and egovernment observes that most federal agencies have limited experience in and capability for managing it research programs. the reportgoes on to recommend that consideration be given to crossagency collaboration with agenciesthat already have it research programs and/or that share common research interests.partners with research management expertiseseveral federal agencies, most notably the national science foundation (nsf) and thedefense advanced research projects agency (darpa), but also the national institute ofstandards and technology, the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa), thedepartment of energy, the national institutes of health and its national library of medicine,the armed services laboratories, and others, have extensive expertise in the management of itresearch projects. the selection of specific research proposals and routine management of theresearch processñfor example, selecting among peerreviewed it research proposals or maintaining an armõslength relationship with research organizationsñare capabilities that theseagencies have developed over time as they have gained experience, identified and workedwith particular research communities, brought in researchers to manage programs, and otherwise developed research management talent. these organizations maintain relationships withvaried research and user communities, which gives them easy access to a wide range ofexpertise and peer review when needed.the agencies referred to above also have experience in launching research programs innew areas, including the building of a research community around a set of technical topics thatwere not previously identified as related or important. this process is more complicated thansimply stating a problem and looking for people to work on it. researchers will not be drawnbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.broadening research interactions53to work on problems that are not well thought out, for example, or that are shallow or shortterm enough that they do not lead to significant research results (e.g., sufficient for the promotion of academics or the funding of startup companies). strong, successful research communities often are developed by several customers and funders. the digital libraries programmanaged by nsf is a highly relevant example of successful program development and community building.exchanging staff for limited assignments is a way of both learning about relevant researchand letting others learn about oneõs own research needs. nara staff members could spendprofitable 6month assignments in other research organizations to learn what is on the cuttingedge and let the researchers know what naraõs problems are. similarly, members of researchorganizations could spend profitable 6month assignments inside nara learning what narais really up against and offering suggestions on how to apply what they know to these problems.partners with shared research interestsmany of naraõs most basic needs for digital preservation and access are shared to varying degrees with organizations such as the library of congress, the national library of medicine, nasa, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa), and the intelligence agencies, all of which must maintain indefinite access to digital records. the library ofcongress has established the national digital information infrastructure and preservationprogram (ndiipp) to work collaboratively with federal agencies, research libraries, and otherorganizations that have an interest and expertise in digital preservation. it has partnered withthe national science foundation to establish a research grant program focused on digitalpreservation and has launched joint research activities with four universities to investigatevarious approaches to digital preservation using a test collection.a number of the technical problems faced by nara are likely to be faced by other agencies as well. for example, semiautomatic redaction or declassification is a topic that could beinvestigated with partners such as darpa or the intelligence communityõs advanced research and development activity (arda). another organization with shared interests inpreservation is the department of veterans affairs, which is currently developing thehealthevetvista program to provide longterm access to veteransõ electronic health records(box 4.2).partnership on researchoriented prototypesas nara becomes engaged with a broader range of research communities, it will benatural for it to participate in researchoriented prototypes. the national science foundationõsdigital government program has, for example, fostered close relationships between universities and agencies such as the bureau of labor statistics, the census bureau, and the environmental protection agency. nsfõs digital libraries program has fostered similar governmentand academic partnerships. these partnerships give the research community access to realdata and users and thus an opportunity to receive realworld feedback about their research. inreturn, government agencies gain experience with new technologies before the innovationsbecome commercially available, and the agencies develop longterm relationships with outside experts. such partnerships and inhouse testing of research prototypes should eventuallybecome an important part of naraõs research portfolio.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.54building an electronic records archive at naraengaging the research community through meansother than funding researchnara can engage relevant research communities in a number of ways other than directsponsorship of research. they include the following:¥hosting workshops and seminars. workshops and seminars bring researchers and naraemployees together, allowing a twoway exchange of ideas and problems. the era programtook advantage of this opportunity by holding a november 2004 conference, called òpartnerships in innovation: serving a networked nation,ó organized in conjunction with the university of marylandõs institute for advanced computer studies.¥hiring students. another way of engaging research communities is to seek out and hiretheir students. this is well understood in industry as a very effective approach to technologytransfer.¥suggesting important problems and providing access to artifacts (data, software, and systemcapabilities) and subjectmatter experts. as the nrc report information technology research, innovation, and egovernment observes, working on government it problems offers researchersaccess to applications with a òrichness and texture often lacking in the laboratoryó as well asother potential benefits.3box 4.2healthevetvistahealthevetvista is a program currently under design. it will create an online environment inwhich veteransõ electronic health records, medical images such as xrays, pathology slides,scanned documents, results of cardiology examinations, wound photos, and endoscopies,among other records, are stored for ready access.currently, the department of veterans affairs (va) treats more than 3 million patients annually in more than 1,300 health units, 163 hospitals, and 850 clinics. the committee on veteransõaffairs of the u.s. house of representatives has mandated that the va retain all veteransõhealth records (which are in electronic form) for 75 years after the death of veterans. giventechnology obsolescence, this mandated retention period creates an enormous challenge forthe va. the va also faces a comparable challenge in standardizing veteransõ electronic healthrecords across all of its components and in implementing òupstreamó creation and capture ofveteransõ electronic health records that facilitate access for 75 years or more.setting aside the commitment of the national archives and records administration (nara) topermanent storage (i.e., forever) of selected electronic records created by federal agencies, theva and nara face a comparable challenge over the next hundred years in ensuring longtermaccess to electronic records. the two agencies also share common interests in approaches,tools, and procedures to support longterm access to electronic records.3computer science and telecommunications board, national research council.

administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.broadening research interactions55the opportunity of providing researchers with access to artifacts is discussed in moredetail in the following subsection.providing access to artifactsas a complement to sponsoring research, nara can also engage the research communityby providing data. this opportunity represents a very low cost yet effective way of engagingsubstantively with the research community. academic researchers are often starved for data;they have good ideas, but no way to test them against reality. providing interesting data in aform that the research community can use can be enough to get the best people in the worldworking on a problem, essentially for free. for example, reuters created two databases ofcategorized newswire articles for research use and made them easy to acquire. almost everytext classification algorithm developed in the preceding decade was tested on these data sets,and hundreds of research papers have been published about them, none paid for by reuters.similar stories can be told about data sets from news organizations such as the wall streetjournal, ap newswire, ziffdavis, and the financial times, and about medical data sets basedon the national library of medicineõs medline system.there are many vehicles for providing data to the research community. since 1992 thenational institute of standards and technology (nist) has created a variety of widely useddata sets that have focused research attention on a diverse set of problems, often of interest tothe u.s. intelligence community. some universities, for example the university of california atirvine and the university of pennsylvania, have specialized in creating and becoming longterm distributors of research data sets. partnering with an organization that has prior experience in this area, such as nist, the university of california at irvine, or the linguistic dataconsortium (ldc) at the university of pennsylvania, would help nara learn how to createdata sets that are engaging and have longterm value to various research communities.chapter 3 in this report points out the benefits of providing an application programminginterface (api) that gives direct access to some of the eraõs digital archive so that third partiescan develop new tools. this approach is particularly applicable to research initiatives. google,for example, allows a simple apilevel access to its search engine to anyone who registers. theadvantage to google is that others can spend their own research dollars to develop applications that might eventually be interesting or useful to google. apilevel access can also provide access to users, enabling researchers to conduct experiments with live populations in realtimeñfor example, by varying system characteristics and observing user behavior. such access would be extremely attractive to a variety of computer science and social science researchcommunities, and it could be provided by nara at relatively low cost relative to the benefitsobtained.research challenges facing the national archives andrecords administrationthe research problems facing narañand appropriate research strategiesñfall into twocategories:1.problems shared with other organizations. many of naraõs technical problems are thesame as those faced by designers and operators of any large digital library or repository. forbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.56building an electronic records archive at naradealing with these problems, naraõs greatest leverage will come from drawing on researchsponsored by other organizations, learning about best practices, inducing others to work onproblems of interest to nara by offering corpora of content that researchers can use to testnew ideas, and participating in joint research programs with other federal agencies and organizations that face similar challenges. wherever technologies may be shared with other applications, partnerships to jointly address shared problems will help stretch limited researchresources.2.problems specific to government archives and similar institutions. a few problems are specific to the preservation of records or otherwise unique to nara and may need separateresearch thrusts. working on these more specialized problems may require specific engagement with existing research communities. partnership with agencies that have greater experience in managing it research programs is also likely to be the most effective mechanism foraddressing this class of research problems.what are some of the specific research problems that nara faces? the organization mustdevelop its own list, but it need not start from scratch in doing so.4 the subsections belowprovide some illustrative examples of research problems in each class.research problems shared with other organizationsfollowing is a list of examples of research problems that nara shares with other organizations, together with appropriate strategies.¥automatic classification. traditional archiving processes rely heavily on controlledvocabulary metadata, which is usually assigned manually. largescale use of automatic categorization to assign metadata provides a way to handle the expected flood of digital records in acosteffective manner. there has been significant progress in this technology area during thepast decade, and there is now a greater understanding of what makes problems òdifficultó andòeasy.ó automatic categorization, which is used routinely in a variety of commercial settings,is often as accurate as human categorization is. automatic categorization must become a corecompetency for nara. human effort should be applied only when automatic solutions areinadequate. the use of this technology can be broadened to related problems such as filteringrecords for retention and distinguishing between federal and presidential records.engagement with leaders in the research community would provide nara an opportunity to better understand the state of the art. naraõs contributions in this case might well notinvolve direct support for research; nara

better tools and are likely tobe continually pressing the limits of technology. for example, google already offers a ògooglescholaró search designed to find online scholarly material, and libraries and technical literature publishers are beginning to offer customized searching. many of these emerging techniques will probably be useful to scholars searching the era, but the archives may pose someunique problems. this is a case in which nara could stimulate a research community with adatabase of archival records and a set of demanding users with specific needs.¥preserving computer programs. improved capabilities for preserving software may be ofgeneral interest to the community interested in digital preservation, including nara, butthey may or may not be required by nara to preserve records. here a modest level offunding in a jointly funded program of research looking broadly at digital preservation problems might be appropriate.¥how to preserve web sites. government web sites publish information in a wide variety offormats, use static and dynamic information, use information from a single source or manysources, and present general or userspecific views of information. government web sites alsocollect information from the publicñfor example, public comments on proposed regulations.what government web site material should be archived? the variety of problems posed bygovernment web sites could be viewed as daunting, but it can also be an advantage in that thesites afford a means to gather much valuable information. of course not all web sites produceunique òrecordsó; some are merely access portals to an underlying set of records that may bearchived in other ways. web sites should be a particular priority for archiving because they areso dynamic and also because they provide information that may not be captured by otherarchiving processes. an essential part of the national historical record may have simply beenlost because government web sites were not systematically archived in the past decade. (serious efforts aimed at archiving web content, however, are being made by such organizations asthe internet archive.) nara will need to codevelop policies and technical approaches forhandling web sites.¥the interplay between information technology and human and organizational behavior related torecords. nara, like many other organizations, has an interest in understanding how peopleand organizations use new technologies and an interest in the implications of this use for newforms of communication, new types of records, and new divisions of responsibilities for administrative and recordkeeping activities. relevant areas of research include businessprocess redesign, organizational restructuring as a result of new information technologies, adoption and adaptation of new technologies, work flow analysis and design, compliance withpolicies and requirements, and design of incentive mechanisms.problem areas in which nara and similar institutions have special interests¥how to tease out (or define) records in interactive systems. interactions with and withingovernment increasingly involve ephemeral views not stored as records but merely computedfrom online databases through software that itself changes over time. web sites (discussedabove) are one important example.¥transactions systems. how should government transactions systems be preserved? arethere

research challenges related to the general topic of archiving and digital preservation, nara has to decide how and where it should invest. questions for nara to considerinclude these: what agencies share an interest in naraõs problem or a similar problem? whatresearch community is working on that problem or a similar problem? how can nara mosteffectively join with and influence that community? does nara need to sponsor its ownresearch, or can it learn from or participate in othersõ research programs? what results areanticipated, and how will the results be brought back to nara?as the era starts to operate, nara will surely uncover new problems. some of theproblems will lead to evolution of the system and its operation in straightforward waysñthatis, known methods or engineering techniques will solve them. but operation may also revealdeeper problems worthy of new research activities.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration:

concerned with the authenticity and integrity of its holdings. anòauthenticó record is, loosely, one that is what it purports to be: it was duly issued by anauthorized person or agency. a record has òintegrityó if it is preserved without any alterationthat would impair its use as an authentic record.the issue of digital record assurance, the topic of this chapter, is discussed in greater detailthan are other technical issues in this report for two reasons. first, the committee did notaddress this topic in depth in its first report, which emphasized other system design andrelated acquisition issues. second, digital assurance is an area in which correct implementation requires great care.to ensure the authenticity and integrity of paper records, archivists have worked outtechniques such as establishing a chain of custody from a recordõs issuer to a recordõs user.although the same techniques can be applied to digital records, the properties of digitalrecords compel the use of additional techniques for ensuring authenticity and integrity. digital techniques are available that can provide much stronger assurances than can existingtechniques for paper records. also, digital records are potentially more vulnerable to forgeryand tamperingñan attacker with access to the archiveõs computer could add, delete, or alterrecords in a wholesale fashion or make subtle alterations that would be difficult to detect byinspection. increased experience with personal computers has made the public aware of howeasily digital documents can be altered undetectably. the committee firmly believes thatwithin the decade, both the public and the courts will have little confidence in digital recordsthat lack the best assurances that technology can provide.digital checks have another huge advantage: an archive can verify the integrity of allrecords periodically. if errors are foundñwhether due to hardware or media failures, operatorerrors, or unauthorized changesña redundant, undamaged copy of the record can be retrieved. when this form of auditing is performed often enough, errors in the archive can befixed before they spread (e.g., before a redundant copy is created from an erroneous record).building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of

operational details. this chapter first describes basic tools andprinciples for digital record assurance and then offers some basic detailed approaches. thoseapproaches are presented as examples of the level of care that must be applied; it is notclaimed that they are the only possible approaches.digital assurance tools and principlesdigital assurances for records are based fundamentally on maintaining multiple, geographically and administratively separated copies and on using cryptographic techniques toprovide integrity checking and secure transmission of records to and from the archive. thesetechniques and their appropriate application to a longterm archive are discussed below.geographical replicationmultiple, geographically and administratively separated replication provides an essentialtechnique for protecting integrity. there are various ways to meet this requirement, involvingcomplete replicas or multiple partial replicas. a detailed design starts with reasonable goalsfor the acceptable bit loss rates and desired availability for each local site. given these reliability metrics for the local sites, one can compute the reliability of an nway replicated archive,and the total archive can be designed to achieve a specified level of reliability.at any given point in time, the engineering and design question will be how to achievethese goals in a costeffective manner with currently available storage technologies. storagetechnologies and their relative prices are evolving rapidly, so the national archives andrecords administration (nara) needs a flexible design that can evolve along with them.cryptographic techniquesas described below, cryptographic techniques provide basic tools for ensuring authenticity and integrity.1 both qualities depend on cryptographic algorithms for which forgery iscomputationally infeasible: that is, defeating the system (e.g., by altering the original recordwithout altering the digest or its signature) would require so many samples of records or somuch computing power that no attacker has the resources to succeed.integrity check using hash digeststhe technique of computing a hash digest or checksum of a record is used to check itsintegrity. a secure hash algorithm computes a compact hash digest from the digital bits thatcomprise a record. there are several algorithms in common use; federal information processing standards (fips) publication 18022 specifies four standard algorithms. the standard explains that a secure hash algorithm is one for which òit is computationally infeasible (1) to find1more details on these and other assurance techniques can be found in the following reports from the nationalresearch councilõs computer science and telecommunications board: cryptographyõs role in securing the information society (1996), computers at risk: safe computing in the information age (1991), and trust in cyberspace (1999), allpublished by national academy press,

reserved.record integrity and authenticity61a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or (2) to find two different messagesthat produce the same message digest. any change to a message will, with a very highprobability, result in a different message digest.ó3in the field of databases, òwitnessó is the technical term for a hash digest that is computedwhen a record first enters an integritymanagement system. one later verifies the integrity ofan offered record by computing a new hash digest from the offered record and comparing thatnew value with the witness.secure transmissionvarious cryptographic techniques can be used to ensure that what is received is what wassent. a digital record can be authenticated by creating a digital signature that can be verifiedby anyone using the record. if the record is altered in any way, the signature check will fail. tosign a digital object, one performs a keydriven cryptographic transformation, typically on awitness of the digital object (such as a hash digest) rather than on the object itself, to createwhat is known as an authentication tag or signature for the given digital object. to verify theorigin of a digital object, one performs an algorithm that involves a second keydriven cryptographic transformation, taking as input the authentication tag and a public key of verifiedauthenticity; the output is a binary value, òorigin verifiedó or òorigin not verified.ó the meaning of òorigin verifiedó is that the object originated with someone who possessed the privatekey. one must trust that the putative possessor of the private key has properly protected it, sothat he or she is the only one who could have created the authentication tag.it is important to recognize that digital signatures have limited value for the longtermpreservation of a chain of custody or for data integrity. their value is limited by their validitywindow: the timetocompromise of the secret signing key, the timetocompromise of thesignature algorithm, and the timetoobsolescence of the public key infrastructureñwhichever is shorter. for example, if a private key used to form digital signatures for recordsbecomes compromised as of a certain date, any records verified with the public key corresponding to that private key after that date are suspect. the case of a private key becomingcompromised after it is no longer in use is more subtle: while the compromise does notendanger records already verified, it allows the attacker to forge a document and to record itscreation date as one during which the key was still valid. discovery of the compromise of akey may come a long time after it actually occurred. compromise could also occur as a resultof a cryptoanalytic attack.4 digital signatures are, therefore, an excellent means of verifyingthat recently transmitted datañsuch as a set of records being transferred from an agency to2national institute of standards and technology (nist). 2002. federal information

reserved.62building an electronic records archive at naranarañactually came from where it is claimed that they came from, and a poor means forauthenticating the farinthepast origin of stored data.digital signatures can be used together with several other cryptographic tools to establisha secure communications channel. the secure sockets layer (ssl) protocol, first implementedin netscape browsers, later standardized by the internet engineering task force, and implemented today in all widely used web browsers, is an example of a secure channel. it establishes a secure channel on top of the insecure channel provided by the internetõs transmissioncontrol protocol (tcp) by an exchange of credentials (using digital signatures), negotiation ofshared secret keys, and then exchanges of message authentication codes (macs). the macsare essentially a sharedsecretkey signature mechanism. one important step that is sometimes overlooked in the application of ssl is that the protocol reports who is at the other endof the secure connection. for authentication to be complete, the recipient must check thatreport to see that the correspondent that it identifies is the expected one. many current webbrowsers that use ssl either omit or deemphasize this step, with the consequence that theirsupposedly secure channel may not be secure at all.longterm record assurance depends on measures other than digital signatures or securechannels. it requires (1) at record ingest, securely transmitting the data from its origin tonara and recording metadata about that assurance; and (2) from then on, maintaining theintegrity of the stored data and associated metadata while the record resides in the archive.these two steps, ingest and retention, are examined in the following sections.assurance at record ingestverification of validityagencies that create and retain records must use appropriate techniques for authenticatingthe origin of records and for maintaining their integrity while they remain in the custody ofthe agency. when a record is transferred to nara, the agency should transmit, along with therecord, metadata that exhibit an audit of the recordõs assurances using the agencyõs internaltechniques. if the agency maintained integrity checks, these should be included as part of themetadata.digital signatures may be helpful in this verification, depending on the particular circumstances. if a set of records were digitally signed and the digital signature system is still operational and the validity window (see above) is believed not to have expired, agencies canprovide additional information about record validity by checking the signatures and recording the result in metadata. on the other hand, it would be problematic for nara itself toperform this verification, because the verification depends on the operation of a system outside naraõs control. moreover, if an agency retains custody of its records for a lengthyperiod, it must face the prospect that the validity window of its digital assurances expiresbefore the records are transferred to nara.once a recordõs authenticity has been verified and the record ingested, the primary requirement from then on is to record the verification method and outcome in the metadata andto use integrity assurances to protect the integrity of both the record and the metadata whilethey are retained in the archive.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.record integrity and authenticity63assurance in transmissionas nara evolves away from transfer and storage based on the delivery of physical mediatoward networkbased transfers and online storage, the use of more robust safeguards intransferring records from agencies to nara becomes even more important. for example,verifying that an electronic file transfer via file transfer protocol (ftp) yields a file with theright number of bytes provides little assurance against either unintentional corruption ordeliberate tampering.assurances for the transmission between the electronic records archivesõs (eraõs) ingestcomponent and the originating agencyõs system are needed to provide adequate assurancethat the transmitted data come from the claimed source and thus that an unauthorized personhas not attempted to submit false records and that the records have not been altered intransmission. the best option is for nara to use a standard and wellvetted scheme ratherthan a custom scheme (which would necessarily have been subject to less scrutiny).a good example of such a standard, widely used scheme today is a properly authenticatedssl connection. records themselves can be sent securely via such a channel. alternatively, asecure channel can be used to send individual hash values for the records, and the records canbe sent any which way as long as they are checked against the hash values at naraõs end. ifstandard form 258 (òagreement to transfer records to the national archives of the unitedstatesó) becomes electronic in the future, it would also be appropriate to authenticate andsecurely transmit these forms as well.guarding against human errormultiple copies and integrity checks can protect against mechanical threats to integrity,but they do not address the biggest remaining threat to integrity: human error. to illustrate: acareful look at òagency report 493ó reveals it to be another copy of òagency report 492,óaccidentally created when someone clicked on òrevertó just before clicking on òsave as.ó sucherrors can occur within an agency before the records reach nara or during the ingestionprocess.nara ingest processes should be designed to minimize the opportunity for human errorof this sort. in addition, nara may be able to afford to have humans occasionally inspect theincoming records and query originating agencies to resolve problems. the results of suchinteractions with agencies would constitute additional metadata (e.g., òat ingest, soandsoreceived assurances from soandso that this record, and not record xxyyxx99904444, is theauthentic representation of the document with the given titleó). in other words, ingest negotiations add additional metadata. this observation is not intended to suggest that nara undertake comprehensive examination and repair of records at ingest.assurance during retentionthe starting point of a full design for the assurance of archived records is to carry out acareful, comprehensive threat assessment (see the discussion below). this section considersseveral of the obvious threats and techniques available to address them.designing digital assurances into an electronic records archive is similar to designingsecurity measures. first, the cryptographic techniques must be chosen carefully, and thebuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.64building an electronic records archive at naraarchive must be ready to change the cryptographic algorithms that it uses. for example, ifsomeone were to discover a way to create two different documents that generate the samehash digest with the current hash algorithm, the algorithm would need to be replaced. second,the overall system design, not just the cryptographic mechanisms, must not allow openings forattackers. for example, if an attacker can surreptitiously tinker with the code that nara runsto perform signature or hash code verification (to make it say òyesó when it should have saidònoó), the assurances are worthless. if such vulnerabilities are discovered, the system willrequire modification.cryptographic integrity assurancemultiple, geographically separated copies provide the fundamental basis for establishingintegrity. hash algorithms provide a performance enhancement for checking that records havenot been corrupted, whether by hardware failure, system errors, or deliberate tampering. theintegrity of a record can be verified by computing the hash digest for the bits in the record andcomparing this digest to a previously calculated and separately protected witness for the record.if the two digests match, the integrity of the record is established to a very high degree ofprobability. a witness computed for a bit stream that includes the record plus metadata representing the time at which the hash was computed provides a digital time stamp that allows oneto verify the contents of an object at the time the witness was calculated and published.although the description of integrity checking presented here has assumed that eachrecord carries a separate hash digest, this need not be the case. after all, integrity considerations apply not only to individual records but also to collections, or series, of records. a townclerk who issues 10 marriage licenses on july 12 passes 10 records to the archive, but alsoattests that these records constitute the entire collection of licenses issued on that dateñthat is,that these and only these licenses were issued on july 12. a hash can be computed for a set ofrecords in a given order. checking such a hash may require retrieving all of the records onwhich it is based and recomputing the hash, which might be timeconsuming. in exchange,however, fewer known good hashes have to be published.to protect against malevolent change by an attacker, a recordõs witness must be separatelyprotected so that an attacker who manages to gain access in order to change the record cannotalso alter the witness. since a hash digest can be written in a relatively small number of digits,one way to protect it from change is to publish it in a very public place, such as a classifiedadvertisement in a major newspaper (which will, a short time after publication, be distributed onmicrofilm to many hundreds of libraries), or by otherwise depositing the hash value in hundredsof libraries. (such a hash publication service could be provided by the government printingoffice, which currently distributes government documents to federal depository libraries.)because integrity checking requires being able to establish a relationship between a record andits published hash digest, a unique record identifier associated with each record is very useful.the published list is then simply a correspondence between record identifiers and hash digests.techniques for combining hash values can be used to reflect the integrity of a huge archiveusing a single hash digest, which is more practical to publish than a very large number ofindividual hashes. the most straightforward approach would be to compute the single hashdigest formed by hashing the hash digests of every record in the archive, but such a sequentialcomputation would be prohibitively timeconsuming. also, a toosimple combination such asconcatenating all hash values may lower the precision of the integrity check. techniques havebuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.record integrity and authenticity65been devised that require far less computation to update a single hash value when the archiveis changed and do not lower the precision of the check.5 the important property of all techniques that compute a single hash value is that the value irrefutably depends on the precisebitstring contents of every record in the archive. 6other assurance measurescryptographic protections are only a part of the solution, however. they detect damage orattack only after the fact. prevention and repair are even more crucial, and they depend oncareful procedures and system designs for handling digital records. they include the maintenance of multiple, geographically and administratively separated copies; access controls; audit logs; retention of old or deleted files to recover from unauthorized or faulty operations; andprocedural safeguards for changing the archive contents to reduce human error (e.g., requiring multiple people to authorize a change). these protection measures are important in orderto avoid or correct tampering with the archive. although cryptographic techniques can detectthat tampering has occurred, they are not able to deter or repair tampering.contingencieswhat if stored records are found to contain errors? what if one or more of the cryptographic algorithms on which digital assurances are based are shown to be easy to subvert?over the life of records in the archive, some of these events are sure to occur. thus, the archivemust be designed to anticipate corrective responses.correcting postingestion errorserrors may creep into the archive after records have been verified and ingested. this couldhappen as a result of hardware failure, operational error, a software bug, malicious attack, orsomething else. errors are detected by comparing each file in the archive with another copy orby reading the file, calculating its current hash, and comparing that hash with the separatelyprotected witness for that file. there must be an ongoing process that performs such comparisons so that errors do not accumulate unnoticed.5one such approach, first suggested by ralph merkle (1980, òprotocols for public key cryptosystems,ó pp. 122133 in proceedings of the 1980 symposium on security and privacy, ieee computer society press, los alamitos, calif.),is to build a binary tree out of the million witness values, as follows. the leaves are these values, and each internalnode is the hash of the concatenation of its two children. the root of this tree is published so that it is widelyavailable and hard to tamper with, such as in a major newspaper that is stored on microfilm in libraries across thenation. stored with each of the million witness values is the following linking information: the list of 20 siblinghash values (each one accompanied by a bit indicating whether it is the right or the left sibling) along the pathfrom the leaf up to the published hash value.6the merkletree technique was adapted for the purpose of digital timestamping by d. bayer, s. haber, andw.s. stornetta, 1993, òimproving the efficiency and reliability of digital timestamping,ó pp. 329334 in sequencesii: methods in communication, security, and computer science, r.m. capocelli, a. de santis, and u. vaccaro (eds.),springerverlag, new york, n.y., and by josh benaloh and michael de mare,

redundancy mechanisms designedinto the archive. second, the cause of the error must be investigated. failure to rigorouslyinvestigate cases of failed integrity will eventually lead to failure to protect the archive; modifying the system design in response is an essential part of iterative design.if it turns out that files have been improperly altered by the era software or its operators,it will be necessary to òundoó certain changes to the archive. repair can be facilitated bydesigning the file system to allow operations that modify files to be òundone,ó at least to somelevel; techniques similar to those used to implement òundoó in desktop wordprocessingsoftware can be applied to a file system as well. the most effective technique will be to limitthe amount of the archive that can be modified at all: ideally, most storage would be treated asòread onlyó by the software; only portions of the archive in which collections of records werebeing assembled during the ingest process would be modifiable. readonly records may, ofcourse, be subject to datatype transformations so as to combat obsolescence, but these processes should only add new forms, not delete the old forms.compromise of cryptographic algorithms over timecryptographic algorithm compromise is a distinct possibility that must be assumed tohappen at some point during the lifetime of the era. breakthroughs in mathematics,cryptanalysis, or computing power over the lifetime of the era may result in successfulattacks on the oneway functions that form the basis of digital assurances used in the archive.for example, results reported at the 24th annual international cryptology conference (held insanta barbara, calif., in 2004) indicated some weaknesses in hash functions commonly usedtoday. after the conference, nist announced that it plans to phase out the use of secure hashalgorithm (sha)1, the recommended federal standard cryptographic hash function, by 2010.in midfebruary 2005, it was announced that a team of cryptanalysts at universities in chinahad invented a new hashcollision algorithm attacking sha1 that is substantially faster thanall previously known attacks. while these results are far short of a devastating compromise ofexisting standard algorithms, they remind us that the algorithms may not be impregnable.if a cryptographic algorithm were to be compromised, hash values computed using thatalgorithm would not provide assurances of integrity. the following provisions are, therefore,essential for longterm archival preservation:¥archive systems should be designed to accommodate replacement of cryptographicfunctions and to allow records to be reprocessed to attach revised digital assurances. welldesigned security and signature systems accommodate more than one cryptographic algorithm for just this reason; such provisions are especially important owing to the very longlifetime of an archive system.¥replacement of the algorithm and recalculation of hash values should be performedboth when compromise is threatened and when morerobust hash algorithms are developedand accepted by the cryptographic community.¥better algorithms should be adopted early rather than waiting until the older algorithmsare known to have been compromised. this action would guard against the old integrityschemes being compromised, unbeknownst to nara, before the new one was applied.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.record integrity and authenticity67¥archive systems should also support multiple algorithms simultaneously. it would beprudent to use two hash functions in parallel in anticipation of future cryptanalytic advances.in addition, migration to new hash schemes would likely be performed over time, as recordsare copied from one medium or storage system to another, rather than all at once.box 5.1 describes an approach to putting a new integrity scheme in place.the issue of algorithm compromise will be an ongoing operational concern. someone mustpay enough attention to keep track of the need to apply a new integrity scheme and mustmake a judgment call about when to add the new scheme to the system. once the new schemeis added, new hash values can readily be calculated during the course of routine scans of thearchive for errors.box 5.1how to introduce a new integrity scheme into an archiveone way of introducing a new integrity scheme would require that, in addition to the hashingsystem for integrity, there would also be a secure timestamping system. suppose that an implementation of a particular timestamping system is in place, and consider the pair (r, c1), whereòc1ó is a valid timestamp certificate1 (in this implementation) for the digital record òr.ó nowsuppose that some time later an improved timestamping system is implemented and deployedñby replacing the hash function used in the original system with a new hash function, or evenperhaps after the invention of a completely new algorithm. is there any way to use the new timestamping system to buttress the guarantee of integrity supplied by the certificate c1, in the faceof potential later attacks on the old system?one could simply submit r as a request to the new timestamping system, but this would losethe connection to the original time of certification. another possibility is to submit c1 as a requestto the new timestamping system, but that would be vulnerable to the later occurrence of adevastating attack on the hash function used in the computation of c1, as follows: if an adversarycould find another record r with the same hash value as r (a hash collision), then the renewalsystem could be used to backdate r to the original time.suppose instead that the pair (r, c1) is timestamped by the new system, resulting in a newcertificate òc2,ó and that some time after this is done (i.e., at a definite later date), the originalmethod is compromised. the certificate c2 provides evidence not only that the record contents rexisted prior to the time of the new timestamp, but also that it existed at the time stated in theoriginal certificate, c1; prior to the compromise of the old implementation, the only way to createa valid timestamp certificate was by legitimate means.21whatever output a timestamping system produces in response to a timestamp request for a particularbit string, such as a signature returned by a hashandsign system.2this approach first appeared

reserved.68building an electronic records archive at naraby using standard schemes, nara can leverage the knowledge of a wide community ofcryptographers and system designers to inform its decisions over time. for example, naracan look to nist, which monitors developments in this area and issues advisories, for advice.assurance at delivery to archive userswhen it delivers an electronic record or batch of records to a customer, nara can use asecure transmission method or a digital signature, which provides assurance that the data canbe trusted because they originated at nara (which checked the origin of the data at ingestand then held the data in a trusted repository). such protections also provide assurance thatdata have not been tampered with in transit after leaving the era system.assurance for additional informationthe records themselves, in their original forms, are considered above. but additional information, such as derived forms and metadata, should also be protected with the same level ofassurance.assurance for record migration and derived formsduring its operation, the era may need to create alternative forms of the records that itingests. these alternatives may be needed to simplify meeting era usersõ needs (derivedforms, as described in the committeeõs first report), to prevent records from becoming unusable if the data type in which they are encoded becomes obsolete, or to meet the needs ofcertain users (e.g., for the redaction of classified records). in any case, the new form of therecord will not contain the same bits as those in the original, and as a result neither theauthentication nor the integrity checking associated with the original record will apply to thenew form. nevertheless, a chain of trust can be established from the original record to the newform, assured by cryptographic techniques.the basic idea is that the operation that transforms a record in order to create a new onemust certify the following: (1) the record it used as input, (2) the authority imputed to thetransformation process, and (3) the integrity of the output of the process. whether the transformation involves only computer processing or includes manual processes (e.g., redaction), thetransformation process must make such a certification. it includes an unambiguous identification of the input record (e.g., record identifier and hash digest), an unambiguous identificationof the output record (e.g., record identifier and hash digest), and perhaps other informationsuch as the identity of the person performing the redaction or the version number of thesoftware that performs a datatype conversion. the transformation process or processes arethus unambiguously identified, and the user of the record in its new form is thus presentedwith an assurance history of the document. users can then decide, based on the trust theyimpute to any transformation processes applied, whether to trust the new record.the scientific community that records, processes, and analyzes sensor data is grapplingwith similar problems. agencies and disciplines seeking to keep track of these transformationsapplied to streams of data include noaa (weather), nasa (satellite imagery), and highenergy physics (records of particle accelerator experiments). developments in these areas mayprove useful to nara in the future.building an electronic

authenticity69assurances for metadatasome metadata is an essential accompaniment to a record and must be protected accordingly. for example, the date on which a record was created may not be a part of the record, butis instead recorded as metadata. this metadata must be protected by digital assurances, just asis the rest of the record.some metadata may change over time, being revised as metadata standards change or asbetter techniques become available for extracting metadata from record contents. this information is similar to a derived form of a documentñthat is, it should be assured by an audittrail that identifies the original input record and the processes used to derive the new metadata.threat modeling and threat counteringthreat modeling is a systematic technique for enumerating threats against digital systems.it includes, among other elements, developing scenarios involving accidental or deliberatemisuse of systems that might lead to vulnerabilities. the model is then used to analyze asystem design to understand how it performs in different scenarios.after developing a threat model, designing ways to counter the expected threats, andbuilding the system, one should then observe the system to see what kinds of integrity,authenticity, and security failures occur despite carefully laid plans. next, this failure analysisis used to adjust the threat model, to design additional or better threatcountering procedures,and to upgrade the system. the process is repeated for the entire lifetime of the system.systems that are to provide fault tolerance, integrity, security, or life safety all require this kindof continual iteration throughout their entire life cycle. the buzzword is òdesign for iteration,óand this style of system design makes the feedback mechanism an essential component of thesystem design.evolution of assurance of recordsan ideal scheme for digital assurance would afford an endtoend verification of authenticity and integrity. that is, the reader of a record, many decades after its creation, would beable to directly verify the authenticity of the creator and the integrity of the recordõs preservation. as described above, current techniques are limited to piecemeal assurances that togetherbridge the validity windows of key management systems, of cryptographic algorithms, anddatatype transformations. an ideal scheme is not currently available; perhaps research canimprove on the techniques that we depend on today (see chapter 4).with present techniques, the chainofcustody and assurance bridging techniques are onlyas strong as their weakest link. an archive that superbly guarantees the integrity of its recordswill not be useful if the agencies sending records to the archive have been sloppy about anyaspect of stewardship of the records in their custody. to ensure that the era, decades hence,will be valued as a source of authentic government records, the entire chain of record custodymust use robust assurances.promoting digital assurance throughout the federal governmentthe preceding arguments clearly call for digital assurances to be applied to recordsthroughout their life, not just starting at the time they are ingested by nara. however, digitalbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.70building an electronic records archive at naraassurance techniques are not currently widespread in either government or commercial information technology (it) systems or electronic recordsmanagement systems.naraõs mission to preserve essential evidence suggests that it take a much more activerole in promoting digital authentication and integrity assurance techniques that agencies canuse to safeguard the records they create. if nara cannot provide stateoftheart attestationsabout the records it holds, the records will not be honored as valid in an environment in whichsignificantly better practices exist.a welldesigned and welloperated era itself can serve as an exhibit of òbest practicesó inthe digital retention of electronic records, including both technical and operational methodsfor assuring record authenticity and integrity. also, as new government it systems are developed and as new recordsmanagement systems are developed or procured, nara shouldassist agencies in their adoption of acceptable digital assurance measures. these techniquesrequire software to create and maintain digital signatures and the like, but also operationalmeasures to issue and manage cryptographic keys, and operational measures to ensure thatthe recordsmanagement system itself is not compromised.the records management redesign initiative, currently underway, provides an opportunity to inaugurate and promote the use of digital assurance techniques for government records.the thrust of this initiative is to engage the recordcreating agencies in the overall recordspreservation mission, taking on responsibility for defining, creating, and maintaining digitalrecords in a form that streamlines the preservation and later use of the records. strong assurance is a vital aspect of electronic records preservation that has not received adequate attention.until record creators use digital assurance methods that conform to naraõs standards,agencies that create and hold electronic records should be held to stringent chainofcustodystandards for their holdings. when records without digital assurances are transferred tonaraõs custody, nara should immediately augment these records with suitable digitalassurances, which can then be maintained throughout the recordsõ life in the era. the ultimate goal must be to achieve and maintain the best digital assurances and other recordretention practices in both the creating agencies and the archive itself.building an electronic records archive at the

committeeõs first reportas in other sectors of society, much of the businessñand thus record keepingñof thefederal government depends on digital information. documents are created, transmitted, andstored electronically. email has become an importantñand often primaryñcommunicationstechnology. and many records exist only in electronic form, stored in databases and othercomputer systems. some of these records will, in time, be transferred to the custody of thenational archives and records administration (nara) for longterm preservation.naraõs current systems for archival preservation of electronic records are limited in capability and ad hoc in nature. recognizing the growing importance of electronic records to itsmission of preserving òessential evidence,ó1 nara launched the electronic records archives(era) initiative. it sponsored work through this program at the san diego supercomputercenter (sdsc), which resulted in a series of archival preservation demonstrations. building onthis experience and that of other institutions studying digital preservation, naraõs new eraprogram office plans to begin initial procurement for a production era in 2003. as of thiswriting, nara has hired a contractor to assist with the era program and has started to definedesired capabilities and requirements for the system, including a vision statement and conceptof operations for the era.note: reprinted from national research council, 2003, building an electronic records archive at the nationalarchives and records administration: recommendations for initial

recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix b77the importance of the electronic records archives program(chapter 1)finding 1. as nara recognizes, it is critical to start developing new electronic recordspreservation capabilities quickly in order to continue to fulfill naraõs mandate to preservefederal records.with the rapid increase in federal records in digital formñand with many records borndigital or existing only in digital formñit is clear that solutions must be found for preservingthese records in order for nara to continue to fulfill its mandate. nara has determined andthe committee concurs that new capabilities for electronic record archiving are needed for narato perform its mission to preserve and provide access to federal records of enduring value.the overall challenge facing nara is substantial. the volume and diversity of digitalrecords that will be eligible for transfer from the custody of federal agencies to nara areprojected to be very large. indeed, it is reasonable to anticipate that in the nottoodistantfuture, the number of digital records is likely to exceed the number of records originating inpaper form. naraõs current systems for electronic records, designed primarily to supportpreservation of relational databases and similar highly structured records, cannot meet thesedemands.the backlog of electronic records presents additional challenges. under the paperbasedmodel, nara receives records from a few years to many decades after they were are created.the transfer of electronic records to nara has for the most part proceeded in similar fashion.thus when the era system becomes operational, nara will face a large backlog of electronicrecords that were created over the past few decades, many of which may pose challengingpreservation problems owing to their age (media deterioration, loss of documentation andother metadata, and obsolescence of data types). for records yet to be created, there may beways to avoid the technology obsolescence problem by restructuring records acquisition processes to obtain records closer to the time they are created. (discussion of this opportunity andrelated process issues is deferred to the committeeõs second report.)if nara fails to design and implement an electronic records archiving program that iscapable of handling the projected volume and diversity of electronic records, important recordsare likely to be lost for the reasons discussed above. likewise, significant delays in the eraprogram would put records at greater risk of loss. the consequence of either failure to institutea program or a significant delay in doing so would be the possibleñindeed even likelyñloss ofan important part of the nationõs history.finding 2. era systems can and should be built, but it is a challenging, leadingedge engineering undertaking, not a routine procurement.although no one has yet designed, built, or managed a production digital archives systemon the scale that nara envisions, the era program can be launched in a technically soundway. no offtheshelf overall solution is available, but there are demonstrated solutions tomany of the important system components the era will need, making it possible to startbuilding era capabilities today. the projected scale and complexity of the era program meanthat the task of designing, engineering, and evolving the system is a formidable challenge.recommendation 1. the era should comprise a series of interrelated systems that evolveover time to fulfill naraõs digital preservation needs.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.78building an electronic records archive at narathe scope of the era in terms of time and function demands that the digital archives bethought of as a set of systems that evolve over time. digital materials (records and associatedmetadata) will need to be preserved for a very long timeñlonger than the lifetime of anyphysical device or software component that is part of the era. this means that hardware andsoftware will have to be replaced or modernized many times without disrupting the archive.because requirements for naraõs digital archives will change over time, the era systemsmust be designed to evolve gracefully. for example, new data types (or òfile formatsó2) willemerge and require modifications to parts of the system. likewise, storage and other implementation technologies will evolve, necessitating the replacement or upgrading of parts ofsystems without disrupting the operation of the era as a whole. the volume of records to bestored will continue to increase, requiring a strategy for graceful scaling of storage and processing. new options for preservation will probably emerge and be incorporated into the era.user demands will also change over time, requiring modifications in the ways that records arelocated and accessed by users.commonalities with other digital preservation activities (chapter 2)finding 3. the requirements of naraõs era program have much in common with those ofother digital preservation systems.although naraõs statutory mandate to preserve federal records is unique, many organizations need to preserve digital objects and are taking steps to design and implement systemsthat address this need. they are developing architectures, techniques, experiments, pilot systems, and expertise relating to digital preservation. nara has embraced some of these developments, such as the open archival information system (oais) reference model for characterizing archival systems in terms of their ingest, storage, and access functions,3 and is aware ofactivities in organizations such as the library of congress, the national aeronautics and spaceadministration (nasa), and the online computer library center (oclc).the technology to address the era largely overlaps the technology required to build otherdigital repositories. for example, nara and others require robust longterm storage of bits,accommodation for many different data types, metadata standards and processing techniques,and flexible searching and access provisions. many systems require a high degree of scalabilityand the ability to evolve their architecture and implementation. and a number of organizations, government agencies, and businesses also face the challenge of longterm preservation oflarge volumes of data. as it examines commonalities with others working on digital preservation, nara should evaluate what is already available as commercial software.there are a few areas where nara faces requirements that are more stringent than thosetypical of other digital repositories. naraõs mandate to guarantee record authenticity is stronger than that of some but not all organizations. nara must also be ready to preserve materialsof very diverse types, even if they were created by obsolete systems or saved on obsoletestorage media; by contrast, many digital libraries can simplify their challenge by accommodating only a limited set of contemporaneous or common data types. indeed, the era will have tobe capable of ingesting the full variety of data types used to create permanent records acrossthe federal government, which will roughly correspond to the full variety of data types in usemore broadly. also, nara must sometimes redact classified or restricted documents in orderto produce versions that can be released to the public. while these and other requirements maybe special to naraõs electronic preservation systems, the list of special requirements is modestcompared with the list of requirements that the era shares with other digital preservationsystems.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix b79recommendation 2. nara should emphasize the era programõs commonality with otherdigital preservation systems and engage with other programs and organizations whereverpossible.nara would benefit from increased coordination with other federal entities (such as thelibrary of congress or nasa), other institutions (such as oclc, university libraries, archivingprojects, and foreign national libraries and archives), and businesses that share common interests in digital preservation. enhanced coordination should extend at least to increased information sharing as the various institutions move forward with digital repositories. it mightextend to such activities as joint work on standards or best practices. however, the committeeis not recommending coordinated or joint procurements, which could significantly complicateor delay the era program.it is not enough to be aware of efforts by other institutions; nara must engage them bybecoming an active participant. engagement means not only that nara will have better access to the expertise and artifacts that these efforts develop but also that it can influence theresearch, development, and deployment agendas of these groups when it is appropriate andhelp build a larger community addressing engineering issues related to digital preservation.naraõs longterm objective should be to increase the commonalities between its preservation systems and those of other digital repositories such as libraries, because this will (1) makeit possible to share software and metadata standards with other institutions, (2) help stimulatethe development of commercial offtheshelf (cots) components by increasing the size of themarket for these components, and (3) help grow the cadre of professionals trained in digitalpreservation and build ties that would help nara recruit them to work on the era program.lessons learned from the sdsc demonstrations (chapter 3)finding 4. demonstrations conducted at the san diego supercomputer center (sdsc) fornara have provided a useful opportunity for nara to explore relevant technologies. however, the work has not informed many significant aspects of the era design, has not reducedthe engineering risk of the program, and has not enhanced naraõs operational capabilitiesfor running era systems.the sdsc proofofconcept demonstration projects have provided nara with the opportunity to interact with the information technology (it) community and to explore approachesfor a production digital archiving system. the sdsc projects have demonstrated options forparts of a production digital archiving system, but nara should not interpret these projects assolutions to digital archiving issues, as a substitute for gaining experience with operationalpilots, or as a source of components of a production system. the areas where the sdsc workfalls short of what would be accomplished through operational pilots include the following:¥scale. the quantity of records tested in the sdsc demonstrations is small compared withthe quantity of records that nara anticipates ingesting.¥complexity. the demonstrations addressed only a few relatively simple record types(such as email and senate legislative records), so the experience is not easily transferable tomore complex problems.¥attention to trustworthiness issues. for example, the sdsc work did not address requirements related to redundancy, integrity checks, or access controls.¥attention to operational matters. the sdsc work should be understood as a demonstration of technology rather than as a prototype of an operational system or an operational pilot.the sdsc demonstrations shed little light on the operational issues, such as the work flowbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.80building an electronic records archive at naraassociated with ingesting high volumes of varied records, that nara will need to address inorder to run era systems. nor does this exploratory work substitute for having nara staffwork with a system in a production environment; users of sdscõs scientific data managementsystems, unlike the potential users of the era, are generally very savvy about technical matters and can turn to a highly proficient support staff.finally, the sdsc work emphasized a particular strategy for digital preservation: migrating records to xmlbased formats. although xml has important applications in archiving, theuse of an xml document format does not solve the problem of format obsolescence, and itwould be inappropriate to rely on a migration strategy alone for longterm preservation (seerecommendation 4 below). in addition, some aspects of the sdsc demonstrations were research work that attempted to express semantic constraints within records. this is a worthwhile longterm goal that may have some utility as a technique for ingesting or preservingcertain types of records. however, this particular demonstration of òlifting knowledgeó from adocument is not persuasive; the technology is far from ready for inclusion in a productionsystem.engineering the era (chapters 4 and 5)finding 5. the broad principles and expectations that nara has established thus far for theera are an insufficient basis for proceeding with its design, procurement, and operation.nara has thus far expressed the requirements and objectives for the era in very highlevel terms. some of these objectives stem directly from its statutory mandate, e.g., òpreserveand provide access to any kind of electronic record.ó4 it has also embraced the oais referencemodel to describe the highlevel structure of the system.more preliminary work is required in setting expectations for the system and estimating itssize and scope before nara can start procuring a workable production system. this includes(1) characterizing the electronic records that the era should be expected to ingest in the nearterm and (2) making pragmatic engineering decisions and defining realistic requirements andpriorities. only by jointly considering archival and technical concerns can nara chart a courseto meet its preservation mandate with achievable it systems.recommendation 3. before proceeding with design and procurement of the era, narashould gather more data about the electronic records that it expects to preserve in the nearfuture.to formulate some of the quantitative and qualitative requirements of the era, naraneeds more information about the population of government records that it will hold andprojections about how the records will be used. to guide the engineering of the era, andespecially of its early versions, nara should obtain or estimate these data now. none of theseattributes will remain unchanged over the life of the system, but it is nonetheless important todevelop the system based on these initial requirements.when data are not available or are impractical to obtain, estimates should be prepared,justified, and made explicit; otherwise, a system design will reflect implicit estimates, whichmay be dangerously wrong. importantly, the intent of this recommendation is not that theera program should be significantly delayed to conduct detailed surveys; only rough estimates are needed, and orderofmagnitude estimates will suffice in most cases.examples of the required data include these:building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix b81¥characterization of the population of digital records that will need to be preserved.how many government records, using what data types, will require preservation? how manyrecords does nara expect to receive in each future year? as remarked below, the era willneed to prioritize handling of records based on archival and technical considerations. bothcurrent data and forward estimates are required in order to make these decisions.¥estimates of size and scaling trajectory. how much data will be stored in the era, andhow will it grow over time? these estimates, which are needed to inform the technical structure of the system, may follow directly from estimates of the record population but may also begoverned by the overall project plan, ingest rates, and other considerations.¥mechanisms for delivering records to nara. while todayõs and future records can bedelivered to nara using secure networking techniques, records generated over the past 30years or less may reside outside networkconnected systems on media that are rapidly becoming obsolete. how many records are stored on which media?¥estimates of access rates. since the era does not yet exist, access rates can only be estimated, perhaps based on experience with digital libraries (which might provide a better indication ofuser interest in online collections than would data on access to naraõs nonelectronic records).the system will certainly need to be designed to increase access performance as demand increases, but even an initial system will require some estimate of access rates.¥budget estimates. the quantitative estimates lead to estimates of costs for developing,procuring, and operating the era and are critical to making informed design decisions andinvestment tradeoffs. if, for example, it turns out that the originally planned scope of the erawould be unaffordable, criteria for preservation scheduling may have to be adjusted. manydesign decisions concerning ingest processes and the amount of automation required for themwill be driven by the cost of ingesting records of different types. the committee could not findmuch basis to support estimates for the cost of the era, nor could it determine whether current era plans are consistent with budgetary constraints.recommendation 4. nara should address key design issues before commencing implementation and apply a pragmatic engineering approach to the eraõs development and evolution.although it may be tempting to speak in absolutes (e.g., òevery important record will bepreserved foreveró) when designing a system, engineering practice recognizes that there areobjectives that are subject to constraints. engineering the era will require specifying the objectives and constraints of such a system.this report describes and the section below summarizes some of the important designissues that need to be addressed and provides some advice on how to think about them. insome cases, the committeeõs preliminary analysis led to design suggestions, but this is nosubstitute for comprehensive analysis by nara. key engineering tasks include these:1.prioritize the functions of the era and focus initial design on capabilities that permit rapiddeployment of operational pilots. naraõs most basic requirement is to save bits for a hundredyears or more. to achieve this requires a combination of careful technical and operationaldesign based on extensive industry experience with robust storage systems of shorter life.examples of measures to meet this goal are (1) redundant storage of bits at separate physicalsites to survive physical destruction, (2) copying bits to new physical storage devices as existing devices age, (3) using storage systems with nonproprietary interfaces to prevent lockin byany specific vendor, (4) careful system design and operation to guard against human error thatmight delete vital bits, and (5) diverse system implementations to guard against software errors that could lose data.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.82building an electronic records archive at naraone way to gain experience is to build an effective bit storage capability that supports pilotprograms to begin preserving records in the short term and that provides a critical foundationfor future systems with broader capabilities.some basic ingest (i.e., intake of records and associated metadata) and access mechanismsare required in early era versions, but other functions that are less important can be deferredfor later implementation, as long as the initial architecture, design concept, and implementation strategy are sufficiently flexible and evolvable and sufficient attention has been devoted tooverall robustness, survivability, maintainability, and compatibility with critical longterm requirements.2.design for common cases. given resource limitations, it is not reasonable to expect a system to preserve and provide equally good support for all records. a relatively small number ofdata types will likely support the majority of records that federal agencies are creating. it isalso advisable that early system builds concentrate on a relatively small number of types. itwill be necessary, therefore, to make some choices about what quality of service to provide fordifferent types of record. to decide on the service level accorded each class of record, narawill need to assess both technical and archival aspects of records. for some lowerpriorityformats, era support should, at least initially, be limited to capturing, storing, and providingaccess to the original bits and essential metadata.3.take pragmatic steps now to facilitate future access to records. nara does not have to anticipateñor invest inñall the higherlevel services that future users might want. indeed, futurearchivists and researchers will be skilled in computing and thus will be more able to manipulate and interpret digital records. also, many institutions, including nara, share an interest inbuilding an infrastructure of tools that support conversion, migration, and emulation; thesewill be available to nara and its users.the era should be designed so that certain fundamental information about a record issaved to enable future access. this pragmatic strategy includes the following elements:¥be neutral with respect to migration, emulation, or other approaches. none of todayõs approachesñsuch as migration or emulationñfor dealing with data type obsolescence have beenperfected, nor has one emerged as accepted archival practice. today, one should rely foremoston saving the original bitsñeven if one is unable to decode or render those bits when therecords are ingestedñtogether with additional information that facilitates their interpretation(preferred derived forms and essential metadata; see below). the viability of whatever strategies are used in the future will depend on the availability of the original bits.¥save records in òpreferred derived formsó in addition to the original bits. the derived formssimplify access to records because the formats are chosen pragmatically to be common, welldocumented, and expected to last a long time. these derived forms can readily be created formany common record types by making use of existing export functions or conversion software.derived forms are, however, no substitute for preserving and providing access to the originalbits. (a related strategy that may be discussed in the committeeõs second report is to encourageagencies to create records in preferred formats at the outset.)¥do not rely primarily on a strategy of converting records to platform and vendorindependent archiving formats in an attempt to avoid obsolescence. this point follows from the previoustwo elements but is stated explicitly because it runs directly counter to the approach of converting all records to technologyindependent formats, which is not likely to be effective. xmlformats are often proposed for this role, but they cannot assume the role of the original datatype because they cannot be relied on to faithfully encode all of the elements of all data types.by contrast, an xml derived form may be a very useful derived form that serves as an adjunctto saving the original data type.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix b83¥save essential metadata. while it is often advisable to save as much metadata as possible, the most important metadata to save are those that cannot be derived from the record itselfand thus would otherwise be lost (e.g., contextual metadata).¥save essential external references that are implicit or explicit in the record. digital files oftenrefer to other digital objects, such as embedded images, tables generated by running someprogram, and files belonging to other organizations. the possibilities for crossreference indigital files are far richer than in paper files, and rules will have to be developed to decidewhich crossreferences should be preserved by copy, by reference, or both.¥archive as much information as possible about the software and work flow processes used toingest the original records. this information may be essential when future users of the archivewish to understand in detail how records have been processed. a desirable goal would be thatthe ingest process work flow be logbased and otherwise designed to facilitate analysis in casethe preserved form of the record is later discovered to have been incorrectly ingested.4.safeguard the bits. the risks of the various possible causes of data lossñsuch as maliciousacts, natural disasters, software bugs, human error, and hardware failuresñshould be assessedand used to make informed engineering costbenefit tradeoffs. a combination of appropriatesystem design and operational policies and procedures will be required. measures to considerinclude redundancy (e.g., geographically distributed replicas), media refresh (copying data tonew media before old media fail due to age), integrity checks (e.g., to verify the integrity ofrecords received from agencies, to detect errors in data storage systems, and to protect againsttampering), access controls (e.g., to control who can write or modify records and to protectclassified or otherwise nonpublic records), and auditing. some records may be deemed moreimportant than others and will justify greater investment than others to ensure that they persist.5.select the appropriate storage media. the economics, performance, and robustness of alldisk storage systems have recently begun to exceed those of systems that include magnetictape either as a primary storage medium or as a backup. while not yet common practice, it islikely that robust diskonly storage systems will become an attractive alternative to tape storage early in the life of the era. nara should seriously consider such designs for the first erasystems; they are much simpler than storage involving both tape and disk. offline, possiblywriteonce, storage may continue to play some useful role in storing infrequently accessedrecords; the cost, complexity, performance, and reliability tradeoffs associated with each technology option should be carefully considered. even if the era does not initially eschew tape, itshould be designed to make it easy to switch away from tape in the future.6.decide where to invest in access capabilities. historically, the primary tool for finding physical (paper) records of interest has been the finding aid; finding aids, along with other surrogate records, are now used by computer systems that help people to find physical records.when the entire contents of digital records are available for computer processing, contentbased retrieval techniques like fulltext searching (which has proven to be a highpayoff, relatively lowcost method in other contexts) become possible. these will alter access interfacedesigns, ingest, processing, access strategies, cost tradeoffs, and even approaches to handlingconfidential or classified records.7.plan for consistent access to digital and physical records. over time, it should become possible to use single, consistent access tools to search all the records in the custody of nara, bethey physical or digital. indeed, over time, some current physical records may even be transferred to digital form. the era design needs to take this into account, and while such crosscollection capabilities would probably not be implemented in early iterations of the era, it isessential that the architecture recognize this longterm convergence.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.84building an electronic records archive at narainformation technology expertise (chapter 6)finding 6. greater information technology (it) expertise is needed if nara is to successfully design, acquire, and operate era systems.insufficient technical expertise at nara is a major obstacle to successful development andacquisition of the era. based on briefings and other interactions with nara staff, the committee concludes that while there is recognition of the importance of the era program, fewnara staff members have experience with or fully understand the complexity of building andmanaging a program as challenging as the era. nara today does not appear to have sufficient technical depth to assure success in launching the era programñthat is, to define andmanage the overall architecture, develop the appropriate request for proposals, evaluate technical responses, negotiate changes in the architecture with vendors, and manage the implementation of the system.in addition to needing a quick rampup in the it expertise necessary to oversee the earlyphases of procurement, nara faces a longerterm need for a more pervasive culture changeñit skills related to preservation will need to be a core competence throughout the organization,on a par with its other institutional strengths. nara recognizes the existence of this issue in itsappointment of a change manager associated with the era program, but the difficulty inachieving this shift cannot be overestimated. it will not be possible to achieve the neededchanges quickly; this pervasive change should be addressed in parallel with other facets ofera development.recommendation 5. in order to pursue technical development of the era, nara shouldfirst hire a small team of firstrate information technologists with systems design expertise.the addition of a few employees with properly focused systems design expertise wouldgreatly increase the likelihood that the era program will be successful.preparing the architectural design of the era requires firstclass talent having both archival and it expertise. whether the architecture is defined by nara staff (the preferred approach; see recommendation 7) or contractors, the challenges of hiring qualified it people arealmost identical for these two approaches. if it is to be successful, the contracting approachrequires naraõs expertise to equal that of the design contractors in order to determine whether a design will meet naraõs needs.contracting for system implementation once an architecture is defined likewise requires ata minimum an inhouse contract monitoring staff (e.g., the contracting officerõs technical representative) with it expertise at least as good as that of the contractorõs people. this expertisewill be essential, in particular if nara is to successfully pursue an iterative developmentapproach (recommendation 7).recommendation 6. to supplement its inhouse expertise, nara should recruit an advisorygroup of government, academic, and commercial experts with deep knowledge of digitalpreservation and it system design.a standing era advisory committee focused on digital preservation issues would providean ongoing way to supplement naraõs it capabilities. by drawing expertise from the range ofdigital preservation efforts under way in government, industry, and elsewhere, the advisorycommittee would allow nara to learn from those efforts and to foster collaboration (e.g., ontechniques, standards, or common components) were warranted.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix b85strategy for evolving and acquiring the era (chapter 7)finding 7. building the era as a conventional procurement is unlikely to succeed owing tothe difficulty of accurately anticipating all system requirements. instead, an iterative approach is needed.procurement of the era is fundamentally different from procurement of a payroll or othercommonplace it system. no one has built an era before, and its requirements are not yetcompletely understood. also, some of the requirementsñsuch as safeguarding bits with veryhigh confidenceñare stringent. as a result, the procurement should emphasize modularity,iteration, and working with vendors to define and evolve the system rather than armslengthspecification and delivery of a completed, turnkey system.the era will need to evolve, perhaps rapidly, during its early years as technical andoperational requirements are modified by experience. later in its life, the era may evolvemore slowly as new needs are identified and as old hardware and software components arereplaced or upgraded.recommendation 7. the era should be designed as a modular system that can be built,maintained, modified, and evolved incrementally, subject to an overall architecture.a proper modular design allows components to be upgraded without disrupting the operation of the system. an overall structure for the era is suggested by the oais referencemodel, but a design for the era will need to be much more detailed in order to exploit thebenefits of modularity. a modular structure would make it easier to use cots components forthe era.the systemõs architecture ensures that the pieces fit together, that the system can be incrementally modified, and that it can evolve over time. interfaces between major parts should bespecified using an open approach that allows multiple vendors to supply components over along lifetime. the architecture is itself subject to evolution over time as requirements are betterunderstood or new requirements emerge. however, devising a good initial architecture is veryimportant as the programõs success will be sensitive to the nature of the architectural decisionsthat are made early on. it is, for example, far harder to evolve the modular structure than toevolve individual modules.the architecture of the era system(s) should be òownedó (specified and evolved overtime) by nara. this would help ensure that nara understands the implications of alternative proposals, reduces its dependence on vendors and the risk of proprietary lockin, andunderstands the limitations and strengths of systems that vendors deliver. preparing the architectural design of the era requires firstclass talent having both archival and it expertise.so too does evolving it over time to meet new requirements.a far poorer alternative to a naraowned architecture is for nara to contract for one ormore architectural designs. in this case, it may be worthwhile to obtain several proposals,because different contractors may have different opportunities or ideas for incorporating cotselements. this alternative also requires firstclass technical talent in order to specify the scopeof a design contract, to evaluate resulting designs, and to proceed with acquiring and evolvinga system.recommendation 8. nara should begin development of the era with a small number offocused pilot production systems designed to gain early experience and to converge ultimately into a smaller number of more comprehensive systems.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.86building an electronic records archive at naranara should concurrently develop and deploy small, focused systems that rapidly buildoperational experience. all of these systems should be built within a common architecturalframework (recommendation 7), so that they may eventually coalesce into a smaller numberof more comprehensive systems as experience and confidence grow. it is especially importantthat the data modelñthe data types and related metadatañconform to the architecture so thatthe digital data obtained by ingesting records into one of the early systems will carry forwardinto future evolutions.the initial systems should be selected and scoped for rapid deploymentñthis is the key togaining early experience to inform the requirements of later systems. the following are someexamples of limitedscope systems that might be considered for early pilots:¥u.s. state department diplomatic cables. nara is preparing to acquire a collection ofdiplomatic cables, which are simple structured text files, in digital form. ingest might includeautomatic extraction of metadata from the cables; access might include fulltext search or othermethods appropriate to the collection. for quickest deployment, nara might consider making these records available using software already developed for operating a digital library.¥records at the national personnel records center. there is interest in preserving large buthomogeneous collections of official military records scanned in tiff image format when theyare transfered to naraõs national personnel records center. confidentiality considerationsand the imperative to provide ready access to veterans or nextofkin would require carefulattention to access controls.¥email from the clinton administration held by the clinton presidential center. metadatacould be extracted from the email headers, fulltext search could be provided, and so on. thepresence of attachments would permit gaining experience with preserving and providing access to a broad range of relatively contemporary data types.these three examples illustrate collections that could be organized and made availablequickly. although these collections might lack the scale of the eventual era, early deploymentof systems to preserve and access them would yield important operational experience fornara and avoid costly mistakes in later, more complex systems.experience with early systems can be expected to lead to changes to the era architectureand to the substantial refinement of requirements for subsequent, more comprehensive systems. managing the initial architecture, the first system deployments, the learning from earlyoperations, and the revisions to architecture and specifications, and evolving the era will bethe task of naraõs augmented it staff.notes1.national archives and records administration (nara).

management officethe national archives and records administration8601 adelphi roadcollege park, md 20740dear dr. thibodeau:in this letter,1 the national research councilõs committee on digital archiving and thenational archives and records administration, chartered to study the electronic records archives (era) program, offers comments on the era programõs draft request for proposals(drfp)2 and the attached requirements document (rd)3 and era deployment concept (eradc)4 that were made available for public review in august 2003.the comments below elaborate on issues discussed in the committeeõs first report, buildingan electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendationsfor initial development (hereafter referred to as the committeeõs first report),5 tying the issuesspecifically to the drfp, which was not available in early 2003 when the committee completedits report. a meeting with the era team on august 14, 2003, helped the committee to betterunderstand the philosophy underlying the drfp and also informed the comments below.the committee supports the national archives and records administrationõs (naraõs)goal of building new electronic records preservation capabilities quickly to meet naraõs andthe nationõs needs to preserve federal records (committeeõs first report, findings 1 and 2, pp. 12). the committee understands that the general objective of the drfp is to spell out these needsand to seek proposals that offer thoughtful and innovative ways to meet them (thus challenging industry), rather than to prescribe too narrowly how the era must be designed.as detailed in item 1 below, the committee is especially concerned that the software development process outlined in the drfp and rd does not reflect finding 7 of the committeeõs firstreport (p. 11), òbuilding the era as a conventional procurement is unlikely to succeed owingto the difficulty of accurately anticipating all systems requirements. instead, an iterative approach is needed.óthe committee makes the following specific suggestions for how the drpf might be improved:building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.88building an electronic records archive at nara1.adopt an iterative design approach. the drfp is written assuming a classic waterfalldesign methodology in which requirements are established early and development proceeds ina serial fashion. the committeeõs first report advocated a quite different approachñspiral designñthat makes use of early prototyping and continuous refinement of requirements (finding 7, p. 11; recommendation 8, p. 12; and discussion, pp. 6770). the drfp asks vendors toprovide information on their proposed use of prototyping,6 but prototyping does not receiveas much emphasis as it should.discussion with nara indicated that the two design phases and five deployment increments described in the drfp are to be treated somewhat like iterative design: at each stage, anew set of requirements will be prepared, and parts of the system may be revised and newparts implemented for the first time. discussion also indicated that easier, less risky systemparts would be designed first and the more difficult ones delayed in the expectation that newand better approaches would emerge. this strategy will not reap the full benefits of iterativedesign, which requires learning early on from prototypes and an ability to evolve requirementsand improve subsequent designs as more is learned.for example, a number of important technical detailsñe.g., file formats supported, essential metadata tags selected, and the data model used to save ingested recordsñare likely torequire iterative development. some of these design decisions (e.g., the data model) will bemuch easier to change when the system is young and has not yet ingested a large amount ofdata. in fact, some revisions may require reading and reformatting the contents of the entirearchive.also, the mechanisms for ingesting new records are likely to require extensive iterativedesign. the degree of automation, human interface, and resulting productivity of the ingestprocess will be critical to the success of the system (committeeõs first report, p. 49). designing agood user interface is hard even when the needs and skills of users are well understood;neither is the case here. the drfp is silent on the qualifications of individuals required tooperate and maintain the era; such aspects as the human error rate will be critical to the longterm viability and cost of the system.2.specify that an explicit threat model be developed early in the eraõs life cycle. thedrfp makes occasional mention of measures that might help in averting threats (physicaldistribution of storage sites, user authentication, audit logs, etc.), but it includes no overallrequirement that the system be capable of surviving an attack or accident.7 records stored inthe era will be kept for hundreds of years and must be protected against loss due to naturaldisasters, hardware and software failures, operator errors, and potential attacks from bothinside and outside nara (committeeõs first report, recommendation 4, p. 9). the committeeõsfirst report advocated that nara develop an explicit threat model and evaluate era designsagainst the model (p. 54). retrofitting of security measures has repeatedly been demonstratedto fail. because security should be designed in from the beginning (committeeõs first report, p.53), a threat analysis should be done as early as possible in the era life cycle. moreover,contractors may propose quite different system designs depending on the threat model that isdeveloped.3.tighten up requirements related to security, integrity, survivability, reliability, androbustness. in addition to specifying that a threat analysis be done at the outset, the rd shouldbe revised to clarify a number of additional points:¥ era 1.28 should include a requirement that record transfers can be integritychecked(committeeõs first report, recommendation 4, p. 9 and p. 56). era 1.2 mentions authorization and era 13.7 mentions authentication, but these safeguards are distinct from integritychecking.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix c89¥protection should be provided against human error and malicious insiders. any request thatwould delete or permanently alter data in the archive should require confirmation by twoor more separate humans who are authorized to act on the request, a requirement that isnot in the current rd.¥era 13.4, òthe system shall support virus detection,ó and era 13.5, òthe system shall supportvirus elimination.ó how will the system handle a record that appears to include a virus? isthe virus part of the record? whose responsibility is it to deal with embedded virusesñnaraõs or the enduserõs?¥era 13.8, òthe system shall provide for backup of era.ó how does this requirement relateto the deployment strategy of òsafe storesó? is such backup in addition to safe stores, or dosafe stores meet this requirement?¥era 14.5, òthe system shall use templates to check the authenticity of transferred electronicrecords.ó this requirement is unclear, given the use of the vague term òtemplate.ó whatinformation contained in a template can be used to check authenticity? how? also, itmight be better to require simply that the authenticity of records be checked and leave it tocontractors to develop a suitable approach.¥era 18.10.2, òthe system shall output certified copies of electronic records in formats selectableby the user from available choices.ó what is a òcertified copyó? will these copies be electronicfiles òsignedó by nara? is the contractor being asked how to certify copies and how torecord such certification?¥era 21.1, òthe system shall register users.ó this requirement appears to imply that accesscannot be anonymous. is this necessary or desirable?¥rd, section 2.7.4 second paragraph. the term ònonrepudiationó is used incorrectly here(either that or the committee misunderstands the paragraph).4.explicitly require a levelsofservice approach. servicelevel differentiation is a practical necessity (committeeõs first report, p. 26). if the era must be able to accept all data typessupplied by agencies, then òidealó preservation solutions cannot practically be developed forthe full spectrum of data types expected.the committee has observed a growing recognition at nara that different record types orcontexts will require different levels of service. the drfp includes references to this approach,9but the full ramifications of servicelevel differentiation are not yet clearly expressed, and thelevelofservice approach does not appear in the requirements themselves. in the spirit of seeking industry ideas, the drfp should include an express requirement to classify records as tolevels of service, so that proposals will include mechanisms to help set, enforce, and revise theservice levels associated with records or groups of records. just as templates may be requiredto streamline the ingest of common record types, so also a codification of service levels may bean important part of the eraõs structure.era 18.5.2, òthe system shall provide the capability to electronically present electronicassets independently of the software with which they were created,ó should also be clarifiedand reconciled with the notion of providing levels of service. presumably the intent of era18.5.2 is that lack of access to the software that created a record should not preclude access tothe record itself. yet if the level of service for a particular record provides for keeping only thebitsñbecause, for example, the data type is so seldom used or so unimportant that no attempthas been made to emulate or migrate the record or do any other form of conversionñthenòpresentó must mean òdeliver the bitsó rather than òdisplay an image.ófinally, table c4, òera supported data types,ó10 should be filled in more completely toreflect (1) the data types that nara has already announced it will support, such as portabledocument format (pdf), (2) a concrete approach to requirement era 28, òthe system shallaccept all types of electronic records,ó and (3) varying levels of service and how they would bebuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.90building an electronic records archive at naraprovided for different record types. the era must be designed, at the outset, to support abroad range of record types, even if implementations of some types are deferred.5.avoid overspecification. in some places, the drfp calls for specific approaches to implementation rather than asking for proposals for an overall system that exhibits particulardesired behaviors. calling for the latter would be consistent with the strategy presented at theaugust 14, 2003, meeting, which is to challenge industry to propose innovative solutions.specific instances of the requirements specifying particular implementation approaches ratherthan inputoutput behaviors include the following:¥multiple references to òpersistent data formats.ó11 it would be best to omit these references,because whether and how to employ persistent data formats is an internal implementationdecision. instead, nara can evaluate proposed designs on the basis of how they handlethe obsolescence of data types, the degree to which they introduce errors, and so on. although the use of persistent formats may ultimately be the best strategy for at least sometypes of records, it is not the only possible approach nor necessarily the best in all circumstances.12 the requirements should be neutral with respect to how a contractor may propose designing a system that will retain the requisite level of functionality and access overtime.¥era 11.5, òthe system shall store electronic records such that an individual electronic recorddoes not span media volumes.ó this decision should be up to the implementers as long as theinputoutput requirements are met. in particular, this requirement would seem to rule outredundant array of independent disks (raid) technology and related techniques for filesystem redundancy, which are arguably applicable to the era.¥era 9.2.7.2, òthe system shall maintain an archive file directory defining the physical locationsof all electronic records within the system.ó this requirement also appears to overspecify thedesign. a requirement to be able to obtain the physical location of electronic records in theera should be made into an external (output) requirement.¥òera will support automated media maintenance and tools to recover data from failed media.ó13 does this requirement apply to ingesting records from media provided by others,or to media used within the era to store records? (see also era 11.4.) if the latter, thisrequirement would intrude on a contractorõs ability to provide the best technologies forstoring data for long periodsñchiefly, using redundancy techniques in such a way thatrecovering data from failed media is unnecessary. if the phrase òautomated media maintenanceó refers to robotic tape libraries, it, too, overconstrains the solution.¥detailed requirements on search characteristics included under era 17.5. is this detailed specification necessary? proposals should include stateoftheart searching capabilities. (seealso points 7 and 8, below.)6.strengthen the requirement for the era to preserve the original bit stream. an essential inputoutput behavior is that the era be able to ingest, preserve, and produce the originalbit stream of a record in its native format (committeeõs first report, p. 31). although the august2003 discussion indicated that this is the intent, the committee believes this requirement maynot be stated sufficiently strongly in the rd. perhaps requirement era 7.2, òthe system shallsupport retaining data files in the formats in which they were ingested,ó is intended to addressthis requirement. if so, it should be strengthened to specify that the original bit stream of eachrecord must be saved (the requirement as currently worded says only that the original formatbe used, not that the bits must remain unaltered). (of course, depending on the level of servicedeemed appropriate for a particular record or class of records, additional preservation measures might well be undertaken as specified in the recordõs preservation plan.)building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix c917.require more flexible search facilities. the rd as written assumes that there is a singlesearch mechanism for the entire archive. but different collections or record types might bemore accessible with quite different search engines or techniques. the committee recommendsthat the era be structured so that several search techniques can be accommodated, and so thatsearch software can be easily changed or replaced over time. (search technologies are discussed briefly in the committeeõs first report, pp. 5153.)8.explicitly require a federation interface that supports search and retrieval across multiple archives. researchers often search more than a single archive and will benefit from federated search and access mechanisms whereby several archives can be accessed at once. (thiscapability to search for and access items across institutions would be in addition to whateverfederation techniques are used within the era to manage storage.) if era, as the nationõsarchive of electronic records, offers a federation mechanism and invites others to join, it willinduce others to do so as well. the rd should challenge industry to design a federation interface based on approaches being developed or prototyped by others (e.g., the digital librarycommunity).9.plan for increasingly distributed operations. while the core of the era will be distributed among several sites and closely managed by nara, some processes may be deployedelsewhere. for example, it would seem essential to permit record ingest to be performed within a client agency, or by a contractor working for the agency and/or nara. over time, agencies may come to play a greater role in record ingest, and naraõs role will be to provide theingest software or specifications, and to provide careful automatic checking of the records thathave been ingested, together with associated data (data currently entered in standard form258, metadata tags, file format integrity, authenticity checks, etc.). another good example ofthe value of distributed operations is the opportunity to leverage externally supplied preservation tools, either for file migration or for onthefly presentation of an obsolete format.the era should, therefore, be designed from the outset so that certain parts can be operatedat geographically separate sites to accommodate flexible workflows. perhaps era 1.8 and era1.9 are intended to address distribution, but it is not clear. era should, for example, be designedso that nara employees or contractors physically outside a nara facility can have secureaccess to the era. this capability will enable contracting out various processing tasks and alsoallow nara employees to work from home. (note that a remote access requirement also affectsera 20; the user interface should permit operation from, say, standard pcs on the internet.)any need for other agencies or contractors to be able to examine records for sensitivecontent (era 12.4) will have an impact on workflow and other matters. is there a need torecord who (or which automated process) made a decision regarding a recordõs sensitivity?of course, a careful threat analysis (see point 2, above) with respect to distributed operations is essential, and security requirements associated with distributed operations should beincluded under era 13.10. specify more precisely the acceptable update lag between primary and òsafe storeódata repositories. the era dc correctly notes that there will be a lag while data stores synchronize.14 for system design to proceed, this lag will have to be specified more precisely: ifthe lag is on the order of seconds, large instantaneous bandwidth may be required to connectthe safe store sites in order to communicate updates, whereas if the lag can be longer, then thecommunications need only meet average ingest rates and might even use mailed media ratherthan network connections for synchronization.building an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.92building an electronic records archive at nara11.provide better definitions for key terms. despite an impressive glossary in rd appendix b, some important terms are used without clear definition in the drfp. the drfpshould introduce better definitions or cite literature in which these terms are explored further.for example:¥essential characteristicsña clear idea of what this phrase means in practice would bevaluable. for example, will the need for strong functional equivalence arise? some concrete examples might be helpful.¥persistent formatñthis term has been introduced in several papers written in conjunction with the era program, but the committee found especially helpful the clarificationoffered at the august 2003 meetingñthat is, the use of persistent formats as a form ofmigration that tries to minimize the number of transformations.¥selfdescribing formatñthis is a slippery term: every description is written in a òlanguageó that itself must be described, thus begetting an infinite recursion. again, exampleswould help to clarify a nonobvious term. see also era 11.3.¥conceptual searchñthis phrase means different things to different people. if the intent isto distinguish between controlledvocabulary (metadata) search and fulltext search, itwould be sufficient to say simply òfulltext search.ó if something more elaborate is meant,the requirement is asking for a capability beyond the state of the art.¥templateñthe term is defined in operational terms, but not clearly with respect to itscontents or (detailed) role.¥electronicallyñthis term is used in an unnatural way in several places in the rd. forexample, era 14.2 says, òthe system shall provide the capability to accept transfers electronically.ó why not simply say òvia a network connectionó? or is the term òelectronicallyó meant to include disk and tape, too? similarly, era 18.1 says, òthe system shall becapable of electronically presenting all electronic record types.ó should the wording beòdelivering via a network connectionó instead of òelectronically presentingó? for somerecords, the level of service may be limited to delivering the original bit stream. in eachcase, a more explicit definition would help.sincerely,robert f. sproull, chaircommittee on digital archiving and the national archives and records administrationbuilding an electronic records archive at the national archives and records administration: recommendations for a longterm strategycopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix c93notes1.support for this project was provided by the national archives and records administration undercontract no. nama02c0012. any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed inthis letter are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the organization thatprovided support for the project.this letter report has been reviewed in draft form by individuals chosen for their diverse perspectivesand technical expertise, in accordance with procedures approved by the national research councilõsreport review committee. the purpose of this independent review is to provide candid and criticalcomments that will assist the institution in making its published report as sound as possible and to ensurethat the report meets institutional standards for objectivity, evidence, and responsiveness to the studycharge. the review comments and draft manuscript remain confidential to protect the integrity of thedeliberative process. we wish to thank the following individuals for their review of the report: william y.arms, cornell university;
