national research council (nrc) appointed an expert committee to review the u.s. navy cyber defense capabilities. the department of the navy has determined that the final report prepared by the committee is classified in its entirety under executive order 13526 and therefore cannot be made available to the public. this abbreviated report provides background information on the full report and the committee that prepared it. copies of the report will be made available to authorized individuals in the  (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/deps/nsb/index.htm). other requests for the report

national academy of sciences, the national academy of engineering, and the institute of medicine. the members of the committee responsible for the report were chosen for their special competences and with regard for appropriate balance. the study was supported by a contracting arrangement (ref. n0001410g05890009) between the national academy of sciences and the department of the navy.  a review of

u.s. national security needs, stated the following: the united states has come to depend on cyberspace to communicate in new ways, to make and store wealth, to deliver essential services, and to perform national security functions.  the importance of cyberspace to the american way of life  and to  makes cyberspace an attractive target for those seeking to challenge our security and economic order. cyberspace will continue to feature increasing opportunities but also constant conflict and competition  with vulnerabilities continually being created with changes in hardware, software, network configurations, and patterns of human use.  cyber threats come from a diverse range of countries, organizations, and individuals whose activities are posing increasingly significant risks to u.s. national interests. some threats seek to  and longterm military effectiveness by gaining unauthorized access to department of defense and industry networks and infrastructure on a routine basis.  further, potential adversaries are actively probing critical infrastructure throughout the united states and in partner countries, which could inflict significant damage to the global economy and create or exacerbate instability in the security environment.1  the qdr builds on the former secretary of defense (secdef) strategic guidance provided to dod in 2012 which noted among the primary missions of the u.s. armed forces was the ability to operate effectively in cyberspace and space. specifically, the former , sustaining u.s. global leadership: priorities for 21st century defense,

order to conduct operations successfully and defend its capabilities against all warfighting domains, many have warned dod of the severity of the cyber threat and called for greater attention to defending against potential cyber attacks. for several years, many within and outside dod have called for even greater attention to addressing threats to cyberspace. for example, a 2013 defense science board (dsb) task force examined the resiliency of dod systems to cyber attack and stated the following upfront in its report: systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and wellresourced opponent utilizing cyber capabilities in combination with all of their military and intelligence capabilities (a "full spectrum" adversary). while this is also true for others (e.g., allies, rivals, and public/private networks), this task force strongly believes the dod needs to take the lead and build an effective response to measurably increase confidence in the it systems we depend on (public and private) and at the same time decrease a wouldbe attacker's confidence in the effectiveness of their capabilities to compromise dod systems. we have recommended an approach to do so, and we 4  outside of dod and specifically in a report focused on u.s. naval forces, a 2010 national research council (nrc) report entitled information assurance for networkcentric naval forces,

views these organizational changes as positive steps, much work remains across the navy in order to improve its cyber defense posture. along these lines, the current cno requested that the nsb through

studies conducted within and outside the u.s. government, the specific terms of reference for the study charge) were as follows: (1) review u.s. navy information technology modernization plans and processes with respect to the evolving threat and robustness to cyber attack, and identify any shortcomings;  (2) recommend any immediate operational and technical mitigation strategies needed to address any shortcomings identified above, as well as recommend any future mitigation strategies, including any architectural and procedural changes that would lead to more resilient naval systems and more robust network and communications capabilities given the evolving threat; (3) review and assess the adequacy of current department of the navy policies, strategies, approaches, and investments in comparison to the findings and recommendations to both (1) and (2) above; and (4) identify any other critical issuenot addressed in this studythat the u.s. navy should consider addressing in
