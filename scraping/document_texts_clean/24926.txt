trend with a sense of urgency. recommendation 2: a range of actions should be considered as part of a comprehensive institutional strategy, from targeted controls on enrollments or resource additions to meet demand, to more extensive institutional changes that extend beyond the computer science department. recommendation 2.1: institutions experiencing a computer science enrollment surge should seriously consider an increase in resources to address the rising workload on faculty and staff in computer science and related departments, and the limitations arising from inadequate facilities.recommendation 2.2: some institutions may view the imposition of limits on enrollment in computer science and related courses as desirable or unavoidable. however, before imposing limits on

of doing so should for the entire university community.recommendation 2.3: institutional leadership should engage directly with computer science departments or programs to develop appropriate faculty hiring and faculty size targets, and develop strategies to improve faculty retention. increasing the number and enhancing the role of academicrank teaching faculty should be given serious consideration.recommendation 2.4: larger institutionsšin particular, research universitiesšshould reevaluate the organizational placement of the computer science department and other departmental units with a computational mission. recommendation 2.5: institutions should pursue innovative strategies for using technology to deliver highquality instruction at scale to large numbers of students, and pursue additional, creative strategies for meeting demand for quality computer science courses and skills development among the entire student body. recommendation 3: institutions should take deliberate actions to support diversity in their computer science and related programs. in particular: recommendation 3.1: institutions should assess how computer science enrollment growthšand any actions or strategies for responding to itšaffects the diversity of their student bodies, and deliberately align their actions and the culture of their programs with best practices for diversity and retention.recommendation 3.2: institutions should leverage the increasmajors and intended majors, to engage, recruit, and retain more the diversity problem proactively.recommendation 4: the national science foundation (nsf) can be especially helpful in advancing undergraduate computer science education in the context of increasing enrollments, for both majors and nonmajors. the following actions

in computer science education in times of limited departmental resources. this should include assessment of the computer science skills and knowledge needed in nonœcomputer science academic disciplines.recommendation 4.2: support research on how best to use technology in teaching large classes. such research should be multidisciplinary, spanning learning sciences, educational pedagogy for computer science, development and deployment of assessment instruments, and technology design. recommendation 4.3: support research to advance the under standing of best practices for diversity in computing, includinsti tutional practices, especially those taken or considered in times of high enrollments. this research should be multidisciplinary, with experts in both micro and macrolevel social science research,  statistics, computer science education, and diversity in stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and computing.recommendation 4.4: create an initiative to expand instructional resources in computer science, informed by an understanding of the constraints and dynamics of the supply and demand for computer science ph.d.s. this might include research support and doctoral fellowships for domestic computer science under graduates, and support for incorporating teaching into computer science doctoral programs and junior faculty research.

computing in academia, industry, and daily life underlying the increase in interest in computer science,  government agencies and states should support local, state, and national programs for computing education for the purpose of increasing exposure to computing, computational principles, information security, and data analytics throughout the k12 pipeline. recommendation 8: actions should be taken to facilitate an improved understanding of national undergraduate enrollment trends by improving the primary data available about them, and facilitating the availability of those data in a timely fashion. in particular, the following actions should be considered:recommendation 8.1: improved data sources about undergraduate enrollment should be pursued by federal and state governments in collaboration with academic institutions. to the extent possible, data should be made available in a time frame where the information can be useful for academic and government planning purposes.undergraduate computing degrees and jobs should be reexamined and updated, so that those used in national statistics are more easily brought into alignment, and map more directly to the
