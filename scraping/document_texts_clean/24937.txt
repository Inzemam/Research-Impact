2017 jodi swidzinski hezky, ph.d. d. e. shaw research 120 west 45th street, 39th floor new york, ny 10036  dear dr. hezky:  this letter describes the work and transmits the final report of the committee on proposal evaluation for allocation of supercomputing time for the study of molecular dynamics, eighth round. the committee evaluated submissions received in response to a request for proposals (rfp) for biomolecular simulation time on anton 2, a supercomputer designed and built by d. e. shaw research (desres). over the past 7 years, desres has made an anton or anton 2 system housed at the pittsburgh supercomputing center (psc) available to the noncommercial research community, based on the advice of previous national research council committees. as in prior rounds, the goal of the eighth rfp for simulation time on anton 2 is to continue to facilitate breakthrough research in the study of biomolecular systems by providing a massively parallel system specially designed for molecular dynamics simulations. the program seeks to continue to support research that addresses important and high impact questions demonstrating a clear need for anton™s special capabilities. the success of the program has led desres to make the anton 2 machine housed at psc available for approximately 15,800,000 molecular dynamic units (mdus) over the period following november 2017, and desres asked the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine to once again facilitate the allocation of time to the noncommercial community. the work of the committee to evaluate proposals for time allocations was supported by a contract between d. e. shaw research and the national academy of sciences and was performed under the auspices of the national academies™ board on life sciences. to undertake this task, the national academies convened a committee of experts to evaluate the proposals submitted in response to the rfp. the committee of 18 was chaired by dr. william goddard, ferkel professor of chemistry, materials science, and applied physics at the california institute of technology. the committee members were selected for their expertise in molecular dynamics simulations and experience in the subject areas represented in the 79 proposals that were considered. the members comprised a cross section of the biomolecular dynamics field in academia, industry, and government including both senior and junior investigators. during the application process, applicants had the opportunity to suggest experts they felt would be suitable committee members as well as provide names of experts they would not like to review their proposal. the anton 2 rfp described the three criteria against which the committee was asked to evaluate proposals:  scientific merit, including the potential to advance understanding on an important problem or question in the field; potential for breakthrough science resulting in new report of the committee on proposal evaluation for allocation of supercomputing time for the study of molecular dynamics: eighth roundcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.3discoveries and understanding; the impact that successful completion of the proposed research would have on knowledge, methods, and current barriers in the field; and a scientifically and technologically feasible project with clear, welldeveloped, and appropriate goals, objectives, and approach to the proposed studies. justification for requested time allocation, including a clear and welljustified need for time on anton 2 rather than conventional supercomputers and a clear and convincing justification that the length and number of proposed simulation runs and nodehours requested are necessary and sufficient to achieve the scientific objectives.  investigator qualifications and past accomplishments, including the appropriate experience and training to successfully conduct the proposed studies, evidence of knowledge and prior experience in molecular simulations, and past publications and demonstrated progress from previous anton allocations. proposals from investigators who had previously received an allocation of time on anton or anton 2 were required to include progress reports, which the committee drew on as supplemental material in its consideration of proposals. as explained in the rfp, staff at psc conducted an initial assessment of all proposal submissions for completeness and to determine whether they were technically feasible for simulation on anton 2. proposals that passed this screening were submitted to the committee for review. a member of the psc staff was present as an observer throughout the review committee™s discussions to address any additional questions that arose on anton™s technical capabilities or on how the computer will be made available to researchers during the period of the project. the committee was asked to identify proposals that best met the selection criteria defined above. anton 2 time allocations of 460,000 mdus was the maximum amount of time available to a proposal. principal investigators could also request a lesser time allocation. the committee was further asked to allocate at least 25% of the time to principal investigators who had not previously received an anton allocation. the judgments of the committee are based on which proposals best met the selection criteria described above and on the estimates of required simulation time provided by the applicants. the committee was permitted to consider a modified time allocation if it concluded that the proposed research required a greater or lesser number of nodehours than initially requested by an applicant. initial reviews of the proposals were provided by the 18 committee members. each proposal was assigned a minimum of two primary reviewers who were asked to evaluate the proposal based on the rfp and guidelines described above. review assignments were made so that proposals were not evaluated by reviewers from the applicant™s same institution or who had close collaborative relationships with an applicant. care was taken to ensure that no proposal was assigned a reviewer that the applicant had identified as being an inappropriate reviewer. the committee held its meeting in washington, dc, on august 11, 2017. at the meeting, the two primary reviewers were asked to summarize their reviews for the committee, which was followed by discussion of the proposed research. as described in detail above, committee members considered the scientific merit, justification of the requested time, and the qualifications of the principal investigator and key personnel. the committee considered the slate of proposals under consideration, came to a consensus on which proposals it judged best met the report of the committee on proposal evaluation for allocation of supercomputing time for the study of molecular dynamics: eighth roundcopyright

(jc) gumbart, phd, is an assistant professor of physics at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta, georgia. he obtained his bs from western illinois university in 2003 and his phd in physics from the university of illinois at urbanachampaign in 2009 under the mentorship of klaus schulten, focusing on the area of computational biophysics. after 2 years as a postdoctoral fellow at argonne national lab working with benoit roux, he started his lab at georgia tech in early 2013. his lab carries out molecular dynamics simulations aimed primarily at understanding the composition, construction, and function of the gramnegative bacterial cell envelope.  margaret johnson, phd, joined the biophysics faculty at johns hopkins university in 2013. she received her bs in applied math from columbia university and her phd in bioengineering from university of california, berkeley. she completed postdoctoral training in the laboratory of chemical physics at the national institutes of health in bethesda, maryland. her research focuses on understanding how the individual interactions between thousands of diverse components in the cell generate order and collective function at the right time and the right place. she develops theoretical and computational approaches to study the evolution and mechanics of dynamic systems of interacting and assembling proteins.  ivaylo ivanov, phd, received his phd in chemistry from the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia. in 2009 he moved to georgia state university in atlanta where he established an independent multidisciplinary research program at the interface of the computational and biological sciences. specifically, his research address topical issues in the area of dna replication and dna repair. dna replication is a major target for cancer therapies, while efficient repair antagonizes those same therapies. understanding the inner workings of the replisomeœthe complex molecular machine that accomplishes replication of chromosomal dnaœis undeniably among the great challenges in the biomedical sciences. presently, the structures of many individual components of the replisome have been solved. how these components come together to form a functioning molecular machine is still unknown. recent work in dr. ivanov™s group has focused on the function and interactions of important core replisomal proteins, e.g., dna polymerases, flap endonuclease 1 (fen1), dna ligase (lig1), and dna clamps (pcna and a related checkpoint protein, rad9hus1rad1 (911)). understanding the coordinated assembly and function of these proteins in replication is an important problem. however, no highresolution structures exist for the functional complexes, and limited information is available on the structural basis for coordination of dna replication and repair activities. such gaps in understanding are largely due to the dynamic nature of these assemblies, which challenge conventional structural approaches. to overcome this problem, dr. ivanov™s group has employed hybrid methods, combining computational modeling with experimental validation by electron microscopy (em) and small angle xray scattering (saxs). all three areas, computational modeling, em, and saxs are rapidly advancing. computational methods bridge the gap from lowresolution saxs and em techniques to highresolution models and allow determination of coordination controlling elements in biological assemblies. work has appeared in prominent journals, e.g., the journal of the american chemical society, proceedings of the national academy of sciences, angewandte chemie international edition, and nucleic acids research. findings have been highlighted in press releases and have been featured by faculty of 1000 and by the oak ridge leadership computing facility (olcf) at the oak ridge national lab. dr. ivanov™s group is also taking advantage of the petascale supercomputing facilities available through national science foundation™s xsede initiative and department of energy™s office of science. in 2010 he also led one of only 69 teams nationwide to receive an incite award (innovative and novel computational impact on theory and experiment) at the oak ridge leadership computing facility.  report of the committee on proposal evaluation for allocation of supercomputing time for the study of molecular dynamics: eighth

computational structural biology and bioinformatics, including protein structure prediction from the amino acid sequence, prediction of biomacromolecular dynamics using elastic network models, development of coarse grained models and potentials for proteins and nucleic acids, and studies of proteinprotein and proteinnucleic acid integrations. he is also interested in application of machine learning methods to various biomedical and clinical problems, and has ongoing collaboration with several experimental and clinical centers.  jianing li, phd, recieved her phd degree in chemical physics from columbia university in 2011 under the supervision of professor richard friesner. her dissertation established novel computational approaches for structurebased drug discovery. from 2011 to summer 2014, dr. li was working as a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of professor gregory voth at the university of chicago, where her research focused on multiscale modeling and simulations of membrane proteins. in august 2014, dr. li started her independent research at the university of vermont as an assistant professor in chemistry.dr.li™s current research focuses on the innovation and applications of multiscale modeling to understand complex chemical systems, aiming to elucidate critical structuremechanismfunction relationships, and to provide rational guide to help drug discovery and materials design. her research projects include studies of peptide and protein assemblies, proteinsugar interactions, as well as organic, inorganic and hybrid materials, ranging from microscopic (~angstrom, ~nanosecond) to mesoscopic scales (~millimeter, ~millisecond).  diane lynch, phd, received her bachelor™s/master™s of science in chemistry from texas a&m university in 1979/1981, respectively. after leaving texas she continued her education by pursuing a phd in chemical physics from the california institute of technology (1986) in pasadena, california, and upon graduation she was granted a directors funded postdoctoral appointment at los alamos national laboratory in new mexico. upon completion of her postdoctoral studies, she joined the chemistry department at the university of nevada, reno as a research assistant professor for 2 years. she spent the next 10 years in industry, including thinking machines corporation, mobil central research, and pharmacopeia where her role was mainly in algorithm development and computer modeling. in the early 2000™s, she joined the research group of p. reggio at kennesaw state university, kennesaw, georgia, and after that the university of north carolinaœgreensboro. her role in the reggio group has been primarily the application of molecular dynamics to the study of the cannabinoid receptors. these receptors are membrane bound proteins sensitive to their environment. therefore, this requires the simulations of the fully hydrated allatom phospholipid bilayer. as such, these simulations are compute intensive and thus the group has employed parallel architectures as well as newer hardware, such as graphics processing units (gpus), in order to obtain results in a timely fashion. christopher rowley, phd, is an assistant professor in the department of chemistry at the memorial university of newfoundland. dr. rowley™s research interests are in computational chemistry, statistical thermodynamics, medicinal chemistry, biophysical chemistry, protein folding, and multiscale modeling. his research group uses applicationdriven method development to investigate issues of irreversible enzyme inhibition, ion solvation, and environmental pollutants. dr. rowley received his phd in chemistry from the university of ottawa.  markus seeliger, phd, associate professor for pharmacological sciences and associate faculty of the laufer center for computational and physical biology at stony brook university. the research in my group circles around the questions, how can we

dr. wong has held academic and industrial positions at the university of houston, mount sinai school of medicine, sugen, inc., university of california, san diego, and the howard hughes medical institute before joining the faculty of the university of missouri, st. louis (umsl) in 2004. he is currently affiliated with the department of chemistry and biochemistry and the biochemistry and biotechnology program at umsl. he has performed molecular dynamics simulations on numerous proteins since the 1980s using various computer architectures. he was among the first group of scientists to use explicitsolvent models with periodic boundary conditions, rather than simple distancedependent dielectric functions, to simulate proteins with molecular dynamics simulations. his group has adapted molecular dynamics simulation to perform free energy calculations, feynman path integral simulations, sensitivity analysis, and energy flow studies on proteins. his laboratory also uses molecular dynamics simulation extensively to study drugbinding thermodynamics and kinetics. report of the committee on proposal evaluation for allocation of supercomputing time for the study of molecular

participating in a matter if the individual has a conflict of interest with respect to the matter. when the committee that authored this consensus study report was established, a determination of whether there was a conflict of interest with respect to any of the proposals to be reviewed by the committee was made for each committee member given the individual™s circumstances and the task being undertaken by the committee. a determination that an individual has a conflict of interest is not an assessment of that individual™s actual behavior or character or ability to act objectively despite the conflicting interest. the following members of the committee were determined to have a conflict of interest with respect to one or more of the proposals to be reviewed by the committee because of the nature of their relationship with the lead investigator or another member of the research team that submitted the proposal. these committee members were recused from any involvement in the review of the proposals with respect to which they had a conflict.  proposal number committee member(s) recused 17007p lei shi 17008p nilesh banavali 17009p giacomo fiorin 17010p lei shi 17021p giacomo
