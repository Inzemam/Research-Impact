several decades the united states has been the leader in electronic technology and computer science. now many nations are mounting research efforts that challenge our technological supremacy. as the markets for products and services grow, the competition a.ong the leading postindustrial nations grows as each nation tries to stake its claia. the united states can no longer afford to ignore the fact that aany nations will sooner or later match or even surpass our expertise in ca.puter science. we need to become better informed about their activities so that we can remain coapetitive. of course, scientists, acadeaic institutions, industrial organisations, and governaent agencies do .onitor pertinent developments individually. nevertheless, there is a need for an interdisciplinary approach to the gathering of information on computer science that would consolidate uncoordinated and often replicated efforts under one roof. in may 1980 a łproposal for a panel to survey international developments in computer scienceł was subaitted by the computer science and technology board of the national research council (nrc) to the office of naval research (onr). the panel was to make łan inventory of information available in the united states about those countries believed to be leaders in computer science and technology.ł the project was expected to take about six .onths and require a panel of 10 individuals łselected on the basis of scientific and technical excellence and an appreciation of computer science activities in other countries.ł this project, which we have called phase i, received preliainary approval in september 1980. the standing panel to survey international developaents in science was chartered to combine the talents and experience of a number of multilingual computer scientists froł industry, government, and academia. the panelists were reoo..ended by the board and approved by the chairman of the nrc. they have experience with computer science developments in many countries and markets and joined with enthusiasm and dedication to prepare this initial study. the first panel meeting was held in washington, d.c., on january 29, 1981. all panel members were present, as well as a number of visitors, including marvin denicoff and robert grafton of onr. during this meeting, the panelists agreed that only a few carefully selected geographic areas could be examined in the allotted time. they chose ix international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.five and divided the panel into five sections to study thea. the responsibilities were assigned as followsa japangeorge lindawood, horihisa suzuki, and tadao muratar western europedavid gries and robert dewarr eastern europe and the ussrtania aaochaev, albert traynhaa, valentin turchin, and robert dewarr latin americabnrique marban, who resigned fro. the panel in march 1981 because of growing business and was subsequently replaced by v. sadagopanr and people's republic of chinab.t. kung and horihisa suzuki. in phase i, the panelists were to .. ke an assessment of foreign language ca.puter science publications in terms of (1) their quality and quantity, (2) their ti .. ly availability, in the original or in bnglish, and (3) their relevance and significance. the linguistic barriers encountered ranged from almost nonexistent, to cyrillic script in eastern europe, to the formidable ideographs of the par bast. large voluaes of abstracts, articles, conference proceedings, and source periodicals were exaainedr international directories and readable data bases were consultedr even translations .. de for use within companies did not escape the panel's attention. por two months the panelists studied their respective areas, receiving occasional suggestions fro. the sponsor. docuaents were collected and distributedr a variety of conceptual approaches to infor .. tion gathering were formulatedr and a significant infor .. tional data base began to develop. the second panel meeting took place on april 2223, 1981, again in washington, d.c. progress reports were received from four of the five subca..ittees (dr. sadagopan had not yet been appointed to replace mr. marban). during the next two months, panel members continued to gather and exchange infor .. tion, data, and documentation in preparation for the third and final meeting, which was held at the national academy of sciences conference center at woods bole, massachusetts, on june 2526, 1981. b.t. kung could not attend, but he sent in a precis of his report. albert traynham (control data corporation) attended in place of tania amochaev. after giving brief status reports, the panel drafted sections of the final report, including summaries, conclusions, and recommendations for geographic areas. their individual studies were prepared with the cooperation of other panel members, who suggested relevant materials and applicable research methodologies and supplied special documentation. during july and august 1981 the panel members wrote and edited their respective contributions to this final report. throughout the project, the panel chairman, carl rammer, and the computer science and technology board's executive director, jacob p. blackburn, wrote monthly progress reports and meeting reports, which were sent to the panel members and onr. the panel is grateful to the computer science and technology board for having taken the initiative and obtaining approval for this project from the nrc and to onr for its sponsorship of this work. x international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.chapter 1 developments in japan background in computer science the japanese have come from a position of essentially no activity to second place in the world in 20 years. they now have half as many computers as the united states, and their growth rate is double that of the united states. virtually all japanese computer firms are multinational companies. in japan the computer industry is one of the strategic industries on which the japanese hope to build their future. the ministry of international trade and industry (miti) has identified the furtherance of this industry as one of the łnational projectsł to which special management attention and funds are to be devoted. a largescale commitment has already been made for this purpose, and groups of corporations have been organized to work on the project. the main organizations concerned with the computer field are as follows: ł the ministry of international trade and industry, the executive entity of which is the agency of industrial science and technology (aist) ł this agency possesses a number of laboratories1 one of them is the electrotechnical laboratory (etl), which performs outstanding computer research, coordinated with national projects. ł the ministry of posts and telecommunication (mpt), which administers nippon telephone and telegraph public corporation (ntt) as well as kokusai denshin denwa (kdd), an international communication agency. ntt has its own laboratory (electrical communication laboratories (ecl)), and kdd also has its own laboratory. ecl is quite similar in function to bell telephone laboratories (btl). the quality of r&d work being done in the computer field at ecl is roughly on a par with that at btl, although not as fundamental in approach. ł the ministry of education, science, and culture (mesc). as of 1979, 33 universities (27 national), including major schools such as tokyo university, kyoto university, osaka university, tohoku university, and tokyo institute of technology, had computer science departments, with a total student population of about 16001 23 of these universities had graduate schools where most of the basic research in computer science was being done, all sponsored by the mesc. computer centers 1 international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.2 are usually operated in conjunction with these departments. tbe largest of these centers, and perhaps the largest in the world of ita kind, is at tokyo university. this center has eight hitachi m200h central processors with all necessary peripherals in operation, serving as .. ny as 750 re.ote terainals. ł the agency of science and technology, at the level. this agency has a number of laboratories, one of thea is the institute of physical and cheaical research, where soae related research is perforaed. ł the following pri .. ry companies (those extensively engaged in the manufacture, sales, and service of ca.puting systeaa)a fujitsu, hitachi, nippon electric corporation (nbc), toshiba, mitsubishi, and oki. the following secondary coapanies (those in which the ca.puter business is a co.paratively small part of the total business)a matsushita, sony, sharp, and nippon minicoaputer. proa 1971 to 1980, the pattern infor .. tion processing systea (pips) has coamanded a lot of attention. the governaent's invest.ent of tloo aillion has underwritten a number of interconnected pips systeasa ł ł ł ł ł ł a printedcharacter recognition system (toshiba), a handwrittencharacter recognition system (fujitsu), a shadedpattern recognition system (toshiba), a color chart recognition system (mitsubishi), an object pattern recognition system (hitachi), and a voice pattern recognition system (nbc) ł although the quality of pips is somewhat in question, the prograa has developed a cadre of trained and experienced people spread throughout the japanese industry. their potential value in developing a fifthgeneration computer is significant. fujitsu fujitsu made the earliest and most important commit.ent to ca.puters. it participated in all miti projects. in addition, it built japan's first digital relay computer in 1935 and the facom 100 relay aachine in 1954, and announced the 230 series of five compatible models in 1964. in december 1972, fujitsu reached an agreement with amdahl concerning technical infor .. tion exchange, and fujitsu acquired 24 percent equity in amdahl for $6.2 aillion. in august 1974 it was announced that the amdahl 470 v/6 would be built in japan. the amdahl alliance gave creditability to fujitsu. this is the first of the three elements needed for success according to the japanese: creditability, profitability, and innovation. in june 1973, parapacom, ltd., was formed as a joint venture between fujitsu and matsushita. in 1973, fujitsu espana s.a. was international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.3 founded jointly with the credit bank of spain to import and comaunications equipment from japan to spain. in september 1973, pujitsu and hitachi for .. d nippon peripherals ltd. (npl) to perform jointly r6d, aanufacturing, and marketing. in ho¥ember 1974, pujitau and hitachi came out with a joint line called the mseriea in response to ibm's announce .. nt of the 370 syatea. they called it the 3.75 generation. the m190, announced in november 1974, was the first of the mseriea. pujitau signed an łother equipaent aanufacturerł (oem) agreement with sie .. na for ita m200, m180 ii ad, and os iv/f4 operating syatea. pujitau is now aarketing their saaller ca.putera through trw in the united states. pujitsu and amdahl have agreed that the m190 will not be marketed in burope but the m180 and the m200 will be. pujitau ia .now the sixth largest computer company in the world in teras of revenue. hitachi hitachi ia a large conglomerate company that aakes railroad locomotives, industrial cranes, and home appliances as well as computers and coaponents. hitachi first used parametron technology in its ca.puters but soon switched to transistors. in 1961, hitachi signed a technology exchange agreement with rca. in 1965, the hitac 8000 series was announced and was based on the rca spectra series, which was also compatible with the ibm 360 series. in 1966, hitachi was made the prime contractor on miti's super ca.puter. this led to the development of the hitac 8700 and 8800. many models of the mseriea have been announced since october 1971, including the m180, m170, m160 ii, and m150. in september 1975, hitachi revealed discussions with control data corporation (cdc) to market the mseriea. in march 1976, hitachi announced an oem agreement under which the american company itbl would provide as/6 central processing units (cpus). the agreement was later extended to the as/7. the agree .. nt was renewed with the national advanced systems corporation (nasco) after itbl'a demise. in september 1978, hitachi announced the m200b as the world's largest and fastest computer, at 12.8 millions of instructions per second (mips), which was about 10 percent faster than the pujitau m200 and 60 percent faster than the ibm 3033. the memory capacity ia 16 mb, using 16 k ntype metallic oxide semiconductor (nmos) chips. the cpu uses emittercoupled logic with 550 gates per chip and has 64kb buffer memories using 16 k bipolar chips. it has an optional integrated array processor. pujitsu also announced in september 1978 a aasa storage system łmediał compatible with the ibm 3850. in 19791980, hitachi aade marketing arrangements for its computer syateaa in europe with basf, olivetti, and saint gobain. in 1980, hitachi announced a disk equivalent to the ibm 3380 for delivery in 1982. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.4 nippon electric corporation nippon electric corporation (nbc) was established in 1899 as a subsidiary of western electric. today nbc is a producer for satellite business systems of the united states. it is japan's largest manufacturer of communications equipment. it produces and markets 14,000 products in 100 countries and is the world's largest producer of satellite communications, earth stations, and microwave communications systems. nbc announced a transistorized computer at the paris world exposition in 1959. the nbac 1201, which used parametron technology, was announced in 1961. until 1965, nec was japan's largest computer manufacturer. it eventually lost its lead to fujitsu and hitachi because of reduced r&d efforts in computers and increased emphasis on communications. since 1971, nec has established a joint line with toshiba. nbc is responsible for the acos 200, 300, 400, and 500, and toshiba is responsible for the acos 600, 700, 800 i and ii, and 900 i and ii. the 800 and 900 were joint developments. in september 1980, nbc announced the acos system 1000 as the world's largest. model 1 is rated at 15 mips, and model 2 at 29 mips. production is estimated at 80 units over a fiveyear period. the first shipment will be made in october 1981. toshiba in 1952, toshiba collaborated with tokyo university on a vacuum tube computer. it was installed in 1954. toshiba announced its first commercial computer, the tosbac 4200, in december 1961, and in 1964 the tosbac 3400 was announced. also in 1964 a technical agreement was signed with general electric (ge). the tosbac 5400 was based on the ge 400, and the tosbac 5600 was based on the ge 600. in 1978 came japan's first 32bit minicomputer, the tosbac series 7, model 70. mitsubishi mitsubishi was the last of the six primary companies to begin working in computers. their earliest computer was similar to the bendix g 15, a scientific machine. but after ibm announced the 1401, a commercial machine, mitsubishi ordered over 30 of them, thus indicating their interest in commercial as well as scientific computers. miti suggested holding down imports, and so in 1962 mitsubishi made an agreement with trw to use the trw 53 as a basis for a new computer called the melcom 1530. the melcom 3100 and melcom 9100 followed in 1966. in 1968, the melcom 80 super minicomputer series came out, and it has sold well in japan. after trw's withdrawal from data processing (dp), mitsubishi signed an agreement with xerox data systems. the melcom 6500 and 7700 followed. in 1971, mitsubishi and oki teamed up to produce the cosmo series. in 1975, mitsubishi teamed with fujitsu and hitachi for very large scale integration (vlsi) development. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.5 mitsubishi announced in august 1978 that in 1979 it would begin development of a line of computers that would be compatible with those of ibm. there was some delay in completion of the cosmo 900 ii, announced in december 1979. in january 1980, mitsubishi announced plans to market a plugcompatible machine (pcm) system by 1983. oki oki is the third largest communications equipment manufacturer, after nec and fujitsu. oki produced a transistorized computer in 1959. in september 1963, oki univac kaisha (ouk), ltd., was formed. the ouk series is based on the univac 90 series. oki's financial position has weakened since the oil crisis of 1973. oki electronics of america was formed in 1972, and oki data corporation in 1973. oki has similar operations in germany and brazil. nippon telephone and telegraph nippon telephone and telegraph (ntt) is the second largest phone company in the world (after att). it designs equipment to be manufactured by japanese manufacturers on license. ntt spends about 2 percent of its revenue on r&d. ntt, kdd, and tokyo university built japan's first parametron computer in 19531957. beginning in 1968, ntt developed the dendenkosha information processing system (dips). beginning in early 1971, fujitsu, hitachi, and nec cooperated in developing the dips i, which followed the experimental dips o. dips ii consisted of the models 10, 20, and 30, developed by hitachi, nec, and fujitsu, respectively. as of 1978, 26 dips i cpus had been installed. installation of dips ii machines began in 1977. a second dips ii development program began in 1978. prototypes were due in 1981. ntt has a data communications network architecture, which was developed in 1977 with hitachi and oki but is not yet in operation. japanese government efforts in 1954, when the first american computer was exported to japan, japanese companies expressed concern about future american dominance in this industry. in 1955, a budget of $2200 was established to organize a computer research committee. the committee recommended encouraging development activities, introducing foreign technology through technical assistance and licensing, and limiting imports of foreign computers. by 1961 the value of domestically produced computers in japan was $13 million, and foreign machines held 70 percent of the market. a 1966 report of the electronics industry deliberation council set the following objectives for the computer industry: international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.ł ł ł 6 independent technological excellence, increased domestic market share, and gradual rise in domestic manufacturing and in profits ł in 1971 the łlaw for extraordinary measures for specific electronic and machinery industriesł was enacted. six japanese companies were paired off to form nippon peripherals, ltd. (npl), neetoshiba information systems (ntis), and facomhitachi, and $350 million was committed to a vlsi effort for the period 19761979. support for software houses was confirmed by the government in 1978. in july 1979, the electronic computer basic software technology research association (ecstra) was established to develop the basic technology of the next generation of computers. a budget of approximately $260 million over 19801984 was established. among the trends miti sees developing in the 1980s are the following: ł increased market conflict and instability arising from energy problems and nationalism. ł a decline in u.s. hegemony and intensified multipolarity. ł a more assertive global leadership role for japan commensurate with its economic status as a łgreat power.ł ł a shift from improving imported technologies to developing indigenous ones. ł an upgrading of energy and computer technology. during this period, japan's priorities include survival under the threat posed by energy problems and trade protectionism, and stable growth of its industry. the situation today as indicated in the previous section, in the late 1960s japan adopted as a national goal the development of a strong indigenous computer industry. their accomplishments have been impressive: japanese semiconductor technology rivals that of the united states as the world's finest, and, although the japanese still admit a comparative deficiency in software, their computer systems are highly respected for performance and reliability. all this has served to heighten worldwide interest in japanese computer science and technology, but this interest has been dampened somewhat by the language barrier. not only does written japanese involve kanji ideograms as well as two (kana) alphabets of 50 characters each, the japanese language itself denotes a cultural outlook much different from our own. the language barrier is moderated somewhat by the fact that english is used extensively as a second language in japan. in the public schools, students routinely learn to read english and virtually all top japanese scholars, businessmen, and government officials are able to write and converse easily in english. this, coupled with what appears to be a japanese cultural propensity to international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.7 collect data and publish reports on all aspects of their society, means that a considerable amount of information on japanese computer science and technology is available in english. nevertheless, few u.s. computer scientists are well informed about japanese activities. about 75 percent of all japanese scientific papers and 86 percent of japanese engineering papers are published only in japanese. moreover, some of the englishlanguage publications are not widely known in the united states, and some of the available ones are rather expensive. although many top japanese computer scientists seek worldwide recognition through publication in english, many of their papers are first published in japanese and only later submitted in english to overseas journals. in addition, many firstrate japanese computer scientists are not active internationally: they choose to publish only in japanese and to participate only in intrajapan professional activities. the most respected japanese publications in computer science and technology are the transactions of the institute of electronics and communication engineers (iece) of japan (denshi tsushin gakkai ronbunshi)j joho shori gakkai and the proceedings of the information processing society of japan (ipsj). the first of these is concerned with electronics, communications, and computers; the other two are oriented more toward software and applications. for u.s. computer scientists, sections c, o, and e of the transactions of the iece are of primary interest: section c contains articles on integrated circuits' section o contains articles on computers; and section e contains articles written in english. however, other sections may contain articles of interest on audio and tv technology, solidstate physics, and robotics. both joho shori gakkai ronbunshi and the proceedings of the ipsj are published by ipsj, the former in japanese and the latter in english. although the two journals are more or less equal in scope and prestige, they do not, as a rule, contain the same papers. both joho shori gakkai ronbunshi and the transactions of the iece contain englishlanguage abstracts provided by the authors of the articles published. in addition, translations of selected papers from the latter are published in electronics and communications in japan, by scripta publishing company of silver spring, maryland. however, scripta may discontinue this activity because of financial difficulties. (the national science foundation terminated its financial support of this activity in 1970.) industrial research and development activity in japan also yields a number of technical papers of high quality. japanese industrial computer scientists often present these papers at the annual conferences of the ipsj or the semiannual conferences of the iece. the proceedings of these conferences are published in japanese. other specialized papers are presented at the monthly meetings of the various special interest groups (sigs) of the ipsj and the iece and are published in japanese in the proceedings of those sigs. japanese authors who publish in english for international audiences tend to use the proceedings and various transactions of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee), the various publications international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.8 of the association for eo.puting machinery (acm), and acta infor .. tica, all of which are published in the united states. japanese tion is also strong at the (u.s.) national computer conferences held annually and at the triennial conferences of the international federation of inforaation processing (ifip). because of the considerable japanese industrial research activity in co.puter science and technology, the publications of japanese companies and the łtrade pressł aay also contain infor .. tion of interest to the practicing ca.puter scientist. the for.er are the fujitsu science and technical journal, hitachi review, nbc research and develof!!nt, and the (ntt) review of electrical eo.aunications laboratories. the nbc publication is an bnglishlanguage newsletterr the others are published in both bnglish and japanese, the japanese edition appearing earlier and being more complete. trade press publications of interest include the co!puter white paper, published annually in japanese and bnglish by the japan inforaation processing development center (jipdbc), and the jipdbc report, published quarterly in bnglish. jipdbc was established in 1967 with the support of both the govern.ent and private industries. it is a nonprofit organization whose function is to promote research and development in co.puter applications. in addition to its publishing activities, the organization plans conferences. ninety percent of the funds come froa the governaent (as part of the profits froa bicycle race gambling), and ten percent come from private industries. on the other hand, the inforaation technology promotion agency (ipa), which was established in 1971, is a quasigovern.ent organization supported priaarily by the govern.ent. other bnglishlanguage publications include the following: japan co!puter news, a monthly newsletter from the japan electronic eo.puting company (jbcc}j japan fact book, published annually by dbmpa publications using data collected by the japan electronics industry

however, during the trip to japan by murata and kobayashi, discussed in the following section, several japanese authors stated that the time was about two years for them. japan's view op !'tjtorb development substantial insight into japan's plans for future development is to be found in the computer research plan outlined at the international conference on fifthgeneration computer systems held in tokyo during october 1981. hisashi kobayashi of the ibm research center, tadao murata of the university of illinois, and robert b.k. dewar of new york university were among those attending that conference, and their reports are given below. it is evident from·the report by kobayashi and murata that the japanese plan is innovative and ambitious. in addition to describing the plan, kobayashi and murata give an account of their visits to research laboratories and universities in japan. dewar, in his report, gives an assessment of the japanese plan. kobayashi and murata's report on the international conference on fifthgeneration computer systems pgcs conference the first international conference on fifthgeneration computer syste .. (pgcs) was held in tokyo, on october 1922, 1981. the conference was organized by jipdbc and supported by miti. there were 325 participants from 16 countries. among them, about 100 were from abroad: 45

lectures are shown in appendix a, and the written version of each lecture is found in the proceedings of the conference, which was published by jipdbc. the remaining program of the conference consisted of six invited lectures given by foreign speakers and three panel discussions. the first invited lecture was given by e.a. feigenbaum of stanford university. he characterized fifthgeneration systems as artificial intelligence (ai) machines or expert systems and stressed that the critical issues are software, not hardware, and acquisition and representation of knowledge, not logic itself. this lecture was an international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.12 interesting contrast to the following two invited lectures, which were logicorienteds łt.ogical prograa synthesisł by w. bibel of the technical university of munich (frg) and łthe scope of syabolic coaputationł by g. kahn of ihria (prance). the remaining three

two previous ones were the highperformance project (19691970) and the pattern information processing system (pips) project (19711980). these previous projects have more or less achieved their original targets, although there seem to exist differences of opinion aaong foreign observers as to whether pips was a success or not. unlike these two previous projects and the vlsi project (which were also sponsored by miti and which ended in 1980), the pgcs project seems to worry sa.e japanese industry executives because they see the project as grandiose and futuristic. the pgcs project envisions computers with features to meet the various social needs expected in the 1990s. more specifically, the fifthgeneration computerł are referred to as knowledge information processing systems (kips) possessing such features as the followings l. facilities for natural language processing, picture and image processing, and speech understanding. 2. intelligence capable of learning, associating, and inferring. 3. multilingual translation. 4. very high performance logical inference capabilities with a machine speed that is 102 to 104 tiaes faster than today's super computers. 5. capability to retrieve a knowledge base within a few seconds on main storage for 100 to 1000 gb. the project will last for 10 years, which will be divided into three stagess the initial stage of three years, the intermediate stage of four years, and the final stage of three years. they plan to complete a prototype of the fifthgeneration computer by 1990. the budget requested for 1982 is about $2.5 million, and the budget estimated for the first phase (19821984) will be $46 million. (according to some sources, including a recent article in business week (december 14, 1981, pp. 39120), the total budget for pgcs over the period of 10 years is projected as high as $400 million.) however, it should be noted that a majority of people who engage in the project are government employees whose salaries are not counted in the budget since international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.13 they are paid from the regular budget. mr. okamatsu stated in a panel discussion session that they were negotiating with the ministry of finance for additional funds. as of this writing, japan's ministry of finance has yet to approve any funding, and some committee aembers we met at the conference were concerned that the recent pressure to reduce the governaent spending might adversely affect the fgcs project. it should be noted that the fgcs program is just one of several mitisponsored projects (see appendix b). others are (1) basic technology development of the next generation (fourth generation) computerł with emphasis on software technology and peripherals' (2) r'd for highspeed scientific computers (the socalled łsuper computer projectł), and (3) the optoelectronic integrated circuit project. major computer manufacturers seem much more involved in these projects than in the pgcs, because of their nearterm impact. por instance, fujitsu, hitachi, and nbc are all working on a supercray machine that will be ready in 19831984. the ultimate target of the highspeed scientific computer project is 10 billion floating point operations (bflops) according to the information we obtained at hitachi, but this target, like that of fgcs, sounds overly ambitious. (see the section on the hitachi central research laboratory below.) as for the fgcs project, the industry executives we met at fujitsu and hitachi said that they had not figured out specifically how to participate in the program, but their intention to cooperate in the project is unquestionable. the overall organization of the fgcs project, its members, and their affiliations are shown in appendix c. also, at the end of the fgcs conference proceedings, about 100 major contributors to the preliminary studies of the project are listed. among them, the largest group of 15 researchers is from miti's btl, and one half of the fgcs lectures were delivered by people from btl. there are also contributors from japanese computer manufacturers such as fujitsu, hitachi, nbc, toshida, mitsubishi, oki, matsushita, and sharp, as well as from ntt, jipdbc, and various universities. research themes of fgcs project the technical details of the pgcs project can be found in two publications given to the attendees at the conference: the proceedings of the fgcs conference and research reports in japana collection of recent research reports related to the r'd of the fgcs (both of which were published by jipdbc), whose tables of contents are shown in appendixes a and d, respectively. in addition to these publications written in english, the fgcs committee had earlier published seven volumes of reports in japanese (2276 pages). they have made very thorough surveys of the state of the art of fgcsrelated technologies (vlsi, new programming languages, data flow machines, relational data base, natural language understanding, machine translation, speech and image recognition, and so on). many people, including us, doubt that in 10 years they can develop their dream system, which will be composed of łseeing, hearing, and speakingł computers equipped with common sense that will enable the systems to judge from memory (knowledge base) and solve new problems (inference and problemsolving capabilities). international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.14 to present an overall picture of this huge project, we will summarize below the proposed research and development theaes. the pgcs committee has proposed 26 themes on which research and development will be carried out in the next several years. the themes are grouped into the following seven areas: (1) basic application systems, (2) basic software systems, (3) new advanced architecture, (4) distributed function architecture, (5) vlsi technology, (6) systematization technology, and (7) development supporting technology. as basic application systems, they propose to develop the following six systems: (11) machine translation system, with 90 percent accuracy, (12) questionanswering system, to be used for intelligent robots, (13) applied speechunderstanding systems, such as a phonetic typewriter' (14) picture and image data storage and retrieval system, and (15) applied problemsolving system, having the ability to play the gogame at the level of amateur grade 1. as basic software systems, they propose to develop the following three systems: (21) knowledge base management system, with storage and retrieval of 20,000 rules and 108 data items (100 gb)j (22) inference machine, which performs 102 to 103 megalogical inferences per second (note that one logical inference per second (lips) corresponds to 100 to 1000 instructions per second according to their estimate)' and (23) intelligent inference system, to communicate with unspecified speakers in terminology used in one branch of science. in the area of new advanced architecture, they propose to investigate the following six machines: (31) logicprogramming machines, using prolog as a starting point1 (32) functional machine (based on lisp, reduction, and data flow function machines), suitable for symbol manipulation and list processing, (33) relational algebra machine, to support the relational data base system, using 100 parallel processors' (34) abstractdatatype support machine, to modularize the vast and complex software' (35) data flow machine, to perform parallel processing using 103 to 104 processors and 10gb memory, and with the final target performance, 10 billion instructions per second (bips)j and (36) innovative von neumann machine, using vlsi with 10 million transistors per chip. note that in the above research topics, (31), (32), (34), and (35) are all closely related. the area of distributed function architecture includes the following investigations and developments: (41) network architectures' (42) data base machine, with 1000gb capacity and 104 transactions per second performance: (43) highspeed numerical computation machine, using 1000 processor elements to achieve 1 bflops performance' and (44) highlevel manmachine communication system, to handle about 4000 chinese characters, 1000 words, and 104 x 10t dots for picture and image processing. the area of vlsi technology includes investigation of the following types: (5l) vlsi architecture, to make full use of vlsi with 10 million transistors per chip, which is expected to be available around 19901 and (52) intelligent vlsi computeraided design (cad) system, capable of storing architecture data base and design knowhow data base. the area of systematization technology includes development of the following systems: (61) intelligent programming system, which is international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.15 capable of fetching subprograms from an algorithm bank (knowledge base) by user requirements, synthesizing a program, and verifying whether it meets the specified requirements in an optimum manner by a process of inferencej and (62) data base and distributed data base systems. as a developing support system, they propose to build a hardware environment called system sg on which vlsicad systems will run. the cad systems will eventually become intelligent cad systems that will acquire design knowhow and perform automatic design of vlsi chips. system sg will consist of super inference machines and sg communication networks. system sg can be accessed through sg personal computers (very high intelligence terminals) for vlsicad and software development necessary for the fgcs project. system sg is to be used for developing the fgcs, including inference machines. but system sg needs super inference machines. this would seem to be a vicious circle, unless a łsuper inference machineł (part of the fgcs) can be built without the use of system sg. prolog versus lisp in the fgcs project łprologł and łnata flowł are the technical terms that we heard most frequently during the presentations of the fgcs project. the word prolog is short for łprogramming in logic,ł and it was originally proposed by k. kowalski at the 1974 international federation of information processing (ifip) congress. it is a highlevel programming language that seems suited to the representation and manipulation of knowledge. most of the u.s. participants (except for language specialists) had barely heard of prolog prior to the conference. lisp is more or less a standard language for people working on artificial intelligence (ai) in the united states. thus one question raised by many u.s. participants was łwhy prolog, not lisp?ł or łwhy a logic programming language, not a conventional programming language?ł koichi furukawa of btl answered this question as follows: prolog has all the features that pure lisp has, except for a lambda function. in addition, nondeterministic procedures are possible in prolog. formal treatment and verification are easier in a logic programming language such as prolog. a logic language forces us to develop wellstructured programs so that readability and modifiability should improve. however, it may be difficult to do intelligent optimizations so as to produce efficient programs on a logic programming language. on the other hand, logic expressions can contain a lot of parallelisms and thus may be suitable for data flow machines. it seems that there is a natural relation between prolog and dataflow computation. (see łprolog and dataflow computation mechanism,ł by t. yokoi of btl, in jipdec's research reports in japana collection of recent research reports related to the r'd of the fgcs.) international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.16 kazuhiro fuchi of btl stated that, łprolog is chosen as the starting point because prolog systeas are considered capable of integrating all the good features of lisp systems, and since prolog is a programming language based on basic inference operations, prolog machines could represent the first step toward inference aachines.ł according to inforaation presented at the conference, research in· prolog has been primarily pursued in europe, especially at the university of edinburgh, scotland, and at marseilles university, france. j.f. sowa of ibm systems research institute (sri) in new york city is also active in the field. a tiaely tutorial article by ron ferguson entitled łprologa step toward the ultiaate ca.puter language,ł was recently published in the byte magazine (november 1981, pp. 384399). observations and assessaents of the fgcs project as was pointed out by tohru motooka and hajime karatau in their lectures, there will be many impacts if the fgcs project is łsuccessful.ł for example, the following changes are expected: 1. computers that can be operated by natural languages will be much easier to use than today's ca.puters. this will significantly broaden application areas. therefore the number of people using computers will increase explosively. 2. such computers be helpful in enhancing productivity in the currently lowproductivity sectors such as retail industries, public services, medical services, offices of whitecollar workers, agriculture, fishery, and forestry. 3. the use of intelligent robots will spread over various manufacturing plants. 4. multilingual translation machines will reduce the language barrier of the japanese. this together with satellite ca.munication and optical fiber techniques will help internationalization of japan. s. japan has an opportunity to fulfill its international duty expected as an economic power by investing and taking a leadership role in a largescale scientific project such as the pgcs. the subject of international cooperation was brought up from time to time during the conference. for example, b.a. feigenbaum, of stanford university, said, łsignificant international collaboration will be possible and useful in the development of fifthgeneration systems. ł ł ł a truly international effort will be necessary and a major international economic and social benefit will result.ł we gather from various discussions that the following statements from the proceedings of the pgcs conference represent the pgcs committee's position: for a number of reasons, it is difficult to make this an international project. instead, it is desirable to execute it as a national project with japan having the liberty to decide international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.17 its course. it aust be noted, however, that the project includes research on aechanical translation, mechanical interpretation, etc. which must be carried out handinhand with other countries. in these fields, therefore, it will be found expedient to link the projects with similar projects abroad or arrange for joint studies. during the panel discussions, two opposite views were expressed on the pgcs project: one view was that the scope of the project is too broad and the other view was that it is too narrow. the for .. r opinion is expressed in state .. nts such as, łthe project must confront the reality and aust focus on smaller topics. we cannot work on so .any aspects. we do not have enough computer scientists. being realistic is proponents of the latter view point out that łthere are neglected areas such as ca.plexity theory, algorithm design, semantics, and biological approach.ł b.b. mccormick, of stanford university, viewed the fgcs's proposal as being aade up of three principal subprojects, the sg personal computer, sg super computer, and sg cognitive computer, and he said, in 25 years in the computer field, i have observed many super computer projects ł ł ł ł none of these projects remotely achieved its stated goalsr all the syste .. they built were not commercially successful. nonetheless, projects such as these built the early american supremacy of the computer industry łłłł i see the fgcs as a project to develop the technological base underlying knowledge systems. our observation is sa.ewhat in line with mccormick's. clearly, the goals set by the pgcs project are overly aabitious and optiaistic. as a longrange national project, however, it is necessary and appropriate to set goals so high that no single coapany can afford working alone. if a project is so conservative that success is in sight, there is no need for a national project: it can be carried out within a coapany. in the pgcs project, so.e will succeed, soł may fail. it is doubtful that they will produce ooamercially successful ai .. chines within 10 years. but that is not their purpose. the significance of the project will be the scientific byproducts, or the basic technologies that .. y result from the nationwide efforts to make the project as successful as possible. these byproducts will be helpful for improving productivity in aany fields and will strengthen japanese industry as a whole. these accomplish.nts would certainly increase japan's oo.petitive position in a nuaber of hardware and software products in future office auta.ation, personal computer, distributed systems, and so on. an accurate assessment of the fgcs project will be to view it as a part of łjapan's strategy for the łeosł as described in a recent article in business week 14, 1981). japanese scientists and engineers seea determined to prove themselves as innovators and to surpass the united states in this knowledgeintensive industry. the pgcs project together with other mitisponsored research prograas (see appendix b) will help young researchers in japan gain confidence to become more innovative in the computer field. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of

visits, which were arranged by the national research council through the orr office in tokyo. 'l"be first author had visited these institutions in 1971 and 1976 and was impressed this ti .. by the changes that have been made and the progress that our japanese colleagues have achieved since then. in 1970 and 1971, aajor universities in japan were opening new depart.ents called łinforaation engineeringł or łinforaation scienceł that were separate froa the traditional electrical and electronics engineering depart.ents. the university computer centers were primarily oriented, and there were a relatively small nuaber of terainals for tiaesharing service. the curriculua at that tiae was doainated by infor.ation sciences (such as information and coding theory, signal processing, and pattern recognition), and very few courses were given on architecture, operating systems, software, artificial intelligence, and so on. the situation has changed significantly in the past 5 to 10 years. the university curricula seem coaparable to those of many u.s. universities, although they do not aatch such aajor universities as stanford and mit in breadth of subjects offered. at tokyo, kyoto, and osaka universities, however, we found that aany laboratories were well equipped with computing facilities, ainioomputers and microco.puters. bxperiaental data flow machines have been impledmtnted in several places, and there is an increasing level of activity in sophisticated pattern recognition, speech recognition, and language translation. artificial intelligence is gaining popularity, although we did not see in japan łexpert systeaał like those developed at stanford university. we met several students working on topics related to lisp and prolog. the industrial and government laboratories we visited were miti's btl, htt's yokosuka laboratory, and the research laboratories of hitachi, pujitsu, and nbc. all these sites except for hitachi's central research laboratory are relatively new. ten years ago, btl was in a shabby building in downtown tokyo and was about to launch the pips project. row it occupies an building in a serene environaent of tsukuba city, equipped with powerful computing facilties. htt's yokosuka laboratory was established in 1972, and its .adern gigantic building is as striking as that of bell laboratories in boladel or of the ibm research center in yorktown, although it is smaller that these u.s. laboratories (it houses only 1000 eaployees). at pujitsu, hitachi, and nbc, our japanese colleagues were quite open in discussing their latest highend machines such as paoom m380/382 and hitac m280h, which is under development. all three companies are working on supercray computers, which will be ready in two to three years. hitachi is working on a vector processor called hp1 whose speed will be 250 mplops. the mitisponsored super coaputer project is substantially more aggressive and is aiming at 10 bplops. pujitsu is proud of its successful development of a new arsenide(gaas)based transistor, bbmt (high electron .ability international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.19 transistor). there are several to a dozen people working on the josephson junction in each of these laboratories as well as at btl and nft. personal computers are booming among computer hobbiests and small businesses. we heard that many short courses on personal computers are commercially available. both miti and japanese computer manufacturers are placing significant emphasis on software development. at both fujitsu and nec we heard about their efforts on software design and management tools. electrotechnical laboratory. the electrotechnical laboratory (btl) is the largest national research organization in japan specializing in electricity and electronics. since its establishment in 1891, btl has undergone a series of expansions and reorganizations to cope with the needs of rapid technological innovation. in 1948 it gave birth to the electrical communication laboratory (nippon telegraph and telephone public corporation), and the btl became a part of the agency of industrial science and technology (aist), which is under miti. btl has 729 employees, of whom 566 are research staff. it is one of the nine research organizations (of 16) that have in recent years moved to tsukuba to form the tsukuba research center of aist. tsukuba is a new scientific and educational city located approximately 60 km (37 miles) from the center of tokyo to the northeast and about 40 km northeast of the new tokyo international airport. first we visited their impressive computer center. the new research information processing system (rips), which was installed and became operational in december 1980, offers advanced computing services to the tsukuba research center of aist. it contains the following four subsystems: 1. boat computer, which is a facom m200 (11.8 mips) with 16mb main memory, 64kb buffer, and 38gb mass storage system. 2. center work stations, which provide highperformance inputoutput devices. the work stations include batch and timesharing system (tss) work stations, kanji displays (fujitsu 6652a), highperformance and highresolution graphic displays, computeraided design (cad) work stations, and so on. 3. remote work stations and laboratory automation facilities. 4. optical fiber communication network. it consists of three types of subnetworks: (a) looped data highways operating at 16.89 mbits/sj (b) starlike dedicated network with the maximum data transmission rate of 1.5 mb/sj (c) video network, which allows remote access of a video film library. more than 500 data terminals are accommodated by the data highway, and approximately 50 minicomputers are planned to join the network. the three optical communication networks have an overall length of 360 km. we then visited the information science division, which has approximately 50 people and consists of six sections: bionics, pattern processing, speech processing, mathematical engineering, computer international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.20 vision, and .. chine inference. kasuhiro puchi is the general .. nager of the infor .. tion science division. be alao serves as chair.n of the on basic theory for the pgcs project. r. hakajt.a of the pattern processing section showed us their work on synthetic speech and speech recognition, which is a continuation of the pips project that miti sponaored in the 1970s. ror speech recognition they use a vocal code .adel to be represented by 17 par ... ters. the systea can recognise 23 pboneaes and 80 to 90 syllables. their goal is to have a dictionary of 3000 to 5000 words. in the seaiconductor device section (which is in the electronic device division), b. hayashi explained their efforts to develop future elements of vlsi. as for the a..ory chip, their target is a nonvolatile aeaory chip of 10 mbits, which .. y become an alternative to the .. gnetic bubble. as for logic eleaents, they are looking into the highapeed liaits of metallic oxide seaiconductor largescale integration (moslsi). hayashi said that 10 people were working in the seaiconductor device section. in addition, five to six people are working in gaaa research, and six people on the josephson junction within btl. bosuai tanaka, who is .. nager of the machine inference section and gave a presentation on łintelligent manmachine interface mechani ... ł at the pgcs conference, described their efforts in natural language understanding. the effort is directly related to aachine translation and questionanswering syste... be said that their effort to iapleaent a syntactic parser was already five years old. a syntactic analysis parsing tree was created by using lingol of mit, and the iaple.ntation language is standardised lisp, i.e., utah's lisp. our overall impressions of btl were as follows& the building and facilities (especially the computing center), as well as the serene surroundings, were quite impressive. the levels of technical expertise of the btl people appear very high, although relatively few of thea hold ph.d.'s and they rarely publish papers in international journals. the number of researchers who are actually involved in the pgcs at btl is 20 to 25. unless they inti .. tely coordinate their basic research efforts with those at universities and industries, they will not be able to attack all the important theoretical proble.. that are required for the development of fgcs. yokosuka electrical eo .. unication laboratory of ntt. the electrical oomaunication laboratories (bcl) is the research ara of nippon telegraph and telephone public corporation (ntt) and consists of the r6d bureau, musashino bcl (1800 people), yokusuka bcl (1000 people), and ibaraki bcl (200 people). yokosuka bcl was established in 1972, and its activities include the following& ł data communication (data communication network, computer, and text processing), ł transmission (digital network, optical fiber, satellite communications, and mobile communication), ł video communication (facsimile, video conferencing, and video processing), and international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.21 ł inputoutput equipment (telephone sets and inputoutput equipment for data, character, and speech). the data communication department under iwao toda developed ntt's network architecture dcna, which resembles ibm's sna. toda was also the head of the dips project, which developed highperformance computers (dips i, dips ii model 5, dips ii model 25, and so on), software, and the data base for ntt's nationwide data communication system. in his department is a communicating word processor (cwp) that can perform functions such as drafting of documents, editing of image pattern input through a facsimile terminal, document storage, and text communication. also under study are kanakanji code conversion, japanese textediting processing, and kanjiprocessing software. research and development efforts on optical fiber communication systems are being pursued by the ecl's three laboratories: musashino is responsible for devices (optical source and detector)j ibaraki is responsible for fiber and cable, and yokosuka is drawing up a total system. in the midoctober, ntt sent out a press release concerning a semiconductor laser for a 1.5p oscillator, where 1.5 p is the wavelength with least propagation loss. as for satellite communication, they are working on the development of domestic satellite communication systems using the 30/20 gbz band and datdma (demand assignedtime division multiple access) systems. captain is ntt's viewdata, a video information service providing a textediting system that is unique to japanese markets. it is a facsimilebased text editing for handwritten documents: by adding special marks to the original documents by hand and inputting them into the facsimile terminal, a user can obtain an edited output as a facsimile output. speech recognition technology is applied to such areas as mail sorting at the post office and information and inquiry service in the banking business. as for speech synthesis, ntt bas a patent dispute with texas instruments (ti) because parcor (partical correlation technique), which was developed by dr. itakura and others of ecl is used by ti in its product łspeak and spell.ł (a number of japanese companies including hitachi, mitsubisbi, nec, sanyo, oki, general instrument, and matsushita are producing largescale integration (lsi) implementation of itakurałs voice synthesis method.) an optical character reader (ocr) terminal has been developed by which handwritten alphanumerical, łkatakana,ł and special symbols can be read accurately. recognition of kanji (printed and handwritten) is still in the research stage. a new portable kanji printer that prints at the speed of 15 characters per second has been developed, using the thermal printing method and an lsi maskrom (1 mbit) for the generation of 3400 kanji characters. the musashino ecl, which has a staff of about 1800, includes a division called the fundamental research division. dr. yamashita from its information processing research department gave us a brief account of their activities. activities include machine translation (eight people), data flow machine (nine people), data base machine (two people), lisp machine (two people), programming theory, data base international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.22 theory, and cryptography. in the machine translation group, a prototype system is under way baaed on the transfer method. it uses dbc 2020/tops using matrix language. according to yamashita, similar efforts exist at fujitsu, kyoto university (professor makoto nagao), and kyusbu university (professor tamacbi). the data flow machine group started two years ago and is building a lisp machine. they are not considering the use of prolog yet. a data flow processor array syetea, eddy, is being developed, which consists of 4 x 4 processing ele.ente (two z8001 each) and two broadcast line control units. this is used for analyzing the operational characteristics of the datadriven processor array system. as for research on data flow machines, saae efforts exist at oki, gunma university (professor sowa), as well as at btl, ecl, and the university of tokyo. the htt group has quite a few entries in research reports in japana collection of recent research reports related to the r&d of the fifthgeneration computer systems (see appendix d). dr. banada, the head of the software engineering department in the data processing development division at yokosuka ecl, described the design methodology used in dips (dips is htt's standard information processing system). a documentation chart called bcd (hierarchical and compact description chart) bas been developed by extending the bipo flow chart of ibm. it is used for developing control programs, data base software, and language processors. university of tokyo electrical engineering and electronics departments: professor hiroshi miyakawa, a wellknown information and coding theorist, gave us an overview of the electrical engineering (be) department, which has 10 chairs, and the electronics department, which has 6 chairs. each chair consists of one professor, one associate professor, and two assistants. the two departments occupy the same building (the electronics department branched out from the be department in 1960), and for all practical purposes they are not distinguishable. there are 95 juniors and 95 seniors for the two departments combined. their master's course (a twoyear program) has the capacity of 48 students per year. the doctoral course (a program of three or more additional years after the master's course) has the capacity of 28, but the actual number of enrolled ph.d. candidates is around 20 each year. about 25 to 30 percent of ph.d. graduates will find university positions, and the rest will go to industrial and government laboratories. there are a number of research projects related to data flow computation. professor minoru akiyama and mr. yamashita (a secondyear ph.d. student) discussed the application of data flow computation to the telephone exchange system. they showed us their small prototype implementation called dataflex1. the hardware of the control section of dataflex1 is similar to łbasic dfmł of mit. zilog 80a and intel 8086 are used as processor elements. associate professor tadao saito, who is under professor hiroshi inose (currently at caltech as a visiting professor), gave us a international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.23 presentation on three topicsz (1) oo.puter (packet switching, protocol validation, and protocol atandardization)j (2) oo.puter architecture (data flow .. chine)j and (3) online library ayatea. the last subject is sponsored by the ministry of education, and inoae is chair .. n of the oo.mittee of this project, called the łscientific infor .. tion center project.ł it will connect 10 to 15 libraries (primarily science and literature) under the ministry of education using the łn1 network,ł which is a network that connects .. jor national universities. the network protocol is similar to that of advanced research projects agency network (arpanet) (unlike ayateaa network analysis (sna)) in the sense that it has distributed control. optical laser disks (10,000 pages per disk) will be used as a data base, and the system will become operational in three years. the data flow .. chine project of the inoaesaito laboratory started four years ago, and it is called the distributed data driven oo.puter (d3c). they use lst 11/2 as processing units and arbitration network. saito says the arbitration network is a bottleneck of the architecture. three graduate students are working on the implementation, and their objective is to achieve a data flow of 100 mbita/a. profeaaor tohru motooka and associate profeaaor ridehiko tanaka specialize primarily in computer architectures. motooka is the chairman of the pgcs organizing committee, and tanaka is alao a key aeaber and gave a presentation on łpreliminary research on data flow machines and data base machines as the basic architecture of generation coaputer syate .. ł at the conference. we saw a prototype impl ... ntation of a procedure level data flow .. chine called topstar. the systea hardware is co.poaed of two kinds of aoduleaz pm (processing aodule) and cm module). pm and cm correspond to a łtransitionł and a łplaceł in a petri net, respectively, and they are both constructed with a z80 aicroproceaaor, 16ib ..ory, and peripheral lsia such as interrupt controller (i 8259) and dma controller (i 8257). in their current version, topstarii, there are 16 pm8 and 8 cma. bach pm is connected to several (ranging from 5 to 8) cma. they are currently working on several applications of this data flow machine, such as parallel mergesort, simulation of logic circuits, and fault simulation. motooka and tanaka have also developed a multimodule associative processor called dreamii. it is a specialpurpose processor for pattern processing, which is connected to the host caaputer through a dma channel. dreamii is a single instruction multiple data (simd) type processing of microprogram control and consists of four modules. bach aodule includes twodimensional access me.ory, bit .. nipulation logic, and a highspeed aicroproceaaor (am 2901, a bitalice aicroprocessor of aaerican micro devices, inc.). they are evaluating this associative processing ayatea in several applications, such as handprinted kanji recognition and lsi .. skpattern testing. they are alao developing a relational data base machine baaed on hash and sort, which allows efficient execution of relational algebra operations such as join and projection and set operations. professor riroya fujiaaki's laboratory has 10 people. seven people are working on speech, and three on language (translation). in the international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.24 speech area, the group ia studying apeecb production (generation), speech syntbeais, and speech perception. speech perception is esaentially what we call speech recognition, but pujiaaki aaya that recognition should be investigated by understanding the buaan paycbology. in this reapect, his approach ae ... different fro. the statistical approach taken by p. jelinek et al. at ibm in yorktown. pujiaaki'a apeecb recognition effort concentrates on acoustic proceaaing and phonetic recognition. fujiaaki said that the sounds łb,ł łd,ł and łgł are difficult to distinguish. his recent method, which aakea uae of łtransition rateł par ... tera, can recognise tbea with 95 percent accuracy, wbereaa no other groups have ever achieved accuracy greater than 90 percent. another approach to speech recognition uses syllable recognition. japanese is aoaewbat easier to work with than bngliab in this reapect because it bas only 200 or so syllables whereas english bas about 1000 (partial) syllables. pujiaaki thinks that speech recognition in bngliab will not be practical for another 10 yeara. information science departmentz this department is a spinoff of the physics depart.ent and belongs to the faculty of science. there are four chairs, and we met professors yamada, kunii, and gotob. the department produces 4 ph.d.'s, 8 m.s.'s, and 15 b.s.'s per year. profeaaor biaao yamada described his efforts on a kanjiinput technique. in his scheme, each kanji character is addressed by two strokes, and he claims that his .. chine is not aucb .are difficult to learn than an bngliab typewriter. a 400bour training will allow a person to input 150 characters per ainute, whereas any kanakanji conversion technique will not do better than 100 characters per minute according to yamada. be is very much interested in having the keyboard developed by dick hirsch, of the bu111m factor center of ibm san joae. professor tosbiyasu kunii is interested in data base and aoftware engineering. be is no longer a aember of the fgcs committee and is rather critical about the pgcs project on two counts. first, be aaya, łthe fgcs effort conaina nothing new. they are aggregating existing ideas and bundling thea.ł second, be points out that łthey do not place much emphasis on software, and i believe that software product engineering is important.ł professor biicbi gotob, who earned his fame as the inventor of parametron 25 years ago or so, is now heavily involved in lisp. ria group wrote a lisp interpreter and compiler. his conclusion is łaever sort, but do bashing in aain memory.ł he claims that &lisp, the lisp compiler that be developed, runs faster than that of the university of utah. his machine is called plats (fortranlisp associative bashing set), and it was built, interestingly enough, by mitsui engineering and shipbuilding oo. the work was presented at the sixth ieee annual symposium on computer architecture in 1979. gotob baa also worked on electron lithography. riker and japan electronic optics .. de his electron lithography machine, and ecl of ntt bas bought one. co!lputer center of the university of tokyoz the iiiipressive computer center serves over 4000 researchers from .. ny universities international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of

coupled dual processor of bitac m200b (10 mips per processor) with 16mb storage, and thus the system contains a total of 8 units of n200b and 64mb main storage. there are 8 drums (16 mb each, 120mb in total), for the tss system, 96 spindles of 300mb disks, and 32 spindles of 200mb disks. thus the total disk capacity is 36,880 mb. in addition, a mss (mass storage system) with 706 magnetic tape cartridges (50 mb each, 35,000 mb in total) and 12 spindles of 200mb staging disks are attached. five data communication control processors, and three network processors allow 500 simultaneous terminal (tss and re110te job entry (rjb)) connections. at the center, batch processing service is provided on a łdoityourselfł basis, and the scheme is called advanced openbatch processing. many color crt displays are deployed for this purpose, and the following inputoutput equipaent is provided: 7 card readersj 13 line printers, each with automatic paper cutterj 12 magnetic tape transportsj 1 kanji laserbeaa printer/plotter (720 lines per minute cut sheeta)j and 1 floppy disk. aa for pictureand imageprocessing systems, there are five graphic displays (one highresolution display, three storagescope displays, and one color graphic display), five kanji displays and keyboards, three inkjet kanji printers, and six xy plotters. a vax11/780 is also installed as a subsystem at the center. the operating system is unix (rather than vax/vms of digital bquipaent corporation (dbc)), and this systea is used for the research of software such as os (the operating system of ibm), compiler, and editor. this vax11/780 subsystem can also operate as a re110te batch station on tss terminals of the bitac m200b main system. · fortran 77 is the language used by more than 90 percent of the users, so the center baa a large fortran support software. other available languages are basic, pascal, pl/i cobol, apl, lisp, rbducb (a foraula aanipulator), algol 68, and rpg. this lisp cojiipiler, called blisp as developed by gotoh's group, is one of the fastest lisp coapilers employing hash techniques. the reduce runs under the blisp. in addition, they have text editor and textformulating editor. an inforaation retrieval system called toolir on orion is also available, and several data bases (primarily literature abstracts and indices) are accessible via tss terainals. this huge computer center is operated by 41 people, and there are 13 people (including two associate professors) for research and development tasks. according to gotoh, hitachi is expected to deliver a supercray aachine to this oo.puting center by 1983. kyoto university departmnt of information science: 'l'he departłnt was founded in 1970 and consists of six chairs: inforaation science fundamentals (professor toshiyuki sakai)j logic circuits and automata (professor international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.26 shuzo yajima, associate professor yahiko kambayashi)j co.qputer systeas (professor hiroshi bagiwara, associate professor shinji tomita)j computer software (professor takao tsuda, associate professor masaahi shimasaki)j information systems engineering (professor yutaka ohno). each year 40 students are admitted to the undergraduate program, 18 students to the master's program, and several to the doctoral program. professor sakai's laboratory has approximately 20 people including two assistants (ph.d.'s), 2 ph.d. students, 9 m.s. students, and 5 visiting researchers. the laboratory is divided into three groups: (1) automatic speech processing, (2) picture processing and image understanding, and (3) document understanding. yasuo ariki, an assistant, described a spoken word recognizer (implemented by matsushita) that can recognize isolated japanese words spoken by unspecified speakers. the recognition algorithm is baaed on twostep recognition: phoneme recognition (using reference patterns) followed by word recognition (using a word dictionary). it operates satisfactorily in real time for 10 numerals and 32 city names. in experiments the system achieved 94.3 percent recognition rate for 5 males and 93.3 percent for 5 females according to their report. this prototype system was exhibited at łportopiał held at kobe this summer. michihiko minou, a ph.d. student, demonstrated their storage and retrieval systea for japanese documents. this specific system is designed to handle digitized visiting cards. retrieval of a visiting card is requested either by the character code or by handwritten characters. in both cases, key parameters are extracted from these patterns, and the most likely visiting card is selected by the pattern matching method. the correct retrieval rate is 78 percent in their experiments involving 615 visiting cards stored, when an inquiry is done in character codes, which are then translated into character patterns. kosaka inagaki, an assistant, showed us a parallel processing sytem macsym for fast document processing. the system contains 4 (expandable up to 17) z8001 16bit microprocessors with 128kb local memory and shared memory of 8 mbits (maximum 14 mbits). a newspaper layout understanding system is built on macsym. a newspaper image is fed into the system via a digital facsimile (copix 9700 by toshiba). a news item designated by location is then extracted by using the newspaper layout rule1 the headline is normalized in size1 background patterns are suppressed7 and the text is reconstructed line by line. the processed image is suited for further editing or information retrieval by matching keywords in headlines. professor yutaka ohno's group is working on (1) concurrent lisp, which is a concurrent programming language based on lisp, and a multimicroprocessor for it7 (2) a multimicroprocessor system for threedimensional color graphics, and (3) a data base management system (dbms) for a composite type of distributed data base. he is also investigating functional programming language from the standpoint of software design. ohno will be the general chairman of the sixth international conference on software engineering to be held in tokyo in september 1982. (dr. koji kobayashi, the chairman of nec, is the honorary chairman of the conference.) professor hiroshi hagiwara and associate professor shinji tomita work on computer systems and architecture. a microprogrammable international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.27 cc.puter, gal, has four hollogeneous arithłtic and logical units (alus), suitable for lowlevel parallel processing and for such applications as luge processing, real tił animtion, and language processing (basic, apl, lisp, and pascal). the next version, ga2, is under development (by 10 people for two years) and will be operational in march 1982. it is a user.icroprogr .... ble computer, and its processing power and aicroprograa productivity will be an order of łagnitude higher than those of gal. its software will be in pl/i. professor shuji doshita's group works on (1) complexity theory related to born set&j (2) aachine translation, and (3) a knowledge base. approach to document retrieval. the first subject is concerned with whether the unsatisfiability for a born set in the propositional logic can be decided by unit or input resolution in deterministic polynoaial tiae. the second subject is concerned with their attempt to construct an englishjapanese machine translation system via formal semantic representation based on montague gr .... r. (montague gr .... r is a linguistic theory originated by richard montague in 1974.) toyoaki nishidera, a ph.d. student and assistant, showed us their prototype of a machine translation systeł based on parafaoom 0200. the program is written in lisp. dosbita and his group, although they are not officially affiliated with the pgcs co.aittee, were quite faailiar with prolog as well. overall, we were quite iapressed by the depth and breadth of the work being done in this laboratory. coafuting center of kyoto university1 the computing center bas four cpus of pacon m200, with main storage of 48 mb. the operating system is aultiple virtual storage (mvs). the center is connected through the n1 network (a packet switching network of ntt) to tokyo and six other ujor national universities. more than 1500 batch jobs per day are handled here, and 180 tss users are serviced. about 30 percent of the workload is froa nearby universities and colleges that are connected to this center. bagiwara said that pacon m382 will ooae here in 1982 or 1983. other departmental in parallel with the department of information science discussed above, there is the school of electrical engineering, which consists of three departmental the department of electrical engineering (which has been in existence since 1898), the department of electronics (since 1954), and the department of electrical engineering ii (since 1961). they admit 120 undergraduate students each year and 85 aaster's students. professor makoto nagao, who is a ooa.ittee member of pgcs, belongs to the department of electrical engineering ii. unfortunately, he was out of town, but we met his assistant professor, takashi matsuyama, and junichi nak..ura, a ph.d. student. their current research topics include (1) pattern recognition and

created for implementation on pacom 230/45.5 (256 kb). they are also working on a kanji inputoutput system for japanese wordprocessing applications. professor tadao kasaai, who is internationally known for his earlier work on algebraic coding theory, is now interested in cryptography aa well as in aultiuaer coding theory. ria associate professor, kenichi taniguchi, will soon be visiting the university of california at berkeley to work with professor michael harrison. mr. sugiyama, an assistant, is interested in an algebraic specification language and ita applications. another assistant,

laboratory. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.29 according to kasaai, there were no activities related to languages for data flow .achines. sa.e students are using the interpreter for the simple functional prograaming language that was designed by john backus. professor toshio pujisawa, a wellknown network theorist, is now interested in the computational complexity aspect of layout problems (for pcb, lsi) and placement and wiring. be is also working on the problem of analyzing a large analog circuit that involves a linear equation ax ł y, where a is a larger sparse aatrix. be is faailiar with the work of bob brayton of ibm yorktown. toshio matsuura, an assistant, is using multimicrosystema for softwarerelated work. one is parapacom pfl16a, for which he and his student designed and i.ple .. nted a floppy disk controller and color crt interface. the os is a singleuser version of control program for microprocessor (cp/m), and unixtype file structure is used. professor kensuke takashima was recently appointed professora he was previously a depart.ental director of ntt's yokosuka laboratory. takashima is planning to start a data base aachine project, but he has not acquired a staff yet. associate professor miyahara recently joined the department from kyoto university. be is implementing a microprocessor for simulating queueing network models. z80s are used to represent nodes, and fujitsu 1400 for statistical analysis. be is also planning to develop a local network of the ethernet type using fiber optics (a similar effort exists at taukuba, called gamma net, for which professor ebihara of tsukuba university is the principal investigator). in order to provide łmultiaccess and broadcast channelł characteristics, a device called a starcoupler will be used. the idea is to provide crosstalks between optical fibers that are coupled by this device. according to miyahara, nbc has developed a product that couples 8 fibers, and toshiba is developing a starcoupler for 100 fibers. department of control engineeringa professor saburo tsuji came to the university from etl about 10 years ago and is well known for his longterm involvement in robotics. tsuji says that robotics research in japan has been quite successful in technology transfer in the past 10 years. the use of welding robots is an example. the recent robotic research is concerned with the developaent of robots and robots with vision inspection capability. the latter will be used for seaiconductor production (vision for wirebonding, inspection of regular patterns on masks and wafers) and inspection of pcb in computer aanufacturing. aa for robot languages, tsuji thinks that the united states is .ore advanced than japan. examples are stanford r and mit assembly analysis. according to tsuji, the mechanical engineering laboratory of niti in tsukuba city is working on robots that assist handicapped people, such as a robot that raises a patient's bed. tsuji is actively involved in visionrelated research. be referred us to an article on łindustrial computer vision in japanł that appeared in computer (published by ieee), may 1980, pp. 5062. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.30 pu1itsu laboratories, lt4. hiroshi yaa4a, the director, was our host. tatsuo miyakawa, the manager of the information processing laboratory, and kenicbi miura, a senior engineer in the development division, provided bnglisb translations of yaaada's talk. y ... da gave us a brief introduction to pujitsu and its laboratories. pujitsu bas now established several joint ventures and subsidiaries in the united states including corp., trnpujitsu, inc. (established in may 1980), aaerican teleco.aunications, inc., at anaheim, and pujitsu microelectronics, inc., in san diego (established in 1979). the ca.pany's overall productivity has doubled betwen 1977 and 1981. one of pujitsu's achievements during the past year was the introduction of the world's first bigbelectron.obility transistor (bbmt), which is a new type of transistor based on gaaa technology. they have achieved the switching delay time of 17 ps (picoseconds) per gate, wbicb coapares favorably with the top speeds of the josephson junction. it is approxiaately 30 times faster than a conventional metallic oxide seaiconductor field effect transistor (mospbt). pujitsu laboratories, ltd., is a wholly owned subsidiary of pujitsu limited. it bas 850 employees and eight divisions: research, integrated ca.unications, coiiputer systeł, semiconductors, ca.ponent technology, aaterials, medical engineering, and kansai center. several airelated activities exist: aachine translation (using a seaantic network as the interaediate representation), a handwritten character recognition aethod (an algoritha called łstroke position matrix aetbodł) j and a speakerindependent isolated word recognition system (which accepts telephone quality speed input, based on phonetic analysis and pattern matching). bubble memories, plasma displays, bbmt, josephson junction, and optical devices were mentioned as research issues. dr. yaaada then expressed his personal opinion about the pgcs project. miti's plan on pgcs is not definite yet, and fujitsu has not yet decided on bow to deal with the fgcs project. in yaada's view, the objectives are vague, whereas mitisponsored projects in the past bad clear targets, such as mips figures. although miti officials are asking for international cooperation, they do not seem to know how to handle it because they have had no previous experience. despite all these uncertainties, it is certain that fujitsu will participate in fgcs, but specific details had not yet been deterained. during the 1990s, the biggest problem will be software, but the pgcs plan does not provide a clear view of this problem, yaaada says. fujitsu is interested in artificial intelligence because a solution to the software bottleneck problem may be found there. their emphasis is on aachine translation and intelligent robots. (there is a small effort in data flow machines at fujitsu, related to control of robots.) pujitsu does not have enough experience to aake any coaaents on lisp versus prolog and on whether data flow machines are proper hardware or not. we then took a tour of the plant where facom m380/382, fujitsu's largest machine, is assembled. it was announced in may 1981, and its first customer shipment will be in early 1982. the m380 uses speed lsi logic chips (400 and 1300 logic gates per chip and 350ps international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.31 gate propagation delay, as co.pared with 1 na (nanosecond) for the ibm highspeed ram (3081) with access ti .. of 5.5 na). highdensity multichip carriers (mcc) and their horizontal stacking design improve the m380'a internal speed. an approximately onefootsquare mcc can acca.odate up to 121 lsi logic and ram chips. the power conawaption is 28 kva, and air cooling is used. it has three levels of storage hierarchys 64mb local buffer, 256kb global buffer storage, and 64mb main storage. ita clock time is 16 na, and they claim that the m380 is so percent faster than the ibm 3081. ita multiprocessor version m382 can have a 128mb aain me.ory. several technical presentations were given by research staff memberas maaayaahi tezuka of the advanced software section discussed their relational data base system called rdb/vi, which consists of an interactive subsystem for relational query (isrq), a data storage and control subsystem (dscs), and an application subsystem. ita query language rdb/ql is similar to sql. a software called plahhbr has been developed on rdb/vi by incorporating a geographical inforaation subsystem (giving the population of different age groups, and so on). a demonstration of plannbr on facom m200 was later given to us. it bas color graphic display support, and a japanese language support is planned. s. uchida talked about the aachine translation system called atlas/u. they adopted the transfer approach rather than the pivot approach. the key strategies of atlas/u are (1) to adopt a conceptual network as a representation of the intermediate level, (2) to .phaaize seaantic analysis, (3) to select syntax and words by pattern matching and expression rules, and (4) to learn by examples. five people worked for two years on atlas/u. the atlas/u is used for c011puter manual translation from japanese to bngliah. it uses kanakanji conversion for the japanese input, and ita limitation is the size of the dictionary. the current version contains 10,000 japanese words and 40,000 bnglish words. we also saw their speech recognition system. it requires a 0.6a pause between phrases and handles 1000 words (256 b per word). a handwritten character recognition system uses feature extraction techniques by projecting patterns to different directions, line densities, and so on. other noteworthy items discussed or shown in the exhibit room were as followss a gaas field effect transistor (pet) amplifier (5.9 to 6.4 gbz) was developed to replace the traveling wave tube (twt). a largecapacity disk drive called eagle i (f6421), which baa 446mb capacity and 1.859mbit/s data rate and is comparable to the ibm 3380. its first cuato.er is in 1983. ita enhanced version, eagle ii (f6425), will be available in 1984. magnetic bubble me.ary for 1mbit devices is under a bubble microco.puter is being considered. as for very high speed switching devices, josephson gaaa and rbmt are being pursued by five to six people in each area. pujitau established in 1973 the international institute for advanced study of social information science (liassis) with kitagawa (professor e.eritua of applied mathematics at kyuahu university) as ita director. in april 1980, it .aved from laaata, tokyo, to a new independent building inside the humazu ooaplex of international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of

system science, mathematical science, and physical science. they appointed professor r. bellaan (matheaatics), professor b.r. caianiello (environ.ental science), and aany other foreign scholars aa visiting fellows. according to their brochure, professor raymond yeh, of the university of maryland, also serves as a counselor. we did not visit the institute, but kan ... kobayashi, of this institute, gave a presentation, łprograa design transformation,ł which discussed the specification language, design language, and iaplementation language froa the knowledge engineering viewpoint. lastly, m. sugi110to of the engineering departjient, development division, gave a talk, łsoftware diagraa increase software productivity.ł the staff of liassis developed a software design tool called the fujitsu essential software diagraa description (fbsdd) as a mans for software docwaentation (for both design specification and isplemental specification) and as tools for supporting the topdown design and iaplełntation. be touched on prolog, although it aeeaa to have no direct bearing on fbsdd. hitachi central research laboratory. the hitachi central research laboratory, situated in the peaceful surroundings of kokubunji, a suburb of tokyo, was founded in 1942. it has 800 research ..bare, 160 of whoa have doctorates, and 350 support people. it is one of six corporate laboratories. the others are hitachi research laboratory (1260 people), mechanical research laboratory (550), engineering research laboratory (250), production research laboratory (420), and system laboratory (280). in addition, there are division labor a tor lea (conswaer product research center, design center, and device center). of the 74,000 hitachi employees, 8,000 are in rłd (5,000 in plants and divisions and 3,000 in the laboratories). rid expenditures for hitachi are $600 million per year (5.9 percent of sales), and expenditures for the central research laboratory are 860 million per year. of the research budget, 45.3 percent ia for łindependent researchł and the remaining 54.7 percent is for łsponsored researchł (45.7 percent from plants and business groups, 8 percent froa subsidiary coapanies, and 4 percent from the govern.nt). bisashi borikoahi, manager of the eighth departjient, was our boat. be told us that computer manufacturers do not have much involvemnt in fgcs, although k. torii of hitachi is on the architecture subcommittee. hitachi does not have many pgcsrelated activities yet, although a language translation effort exists. however, another miti project, the super computer project under dr. kashiwagi of btl, involves heavily the six major computer companies (fujitsu, hitachi, nbc, mitsubishi, toshiba, and oki). the major research target of the super computer project is technologies such as gaas and josephson junction, and hitachi, fujitsu, and nbc as well as btl are working on these technologies. we were then taken to various laboratories. mr. suzuki discussed their efforts on magnetic bubbles. a 1mbit chip has now been international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.33 transferred to the product division (16to 64lbit chips have already been used for ntt'a bss). this 1mbit chip will be used for nuaerical control (nc). a 4mbit bubble card is now planned as the next project. ita potential applications include point of sale, processing computer, office computers, acoustic and portable systems. in the robotics laboratory, mr. bjiri gave us a brief account of the history of hitachi robots& a prototype intelligent robot called bivip mrk 1 (1970)r a coapact packaging robot, bitband mrk 2 (1972)r a precision inserting robot, bitband bxpert2 (1973), an electro.otor aaaellbly robot, experts (1975), and so on. be also showed us a vacuua cleaner aasellbler robot and a nuclear reactor inspection robot. about 50 industrial robots are sold per month. hitachi's competitors are kawaakijuko (strong in large robots) and tateiahi ooapany. aa for the robotics in japan, bjiri referred us to a survey paper written by s. tsuji of osaka university that appeared in co!puter (see the section on osaka university). we were also shown a d..anstration of a tssbaaed docu.entediting system, called tps/ii. an a4aize sheet (typically 1000 characters) requires 2 hours for kana input, and 30 minutes for lanakanji conversion. (professor yamada's system at the university of tokyo will operate 2 to 3 ti .. s faster after operators are trained.) the system seeaa too slow for any practical use and has the homonym problem in the lanakanji conversion. a sentence in the da.onstration had the word łahocboł as the subject of the sentence, which is supposed to mean łhead of institute (or research center).ł but the kanji that appeared on the screen after kanakanji conversion was a homonym, łbead of police (or fire) station.ł the operator rejected this word, hit a key, and got another homonym, łfirst aenatruation.ł she proaptly hit the key again and finally got the right word, łhead of institute.ł a ca.puter network (binet) that connects the central research laboratory and musashino laboratory (1.2 km away) is using fiber optics with a data rate of 20 mbits/s. in vlsi design, they are working on co.ple .. ntary .. tallic oxide seaiconductor (cmos) chips with 20 k gates with autoaatic place .. nt and wiring. they use hierarchical structure, where a block (basic unit of logic) contains 500 to 1000 gates. they are also working on a verification prograa for physical checking. they also talked about a cmos master slice with 6 k gates, where an autoaatic placement and wiring program (mazerunning algoritha) is used. they then told us about a highend machine, the bitac m2808. it will have 12 to 17 mips and use pipelining and buffer lsi (4 kbita, 5.5 na), logic lsi (1500 gates, 0.5 ns), and aain ae.ary lsi (65 kb, access time 150 na). as for the vector processor and vector compiler, they discussed bap1 (hitachi array processor, type 1). its speed is 250 mplops, as co.pared with cray1 (170 mplops), facom 23/75 ap (25 mplops), and bit.ac m2808iap (integrated array processor) (35 mplops). they said that miti'a national project baa the goal of 10 bflops. miti plana to deliver its super machine in 1988, whereas bap1 will be delivered in 1983. they started the hap project two years ago with five or six international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.34 people, and now about 40 people are engaged in this development effort. of these, 20 are logic designers (about 10 experienced designers and 10 new people), and the remaining 20 include assistants (for drawing), secretaries, and so on. packaging is designed by another group. hec (rippon electric company) central research laboratories. the r'd organization of hec underwent an extensive reorganization in july 1980 and divided to form the research and development group and the production engineering development group. the former handles basic technology research, and the latter, production technology and productivity. the research and group consists of the basic technology research laboratory (300 people), the c.c systems research laboratories (200 people), the optoelectronics research laboratory (70 people), the software product engineering laboratory (50 people), and the resources and environment protection laboratory (40 people). the phrase łc.cł was coined by hec to signify their commitment to the integration of łcomputer and communications.ł the cic systems research laboratories include the communication research laboratory, the coaputer systems research laboratory, the application system research laboratory, the peripheral equipment research laboratory, and the boae electronics research laboratory. our hosts were yukio mizuno, the associate senior vice president, koji hezu, the assistant general manager, and sohei misaki and shuji hakada, all of the software product engineering laboratory. according to them, hec has approximately 10,000 people engaged in software development: the number includes those at software companies that are hec's subsidiaries. they briefly discussed their software development maintenance system (sdms). it is an integrated software development system and has been used at several departments within hec. sdms has five subsystems: the project management subsystem, the design subsystem, the programming subsystem, the test subsystem, and the product management subsystem. they then talked about a new system construction model that unifies controlflowbased modularization techniques (a la h. wirth and d. parnas) and dataflowbased modularization techniques (a la m.a. jackson and j.p. morrison). the modularization is intended to allow stepwise comprehension of the complex system and the development of the modules to proceed in parallel. the new model combines baaed techniques (in which modules are connected by module call relations) and dataflowbased techniques (in which modules are connected by their inputoutput data streams). the design methodology and tools based on this model are incorporated in a subsystem of sdms, and have been used extensively by 10 projects. cobol and fortran do not have features to realize the structure defined by the model; therefore a tool has been developed to add these features to cobol and fortran. they presented the work at compcoh 81, held in washington, d.c., on september 1517, 1981. a discussion of software quality control (swqc) followed. software quality features include functionality, acceptability, performance, international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.35 modifiability, and reliability. the prime vehicle of swqc is the łoc circle,ł where programmers expose their mistakes to their colleagues, with no management involved. specific tools of swqc are data sortingstratification, control chart, pareto's chart, and cause and effect diagram. after these technical presentations, we were taken to an exhibit room where we saw, among other things, their speech recognition device, dp100. it can recognize spoken words of limited vocabulary. applications of such a primitive speech recognition system include baggage or parcel sorting, simulation for air traffic control, and voiceassisted input for cad. another interesting prototype in the exhibit room was a fingerprint viewer. at the end of our visit we had a luncheon meeting with michiyuki uenohara, the senior vice president and director of research. uenohara used to be on the technical staff of bell laboratories, where he was involved in research on parametric amplifiers. unlike some of the other executives we met at fujitsu and hitachi, uenohara was quite positive and supportive about the objective and significance of the fgcs project. dewar's report on trip to japan i arrived in japan the week before the fgcs conference and so was able to attend the meeting of the information processing society of japan (ipsj) at the university of tokyo and to meet informally with some japanese computer scientists, many of whom were involved in the fgcs work. since nearly all university faculty and students were at the ipsj meeting, i was able to meet, briefly at least, with many university professors. more extensive meetings were arranged with the followinga professor e. goto, chairman of the information science department at the university of tokyo (the inventor of parametron), now working on the flats (lisp baaed) machine and not directly involved in pgcs work; professor akinori yonezawa, tokyo institute of technology (who received his ph.d. from mit with professor hewitt), working on specification of the data base management system (dbms); professor katayama, tokyo institute of technology, working on hierarchical functional programming (bfp), a language baaed on attribute grammars; professor izumi kimura, tokyo institute of technology, working in the area of software engineering and text editing (the latter being a much more significant field in japan due to character set and language problema); koichi furukawa, electrotechnical laboratory (etl), one of the main workers in the prolog aspect of pgcs; and reiji nakajima, university of kyoto, working on the iota language. in addition, i met with professors yoneda and wada from the university of tokyo, who are colleagues in the international federation of information processing (ifip) working group 2.1 (the programming languages working group, of which i am chairman). as requested by the computer science and technology board, i discussed the issue of translation of japanese technical materials with the university people i met. at least among the academic contacts, international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.36 there was remarkably agre ... nt that there were no łateriala of academic interest beyond those published in the major journals of ipsj and of the institute of electronics and ca.aunication engineers {iece). furthermore, both societies publish part of their work in english. por example, goto'a last three papers have been published in the englishlanguage version of the proceedings of the ipsj journal, which appears quarterly and carries, in addition to papers from japanese computer scientists {one must be an ipsj member to publish), englishlanguage abstracts of all papers recently published in the society's japaneselanguage journals. interestingly, although several hundred acm members in japan receive ca.aunications of the association for co!puting machinery {acm) and other acm journals, fewer than 20 u.s. scientists, including japanese residents, are ipsj members receiving ipsj journals. even including library subscriptions, fever than 80 copies of the englishlanguage proceedings of the ipsj journal are received in the united states. the single moat important step that could be taken to increase knowledge of japanese work would be to promote and encourage access to this journal in the united states. the papers in it represent a useful cross section of current work, and the translated abstracts provide thorough coverage. of course, as is the case in the united states, the acad .. ic journals do not fully cover the hardware manufacturing field, but nevertheless it is significant that the japanese computer scientists i talked to believed it would be a waste of time to look beyond the major journals. unlike some major industrial concerns in japan, the academic community is eager to have ita work better known in the united states, so i take these judgments at face value. i should note that not all articles are from universities. in one sample copy i received, there was a long article by workers at hitachi, on vm iapla.entation, which clearly reflected ongoing work of commercial relevance, and which i found to be most informative. since i had heard that there had been discussions between acm and ipsj on joint membership plana, i arranged a meeting with masumi sakamoto, the secretary general of ipsj. it seems that both sides are favorably disposed to the idea, but bureaucratic problems, particularly on the japanese aide, where the directorship changes each year, have so far delayed any real progress. such an arrangement would be highly desirable, and ways to encourage acm to pursue this possibility should be investigated. i also visited the university of tokyo computer center. this is an impressive installation, built around eight topoftheline hitachi models {approximately 200 mips of general purpose computing power) with 128 mb of fast main memory and an amazing array of peripherals. this machine is freely available for use by academic computer scientists, in contrast to the situation at most u.s. universities, where meaningful efforts to provide highcapability computing have generally been abandoned. this discrepancy is helping japan to close what might be called the łsoftware gap.ł with very few exceptions, the computing environments at u.s. universities tend to be hostile to major software projects. the commitment to avoid this situation in japan is evident. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.37 i was quite disappointed with the pgcs conference itself on two counts. pirst, the project seems to be grounded in the uncritical acceptance of a number of pragmatically dubious, avantgarde computer science concepts, including functional programming in general and prolog in particular, data flow machines, objectbased architectures, relational data base machines, and advanced ai concepts. of course, all these areas represent challenging research fields, which are in fact quite well represented in u.s. universities. however, it is my opinion, and one that i found to be shared by nearly all the western computer scientists present, that the miti commitment to this risky research line for a hightechnology, industrybased project is premature and that what is needed instead is a great deal of fundamental research, in which japan has not been as successful as in pure technology. this concern is shared by a number of japanese academic computer scientists, who, although no doubt more enthusiastic than i concerning the technical directions that japan has chosen to emphasize, are nevertheless concerned that there is no good mechanism for causing miti funds to flow into advanced university research. in his address, professor b.a. feigenbaum of stanford university, although naturally enthusiastic over the basic ai direction, warned that this had to be regarded as an area requiring substantial basic research and, within the bounds of decorum, ridiculed the premature commitment to prolog as the central language. the second aspect of my disappointment was that the presentations were glossy, general talks complete with fancy slides, no doubt well suited for discussions with highlevel funding agents, but remarkably devoid of technical content. all attempts to obtain specific information by direct questions were deflected. either the project is even more vague than it appears, or there is a definite desire to avoid specific technical information interchange. computer scientists with whom i spoke directly, however, seemed open and eager to exchange information. i do not believe that the software and systems aspects of this miti project are destined to be successful unless major changes of direction occur, which currently seems unlikely. however, it should be noted that the hardware aspect (e.g., building super personal computers) will almost certainly succeed. to the extent that miti pgcs funds are ca.mitted in this direction, japan's enormous potential in this area will be further increased as will the competition they provide to u.s. industry. conclusions 1. u.s. computer scientists need more information on computer science and technology in japan. 2. much information on japanese computer science and technology is available in english, but it is not readily accessible to most u.s. coaputer scientists. 3. some translation of japanese papers in computer science is needed on a continuing, albeit selected, basis. of highest priority is international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.38 the translation of joho shori gakkai ronbunshi and section d of the transactions of the institute of electronics and com.unication engineers (about lso pages per .onth). of next priority is section c of the transactions (about so pages per month) and the proceedings of the conferences of the ipsj and the iece (600900 pages per year). of lower priority, but still worth continuing, is the translation of the special interest group newsletters (8001600 pages per month). a possible alternative to translation might be the annual publication of a directory of japanese ca.puter science researchers and research projects. recommendations 1. continued translation of selected japanese journals, theses, and books should be established under u.s. government sponsorship. titles and abstracts of translated aaterials should be published in computing reviews (or an equivalent journal). these translations should be economically viable after a few years of government sponsorship. 2. a prograa should be established to send selected speaking ca.puter scientists in this country to japan as guest workers. an intensive language program for a few specialists who do not speak japanese could be included. such a program could be funded by some existing private organization such as the american federation of information processing scientists or the association for computing machinery, or it could be funded by the u.s. government. 3. acadeaic centers of expertise on japanese computing should be established in the united states or in japan. u.s. government funding should be provided to support these centers in the continuing review and analysis of japanese activities and (possibly) in the activities recommended above. these centers should be encouraged to interact with japanese organizations such as the japan information processing development center (jipdec), the information technology promotion agency (ipa), miti 's electrotechnical laboratory (btl), and various other governmental and industrial centers of ca.puter expertise. the existence of these centers should be advertised in u.s. computer journals, and american ca.puter scientists should be encouraged to use the facilities. institutions that are known to have strong programs in both ca.puter science and east asian studies and that therefore would be wellsuited to host such centers include stanford university, harvard university, and the university of hawaii. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.chapter 2 developments in western europe the situation in the western european countries with respect to the availability of computer science information is different from that in japan in two significant ways. first, there is generally good cation between american and western european computer scientists, and, second, the american scientist can read most of the important research results in english. in the past, there has always been good communication between american and western european computer scientists. for example, algol 60 was developed in the early 1960s by an international committee of thirteen that included three or four americans, as well as people from prance, germany, england, switzerland, and the netherlands. many american computer scientists have close ties with european scientists and institutions and have spent a year or two in europe. further, a fair number of europeans have american ph.d.'s and tend to maintain their ties to the united states. the better u.s. universities and research laboratories usually have at least one european visitor in computer sciences each year, and often more. the american conferences on theory of computation, principles of programming languages, and so on, are well attended by europeans. in addition, the major research journals, such as the journal of the association for computing machinery (acm), siam journal on computing, software practice and experience, and acta informatica, have international editorial boards. the international federation for information processing (ifip) provides a formal means for fostering communication, as explained in chapter 6. the working group meetings and conferences promote national understanding, encourage joint research, and disseminate research ideas before they reach the publication stage. a number of international workshops in europe, some sponsored by nato, have also stimulated communication. personal contact is one of the best ways to make research ideas more widely known. however, effective cooperation necessitates direct contact and travel. support of such travel by appropriate funding agencies is critical to maintain and improve the ability of american computer scientists to benefit from european resources. of course, not every computer scientist has close ties to europe, and to some extent all scientists must rely on the literature to discover what is happening elsewhere. fortunately, english is close to 39 international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.40 being the language of publication and caa.unication for european ca.puter scientists, perhaps partly to foster ca.aunication aaong themselves. a majority of thea have traveled in the united states or england and can converse fluently in english, and al.jiost all can read and write english. english is the official language of many european ca.puter science conferences. further, publishers such as north bolland, springer, and prentice ball are international and publish many works of european authors in english. this is not to say that all work is done in english. sa.e results go unnoticed because they are not in english. but, by and large, tbe important work finds its way into english, and, if it does not, at least it is in one of the european languages, which are more understandable to u.s. scientists than, say, russian or japanese. survey op important journals as a first attempt at producing quantitative information on research available in english, a list was made of all articles published in eleven journals (see table 21 for a list of the journals) and in the springer verlag lecture notes series. the list included the title of the article, the author(s), and his or her country. an article with two authors from different countries was listed twice. this list is given by author's country in appendix e and by source in appendix p. this is a representative set of journals, ranging in areas covered froa theoretical ca.puter science to practical software to hardware. it contains american journals (e.g., ca..unications of the acm) as well as those published in foreign countries (e.g., acta inforaatica and information processing letters). of about 720 articles appearing in these journals in 1980, about 325 of these were written by people in countries other than the united states. only seven articles were written in a foreign language. thirtythree countries, including .oat of the western european countries, are represented. the countries represented most heavily are the united states (393), england (48), canada (47), germany (47), france (27), the netherlands (25), israel (20), japan (19), and italy (15). such statistics tend to confirm our opinion that, in general, the western european ca.puter scientists do want to publish in english, and in the wellknown, respected journals. survey op sc»>b european cohfbrbhces as in the united states, a nuaber of conferences, workshops, and advanced courses are held in western europe each year. to determine the extent of american participation in these conferences and the availability of the research, the proceedings of eight conferences held in 1980 were surveyed. all these proceedings appeared in the springer verlag lecture note series (springer verlag is primarily a german publisher). appendix g contains a list of the conferences surveyed. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.41 table

topics ranged from data bases to programming to semantics to computeraided design. they were held in five different countries (italy, prance, germany, the netherlands, and denmark). about one third of the papers were given by americans (61 of 198), and only three papers were not given in english. thus it seems that in order to promote communication among themselves, europeans turn to english. conclusions 1. since most western european computer scientists speak english fluently and tend to publish in english, no new translation facilities are necessary. 2. personal contacts between american and western european computer scientists are very important in the dissemination of research ideas, and should be stimulated. recommendations 1. no extra translation facilities are needed. 2. a formal survey, organized by scientific area and covering important work in all western european countries, would help to make existing materials more accessible and more widely known. the possible role of ifip working groups in this endeavor should be explored. personal contacts and travel should be stimulated by increasing and making more readily available foreign travel funds. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.chapter 3 developments in eastern europe and the ussr the literature review made to assess developments in eastern europe and the ussr involved the following countries: bulgaria, czechoslovakia, german democratic republic, hungary, poland, rumania, and the union of soviet socialist republics (ussr). these countries are part of the council for mutual economic assistance, usually abbreviated as comecon, cmea, or cema in the western literature. the other comecon member nations, cuba and outer mongolia, were not included here. the primary objective of the review was to search for publications that cover developments relating to computer science within these countries. the review focuses almost entirely on the ussr due to its dominance in the field. the majority of the theoretical articles from russia and eastern europe come from journals published by the academic community. these are sent to the association for computing machinery (acm). the acm publishes the monthly computing reviews, which contains abstracts from approximately 420 periodicals. fourteen of these are soviet journals in, or closely related to, computer science and are included as covertocover translations into english. these fourteen publications include the most important soviet computer science literature (see appendix h). the soviets' knowledge that these periodicals are translated encourages the soviet academic community to make them their first choice for publishing papers. the time that passes from the publication of the russian original until the publication of the english translation is about eight months on the average, and varies from six months to one year. this should be regarded as good service, since the delays in the publication of the original are often greater. in these periodicals there are few articles by authors living outside the soviet union. eastern european authors tend to publish in the journals of their own country. if an article is published outside the native country, there seems to be a greater effort to publish in a western journal, in english, than to publish in a soviet journal. in addition to identifying the soviet journals received by computing reviews, we scanned available material since 1975 through the system development corporation's (soc) search service. many of the 475 resulting abstracts deal with typical developmental problems, rather than theoretical discussions. it is not known what percentage of these abstracts might also appear in translated journals listed in appendix h. 42 international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.43 a simple test was devised to identify and quantify the number of references to comecon authors in western computer science and mathematical papers. it was assuaed that the number of comecon authors cited in various papers would provide an indication of the degree to which their material is being read. for this purpose, twelve issues of the communications of the acm from the period 1979 to 1981 were selected. no soviet or eastern european authors were among the 1203 references in these issues. it would be ineffective at this tt.e to translate more journals from the comecon countries, since the material already being translated into english is not being used by western computer scientists. in the field of mathematics, the soviets have an excellent reputation, and american authors make far better use of their work. an issue of the transactions of the american mathematical society (volume 261, 1980) was taken as a sample. of ita 30 papers, 9 referenced one or more soviet papers. of the total of 473 references, 11 were to soviet papers. if it is not the language barrier that prevents westerners from being acquainted with the work of the soviet and eastern european computer scientists, what is it? the general political condition in the soviet union, and in the eastern european countries to a lesser extent, prevents technical people from attending conferences and seminars. this restriction inhibits the development of personal which is essential for a successful exchange of ideas. other reasons might also be suggested for the lack of references to soviet work. for example, there may be too much emphasis on theory to be of interest to westerners, or the mass of available western material may be considered higherpriority reading. in any case, the american computer science community needs to become more aware of the material that is available, instead of increasing the amount of translation at this time. one problem experienced in this literature search was how to determine what was available when no prior knowledge of a specific article or journal existed. that is why the general electronic scan of material was made through a library that used the system development corporation's search service. this service maintains approximately so different data bases, which cover all areas of science and technology, social science, and business. a search used the following criteria: (1) comecon countries and china, (2) material since 1975, (3) any language, and (4) abstract keys such as computer science, data processing, hardware, and software. the search was conducted on four data bases with the following results: for the ntis data base, the number of hits was 256j for compbndex, 44j for elcom, 39j and for inspbc, 136j for a total of 475. these abstracts fill 295 pagesj the total searchandprint cost averaged per abstract. no attempt was made to determine the percentage of duplication or of irrelevant articles located due to an inappropriate selection of search keys. the search costs are reasonable and allow one to identify material quickly from many sources that is unavailable in the printed library indexes. if the data bases were greatly expanded to encompass the computer science citations of international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.44 foreign countries, a significant part of the literature search problem would be solved. it is encouraging to report that there may be an automated retrieval system in the soviet union. frank columbus, of plenua publishing company, provided some interesting information regarding document translation, the availability of material, and the aarket potential of translated journals. plenum currently translates .ore than 30 soviet books and more than 90 soviet journals annually. it was emphasized that availability of information is not a problem and that a russian data base with technical citations exists. the greatest problem is the lack of demand for the translated product. recent budget constraints have caused cutbacks in the funds allocated to public, corporate, and academic libraries. the first thing libraries cut back on or eliminate is foreign subscriptions and translations. the two main factors they consider are cost, which is significantly higher for translated material, and usage. the advantage of locating material by using an automated search is that specific articles can be located easily without the library's having to purchase the books or journals. in addition, the search software system usually maintains informative statistics on the nature of the inquiries and selection counts for the citations. by not translating the articles, or by translating only an abstract, a more current and extensive file of citations can be maintained. the problea of translating still exists, but the volume of translation can be significantly reduced. only articles that met the search criteria of the inquirer and had abstracts confirming that interest would need to be translated. it is recommended that additional discussions be held with plenum publishing company, other interested publishers, and library search services to gain aore information about the possibilities of obtaining access to foreign literature data files. a qualified organization could describe the process of verifying the availability of foreign search services, obtaining the data files, integrating them into existing search services, obtaining citation updates and maintenance, and obtaining the source material. the cost and time frame involved with the above tasks could thus be identified. among the abstracts obtained from soc's search service, a reference was found to a cooperative effort among the comecon members regarding a scientific and technical information system. the citation is included as figure 31. abstract creation and translation are easier when tables of contents for foreign journals are given both in russian and in english, as in figures 32 and 33. all other parts of this particular journal are in russian. in some cases, the table of contents may serve as a substitute for an abstract if the titles are sufficiently descriptive. implementation of a system of automated search and selective translation would greatly help in deciding which material would be translated first, since the final user would make that evaluation. sources of translators include agrew techtran, inc., 21050 erwin street, p.o. box 789, woodland hills, california 913651 and

result in a cost of approximately $40 per page. the american mathematical society (ams) and commercial publishers have lists of freelance translators, who charge significantly less, the ams has obtained translations for $9 per page. another source is the aaerican council for immigrants and professionals in new york. it must be emphasized that professional knowledge of the coaputer industry is necessary in addition to basic translating skills. although additional translation appears unnecessary over the short term, the journals listed in table 31 may be future candidates. the computer science content of these journals is estimated at 20 percent or less. entry 6 is interesting because it is a special issue on the ryad lossm. it is difficult to determine the status of the coaputer science industry in countries where .est aaterial is very general or theoretical, as it is in eastern europe and the ussr. detailed manuals regarding hardware and software products are not available.

developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.49 conclusions 1. translations of russian materials in coaputer science are adequate, but the translated material is apparently ignored. 2. no additional effort to translate soviet periodicals is necessary at this time. 3. the materials available from the soviet union reflect the progress in theory rather than advances in application and hardware. 4. eastern europe and the ussr will continue to show interest in representative technology from the western computer industry. s. standardization of u.s. federal inputoutput specifications aay increase compatability with eastern european peripherals. 6. attendance at eastern european trade fairs is necessary to observe trends. recommendations 1. american scientists should be alerted to the fact that they probably underuse soviet computer science material available in english. 2. the review of present computer science material from the ussr and the identification of the most promising or interesting articles 1114y be useful. 3. attendance at the leipzig and the bruno trade fairs, as well as at those in hannover and moscow, should be encouraged, to identify new products and trends in eastern europe. 4. the status of the ussr automated data base of technical literature and the feasibility of transferring this data base to some u.s. library search system should be examined. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.chapter 4 developments in latin america the state of computer science research and the quality of technical publications in 15 latin american countries (argentina, bolivia, brazil, chile, colombia, costa rica, cuba, dominican republic, ecuador, guatemala, mexico, panama, peru, uruguay, and venezuela) were reviewed. personal contacts as well as ulrich's international periodicals directory (published by r.r. bowker, 19th edition, 1980) were used as the priaary information sources. discussions with key foreign technologists were helpful in refining the data further. the search identified nine technical publications related to computer science. colombia and brazil have three each1 cuba, mexico, and peru have one each. the titles of the individual publications and related details are given in appendix i. these nine publications focus on four subject areasz (l) systems engineering with an emphasis on local user group interests1 (2) industry news1 (3) review of industry trends, including translations of englishlanguage articles from datamationr and (4) journalistic (low technical content) reportage on national projects. none of the publications seems to have a tradition of attracting seainal papers of significant interest to the u.s. scholarly community. serious latin american researchers prefer to publish in english, in u.s. journals, to reach more of their peers. a second type of significant technical literature is the proceedings of international conferences taking place in latin america. they are usually published in english and are widely available to the u.s. scholarly community. a selected list of centers of competence in computing in brazil follows a 1. federal university of rio de janeiro (systems engineering, operations/research, computational complexity, microelectronics), 2. catholic pontifical university, rio de janeiro (data base, electrical engineering, automation theory)j 3. unicamp, sao paulo (laser technology, software engineering), 4. pure and applied mathematics instituter s. econometrics (embrapa) instituter 6. ibicit (brazilian institute of technical information). so international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.51 conclusions 1. much of the research reflects the fact that the rłd are in a buildup phase. 2. there are several centers of excellence in coaputer science. 3. major progress in computer science is not expected for the next three to five years. 4. matheaatical programming and operations research expertise are acre prevalent that traditional computer sciences, reflecting the close relationship to european inforaatics. rbcommbndations 1. the current quality of the latin american computer scienceengineering literature warrants merely an ad hoc translation effort. 2. there are emerging centers of competence in computer science, particularly in brazil, whose technical output might merit translation in three to five years. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.chapter 5 dbvblopmbnts in tbb pboplb' s republic op china the purposes of the study on developments in the people's republic of china are as follows& (l) to identify sources of information on co.puter science in the people's republic of china that are available to the united statesr (2) to determine the adequacy of these tion sources, in teras of their capabilities to provide ti .. ly and valuable informationr and (3) to make recommendations regarding ways to improve our understanding of china's computer science. more than 100 articles and books, most of them published after 1977, were consulted in the course of preparing this chapter. however, the subject area is so vast that we have probably succeeded in accessing only a small portion of the total relevant information. thus we do not claim that the following is a complete picture of co.puter science developments in cbinar it is merely a first step toward a systematic study of the topic. we have identified 11 information sources that collectively provide an excellent picture of chinese computer science developments. l. china. ł ł several national organizations are involved in exchanges with they are as follows& the committee on scholarly communication with the people's republic of china (cscprc) , a focal point for academic and scholarly exchanges with china since 1972. the committee is sponsored by the american council of learned societies, the national academy of sciences, and the social science research council. it coordinates u.s.cbina scholar exchange prograas and publishes the china exchange newsletter, which contains timely information on exchange activities, academic activities in china, a bibliography on china, and so on. it also keeps a small but interesting library of references on china. the national council for u.s.cbina trade. the trade council produces a bimonthly publication titled the china business review and various reports that often contain valuable information on china's computer science education, research,. and industry (for example, see reference (13) in appendix j). the directory of research institutes in china (36) published in 1978 is particularly useful for general background on 52 international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.ł 53 china's scientific research and on their computer science before 1978. a useful companion to the directory is another publication of the trade council, this one on china's professional societies (8) ł the national committee on u.s.china relations (ncuscr). in addition to conducting exchange programs, the committee provides a wide range of information and advisory services on exchanges with china. the committee also publishes a letter, notes from the national committee. the sponsored delegates publish trip reports. for additional information, see (29). 2. information on chinese computer science is available from several u.s. government agencies: ł joint publications research service (jprs). jprs publications contain information primarily from foreign newspapers, periodicals, and books as well as information from news agency transmissions and broadcasts. one of the jprs journals, china report: science and technology, includes uptodate tion on china's computer science and technology, as well as on chinese scientists and scientific organizations. ł national technical information service. ntis distributes jprs publications and people's republic of china scientific abstracts in agriculture; economic affairs; plant and installation data; political, sociological, and military affairs; and science and technology. ł national foreign assessment center, central intelligence agency. the center publishes reports and directories ł concerning china, such as (14). science attaches at u.s. missions in china. science attaches will respond to specific requests for information and/or assistance. 3. one of the most effective ways to gather information is through the use of computerreadable online data base retrieval systems, which are now accessible by almost all major libraries. much of the tion for this chapter was obtained from the data base systems dialog and pts predalert. 4. many american libraries have extensive chinese collections (40) including useful directories (for example, (35)) and chinese journals. through journal exchange programs, some of these libraries, such as the stanford hoover library, are able to acquire journals published by various chinese universities and research organizations that are usually not available outside china. s. university centers for asian studies are another source of information. at stanford university, the northeast asiaunited states forum on international policy carries out multidisciplinary research on such topics as the interface between the social sciences and technology. as an example, one student in the program is currently doing research on the impact of computers on the chinese society of the future. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.54 6. published·and unpublished trip reports by individualł and delegations who have visited china are an important source of tion about china. the cscprc library houses many such reports. in addition, columbia university has a collection of trip reports in its china documentation center. in the area of coaputer science, there have been a number of informative trip reports, including (1), (2), (3) 1 (11) 1 (17) 1 (19) 1 (21) 1 (22) 1 (30) 1 (34) o 7. coaputer coapanies and translating services also can provide information on chinaa ł chinese science and technology (cst). this journal contains unabridged translations of documents froa china on its ł contemporary developments in science and technology. china translation printing services (ctps). thił business firm, appointed by chinese authorities, provides translation and publishing services in science and technology. it publishes uschina electronics, a docwaent produced in chineh by the chinese pourth ministry of machine building. ł asian computer monthly, published by computer publication, ltd. 8. journals, magazines, and newspapers in computers and electronics often cover news on china's computer science and technology. relevant items can routinely be found in publications such as electronic business, electronics weekly, computerworld, electronic news, computer weekly, electronics, minimicro systemł, coaputer data, and co!puting. 9. many american computer companies do business with china, and their marketing divisions can be very knowledgeable on china's computer industry. companies that have done substantial business with china include ibm, honeywell, wang, hewlettpackard, and sperry univac. a new bimonthly magazine, china computerworld, covers the people's republic of china's growing computer market. 10. more than 5000 chinese students and scholars are now in the united statesj it has been estimated that 10 to 15 percent of them specialize in computersciencerelated subjects. chinese delegationł also attend most of the major computer conferences abroad, although at this time only a small percentage of them deliver papers. 11. research organizations in foreign countries are still another source of information on chinese computer sciencea ł research policy institute on science and development in ł ł ł developing countries, university of lund, sweden. international development research centre, ottawa, canada ł organization for economic cooperation and development (oicd) centre, paris. science policy research unit, university of sussex, england ł unfortunately, these information sources have some serious 1 imi ta tiona a 1. none of the sources is specific enough to give details about china's computer technology and research. most results cited are too international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.55 superficial to be useful to a computer scientist who is interested in technical information. 2. chinese computer articles and technical reports are not being translated into english. only a small percentage of abstracts are being translated by jprs. in addition, the chinese almost never publish articles in foreign journals. 3. important computer conferences in china are not being reported. for example, the following two conferences held recently in china appear to have been significant, but we have little information about them: the national conference on exchange of minicomputer techniques was held in xi'an, shaanxi province, in november 1979. some 40 papers were delivered at the meeting, and more than 60 products were displayed, illustrating china's initial achievements in minicomputer circuitry. the national conference on integrated circuits and silicon materials was held during january 1980, in fuzhou, pujian province. some 500 scientists and specialists attended the conference, where 209 papers were read. the participants also discussed possible solutions to problems of low production, poor reliability, and high prices of china's integrated circuits. currently, china's computer industry is capable of producing a 5 million operation per second computer and 8bit singlechip microprocessors. it is estimated that they have about 2000 computers of more than 30 different types. if the current rate of growth continues, 5000 computers could be operational by the end of 1985. most large systems are imported: the two most popular domestic minicomputers are comparable to digital equipment corporation's pdp 11 and data general's nova. it is generally believed that china is about 10 years behind the united states in processing speed and semiconductor technology, and about 15 years behind in software and peripheral equipment. china is, however, making a concerted effort to catch up. at china's first national science conference, held in march 1978, computer science and technology was selected, along with other important areas such as energy and agriculture, to be one of the eight sectors that would receive china's major attention in the eightyear national plan for the development of science. in particular, the solution of scientific and technical problems in the production of largescale and very large scale integrated circuits is given heavy emphasis. the plan calls for china to turn out giant computers and build a fairsized modern computer industry by 1985. within the next several years, rapid advances are expected in research on computer science, including computer software and applied mathematics. the emphasis on catching up quickly in the computer field rather than on becoming profitable has meant that there are incentives for trying innovative schemes. in fact, it has been common among chinese universities and research institutions to build computers for their own use, resulting in many different types of computers. therefore there is a good chance that chinese computer scientists may discover and experience techniques that have not been tried in the united states. it is important for us to watch the developments closely, international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.56 perhaps by forming a chinese computer science clearinghoułe organization under the auspices of one of the organizationł mentioned above. such a clearinghouse could serve as a center for the collection and translation of detailed information on chinese computer science, and for the convenient dissemination of this information to u.s. coaputer scientists. the importance of creating such an organization will grow rapidly ał chinese computer scientists begin to catch up with the west. conclusions 1. interactions between chinese and american computer scientists are limited in number, involving sabbatical visits or excursiona. 2. the cultural revolution set back computer science in china from 10 to 20 years. 3. almost no scientific papers by chinese authors have appeared in publications outside of china. 4. chinese computer scientists are extensively studying foreign computer science, and u.s. literature is readily available to them. 5. chinese computer scientists are capable of doing original and firstrate work, as exemplified by studies on semantics and programaing languages. 6. the chinese have strong motivations to advance computer science because it can positively contribute to export and balance of trade. 7. considering the developments that have taken place in the lałt few years, china is expected to make significant progress in this decade. rbcommbndations 1. little of the current literature appears worthy of complete translation. 2. u.s. coaputer scientists should be kept informed by title or abstract about existing and future publications, whether in chinełe or english. 3. systematic publication of abstracts and reviews of chinese technical journals is recommended. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.chapter 6 the role of the international federation for information processing in information interchange in cciiputbr science the international federation for information processing (ifip) is an organization dedicated to the interchange of information among member countries in the general areas of data processing, informatics, and computer science. the membership of ifip includes countries from all five geographic areas examined in this report (the people's republic of china recently became a full member of ifip) ł the activities of ifip provide an important means for computer scientists in the united states to interact with their counterparts in other countries. as has been noted in other chapters of this report, the availability of englishlanguage material, though vitally necessary, is not by itself sufficient. a high level of direct interaction, including personal contacts, is important, particularly because the field is moving so rapidly that much published material is out of date when it finally appears in print, a phenomenon even more true for translated material. the scientific activities of ifip fall into three categories: 1. working group (wg) meetings. the working groups of ifip are small groups (10 to 30 members) of international experts in specific fields. for example, wg 2.1 is concerned with programming languages, and ng 2.3 with programming methodology. these groups hold semiannual or annual meetings in member countries, which are attended by members and possibly some observers. current work in progress is discussed. sometimes, but not always, the work lends itself to cooperative research projects, and those outputs may be released as ifip products. the wg membership elects new members on the basis of interest, geographical distribution, and demonstrated capability. since much of the work of the wgs is highly informal and interactive, no formal papers are given and no formal proceedings of wg meetings are published. 2. working conferences. working conferences, typically organized by one or more wgs, are small technical conferences on specific subjects. the attendance is by invitation only; the typical size is 100 attendees. formal papers are given, although intensive informal discussion is encouraged. proceedings of these conferences are published (usually entirely in english) by north bolland. 57 international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.58 3. ifip congresses. these large, open conferences, which take place every three years, are organized in a manner similar to the national computer conference (ncc) meetings in the united states. papers are solicited and refereed in the usual manner, there are many invited speakers to promote interest, and proceedings are published and widely available. ifip 1977 was held in toronto, ifip 1980 was held in japan and australia, and ifip 1983 will meet in paris. all ifip proceedings (both formal publications and informal discussion) are in english, thus there is no language barrier for u.s. participants. the united states currently has a fairly high level of participation in many ifip activities, yet its level of participation is below that of several european countries. continued and increased participation in ifip activities would be one effective way of providing opportunities for the direct personal contact that is necessary to the effort to make technical materials more accessible. in this respect, wg meetings are probably the most valuable form of contact. they affect a small but significant group of computer scientists. ifip congresses can potentially involve a much larger segment of the community, but like any large conference, they are less effective environments for the interchange of ideas. working conferences fall between these two extremes. the major need for support of ifip activities is travel funding for u.s. participants. several european countries, for example the federal republic of germany, provide funding in a special category for support of travel to ifip meetings. a relatively small expenditure can make a significant difference in levels of participation. in the united states, it is difficult to obtain funding for foreign travel in general. in some cases, eminent computer scientists have had considerable difficulty in obtaining nsf funding to attend wg meetings. in view of the importance of ifip activities in providing a vital forum for the interchange of ideas and for keeping u.s. computer scientists aware of activities in other countries, a significant increase in appropriate travel subsidies supporting ifip activities is strongly recommended. international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.chapter 7 summary, conclusions, and recommendations summary and conclusions computer science has emerged as a major international activity of considerable consequence. it is being supported extensively and intensively in all countries, whether undeveloped, underdeveloped, industrial, or postindustrial. electronic machines and systems are being applied pervasively to the solution of many problems. many believe that electronic systems can raise the productivity of our industrial work force to its uppermost limits while transforming society into a population of those who work with their minds. american computer scientists generally make good use of materials published in english but have difficulties keeping abreast of rapid advancements published in a foreign language, especially if that language is not part of our ethnic and cultural heritage. with computerized language translation still in its infancy and voice recognitionresponse systems barely off the drawing boards, existing language barriers between nations and scientists alike remain the most formidable obstacle to the free and effective exchange of ideas necessary to develop these technologies further. the panelists' five sets of conclusions, one set for each of the five geographical areas, are functionally dependent upon specific socioeconomic and linguistic constraints inherent in the five regions, and their recommendations are equally specific. yet these findings and suggested courses of action do contain some common threads, some fundamental principles. we have condensed these below into sets of general conclusions and general recommendations, but we suggest strongly that the reader pay heed to the more specific conclusions and recommendations contained in chapters 1 through 5. general conclusions 1. a considerable amount of information on worldwide computer science developments is available in documented form, but it is not always readily accessible to the u.s. computer science community. 2. personal contacts between u.s. and foreign computer scientists have created a powerful and effective international infrastructure 59 international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.60 within which research results are disseminated freely, albeit with saae delays. 3. monitoring of foreign computer science publications greatly enhances our understanding of foreign science policy and its implementation. 4. currently, translation into english often introduces serious delays before important developments abroad caae to the attention of scientists in the united states. s. several countries are in the process of emerging fraa their underdeveloped status, and we can expect their scientific prograas to accelerate markedly during the caaing decades. gbnbral recommendations 1. a second phase of the work of this panel should be begun. phase ii would be a pilot effort designed to show the feasibility and utility of its work, which could subsequently be taken over by an existing private organization, such as the american federation of information processing societies or the association for computing machinery. the plan for phase ii would be as followsa (a) through a limited number of carefully planned visits to countries where significant work is being done (primarily japan), panel members would obtain firsthand knowledge of research work in foreign universities and industrial laboratories. in addition to making and/or maintaining personal contacts, they could provide answers to such questions as thesea (1) is the best and most important work being published' if so, in what language? (2) what is the time lag between the coapletion of work and its publication? (3) is it feasible to establish channels of communication to get prepublication information? (b) a staff expert retained for the purpose would develop an annotated bibliography of published material annually, which would include a qualitative assessment of the material. this bibliography would provide the basis for a summary of major developments in computer science in the areas considered, which would be published annually. financial support fro. industry and/or government for saae aspects of this work will be essential. the panel should determine whether some existing publication is already filling this function. for example, obmsba publishing company, tokyo, is about to begin publishing łyearbooks, japan annual reviews in electronics, computers and telecommunicationsł in english. (c) the panel would investigate and make recommendations on whether centers of expertise for various overseas areas should be established. such centers might be established in the country of interest rather than in the united states. (d) the panel, together with a staff expert retained for the purpose, would select the best of the literature published in japanese in each year of the panel's work and translate it into international developments in computer science: a reportcopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.61 english. in addition, the panel would recommend a procedure for carrying out the necessary translations on a continuing basis. specific articles and books would be recommended as additional candidates for translation. the panel should identify strong researchers in japan and closely follow their research results and papers to determine still other candidates for tranłlation. the establishment and use of centralized data base systems to collect all the commercially and privately translated materials should be given high priority. {e) during the second year of ita activity, the panel would endeavor to negotiate an arrangement for some existing organization to continue the panel's work. 2. a funded program should be established under which select foreign publications with significant stature in computer science are abstracted in english, facilitating subsidized publication of titles, abstracts, and papers in a reputable u.s. journal. 3. a funded computer sciences foreign exchange program should be established to provide both language training and select work opportunities in the most advanced countries. 4. a policy position should be developed and a program funded, chartered to support senior computer scientists participating in select international activities of approved organizations such as the international federation for information processing (ipip) and the international council for computer communication (iccc). 5. guidelines and mechanisms should be developed to provide greater visibility for and improved accessibility to foreignlanguage computer science literature now abstracted or translated into english. international
