defense intelligence agency (dia) requested that the national research council (nrc)establish the committee on defense intelligence agency technology forecasts and reviews to conductmeetings with the intelligence community (ic) in order to develop study topics relating to technologywarning (see box es1 for the overall statement of task for this effort).the committee was asked to produce a report, based on its discussions with the intelligence community, that discusses capabilities upon which u.s. warfighters are dependent and to identify the potentialfor adversaries to threaten those capabilities through the exploitation of evolving technologies (seeboxes2 for the report statement of task).it is the intent of both the dia technology warning division as sponsor and the national researchcouncil that this first report, which is limited in scope, will establish the foundation for a longtermcollaborative relationship to support the examination of technology warning issues. it is expected thatsuch examination will be useful not only for the dia but also for other members of the intelligencecommunity who might need such analyses. it is intended that the current ad hoc committee be disbandedsubsequent to the publication of this report and that a standing committee be formed to work with the icto keep abreast of issues relating to technology warning and to develop specific statements of task forindependent ad hoc committees of the nrc to perform.scope and organization of the studyu.s. military strength is built on a foundation of technological superiority that grew from a positionof global leadership in relevant technologies and innovative capabilities. that leadership position is nolonger assured. the synergistic forces of globalization and commercialization of science and technologyare providing current and future adversaries with access to advanced technologies as well as the expertiseneeded to exploit those technologies.the ability of the u.s. intelligence apparatus to warn of evolving technologies that, in the hands ofadversaries, may threaten u.s. military preeminence is vital to the ability of the nations leadership tomake good decisions. the genesis of this report was the recognition by the dia technology warningavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

near and far term, toassist the agency to develop timelines, methodologies, and strategies for the application ofidentified technologies of interest to the defense intelligence agency (dia) under development within the united states and its allies and to bring to the agencyõs attention potentiallyuseful technologies that dia may not be aware of that might be of value for adaptation andconsideration.¥review information provided from government sources on technologies under developmentby other nations abroad and provide estimates on when these technologies may becomemature to the point they could pose a threat to u.s. forces.¥meet with the agency to discuss technology developments here and abroad of interest to diaand to develop potential study topics and task statements for indepth assessment of specifictechnical areas.¥provide one or two short reports during the course of the first year on subjects developed inthe course of meetings and as requested by the agency and approved by the nrc.box es2report statement of taskfor the first report, the national research council committee on defense intelligence agencytechnology forecasts and reviews will:¥develop, examine and review from unclassified sources evolving technologies that will becritical to successful u.s. warfighting capabilities.¥postulate methods for potential adversaries of the united states to disrupt these technologiesand discuss indicators for the intelligence community to investigate to determine if red forceelements are attempting to achieve this disruptive capability (this discussion should be generallyunclassified with specific sensitive or classified information, limited to secret, placed in anappendix).¥curtail its investigation to technologies consistent with the committee charter from the defenseintelligence agency threat analysis section (i.e., to exclude weapons of mass destruction(wmd) and areas of chemical/biological warfare not of specific interest to the sponsor).¥identify and recommend specific technology areas to be pursued in greater depth, both inspecificity and classification, in future reports requested by dia.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology

the nongovernmental scientific and technical communities.various lists exist that identify highimpact technologies projected to advance rapidly in the comingyears. virtually every such list contains some permutation of information technologies, biotechnologies,and nanotechnologies. from those lists it is relatively easy to identify a number of evolving technologieslikely to impact national security. it is more difficult to identify those specific technologies that arepotential gamechangers in the hands of enemies of the united states, and even harder to envisionpotential innovations that may derive from the integration of multidisciplinary technologies to yielddisruptive capabilities. these are the tasks levied on the technology warning community.owing to the studys time constraints, the technologies selected for inclusion in this report representa sampling derived from the collective experience of committee members rather than from a comprehensive survey. the committee made no effort to rationalize its selection from among the broad array ofevolving technologies of potential interest.therefore, rather than creating yet another list of potentially important technologies for the technology warning community to track, the committee chose to establish a framework that would enableongoing identification, assessment, and prioritization of emerging technologies in terms of their potentialimpact on u.s. military capabilities. it is hoped that the methodology presented as a prototype in thisreport will provide the foundation for the ongoing collaborative relationship envisioned by the diatechnology warning division.chapter 1 describes the challenges confronting the technology warning community, focusing on theimpact of globalization and commercialization of the technology marketplace.chapter 2 outlines the methodology proposed by the committee. this methodology is tested insubsequent chapters. to provide focus, the committees approach was anchored by the followingquestion: what capabilities does the united states have that, if threatened, impact u.s. military preeminence? subsequent steps in the methodology identify and assess emerging technologies and/orintegrated capabilities that, in the hands of u.s. adversaries, could be used to defeat that u.s. militarycapability. the basic methodology is summarized box es3.chapters 3 through 6 describe highlevel u.s. military capabilities and potential threats to thosecapabilities. the focus of chapter 3 is information superiority, which is identified in joint vision 2020as a vital enabling capability (jcs, 2000). in chapter 3, the committee identifies a number of genericvulnerabilities of informationtechnologyenabled systems and applications (including, in principle,those that might be used by blue (denoting u.s. military) forces to endeavor to maintain informationsuperiority). these generic vulnerabilities could be attacked via evolving technologies and methodologiesthat, in most cases, are increasingly available to u.s. adversaries in the form of lowcost, commercialcommodity products.the committee focused specifically on potential pathways for disruption, denial, or degradation ofcommunications and sensing capabilities. it considered system and/or network attacks as well as sensorattacks. the committee also identified, for each technology identified, potential observables that thetechnology warning community could use to analyze the intentions and/or capabilities of u.s. adversariesto employ these technologies and methodologies. additional background information relating to chapter 3 isprovided in appendix d.chapter 4 discusses air superiority, which underpins several of the joint vision 2020 operationalconcepts, with a focus on potential challenges in urban warfare. future threats to u.s. airpower in urbanwarfare owe much to two factorsthe trend toward globalization in aerospace and electronics, coupledwith what has been observed to be the best way to defeat u.s. airpower: that is, not necessarily the headtohead, platformtoplatform approach of the cold war, but rather the exploitation of asymmetries.avoiding surprise

u.s. airpower in the past has been the capabilities of its major platforms. these sophisticated platforms now require investments of tens of billions of dollars spread over decadesinvestmentlevels that few foes can match. however, the life of the advanced technology in these platforms can nowbe less than the development cycle. small, unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) offer a counter to largeplatforms; although they are much less capable than large platforms at the moment, they can have muchshorter and less costly development cycles. these factors contribute to the proliferation of such vehiclesaround the world, especially at the smaller sizes (munson, 1996).the committee describes a variety of technologies that may enable adversaries to diminish theadvantage currently held by u.s. airpower. the technologies are described in terms of the systemcharacteristics that they would provide. the characteristics considered include increased range and/orreduced signature; enhanced guidance, navigation, and/or targeting; enhanced lethality; and other techniques that directly counter u.s. capabilities.chapter 5 discusses challenges relating to the needed ability to discriminate between friends, foes,and neutrals, as well as among various targetskey capabilities for precision engagementand againavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.executive summary5focuses on the urban warfare environment. the committee addresses new technology developments thatmight assist enemy combatants by allowing their identity and that of innocent noncombatants to beintermixed. appropriate spoofing or other types of misidentification could cause the warfighter toengage a group of noncombatants, thus causing political and/or psychological damage to u.s. forces.the committee notes that u.s. leadership can no longer be assumed for a number of the technologiesdiscussed in chapter 5. japan, for example, is extremely strong in many areas of nanotechnology and inoptical and electronic devices. china is, in many cases (such as photonics), the country with the bestcombination of hightechnology manufacturing and design, and its expertise is increasingly employedby many hightechnology u.s. firms. europe has excellent research capabilities in the areas of semiconductor materials and devices; these can be and have been translated into startup corporations.as a result of this shift to offshore commercial vendors, important indicators of technologicaldevelopments are likely to appear in open source literature, including commercial internet sites, and atindustrial fairs, particularly in asia and europe. monitoring of key corporations is important. however,in many cases small or obscure startups are also of vital importance (suggesting that the tracking ofventure capital may offer yet another set of relevant observables). in certain cases, the observation ofcritical manufacturing items (raw materials and/or equipment) may be useful.chapter 6 describes a number of prospective capabilities related to biotechnology and focuses onpotential challenges to battle readiness and communications superiority. biotechnological capabilitiesare rapidly expanding and becoming more and more readily available to scientists throughout the world.emerging biotechnologies that may enable functional brain imaging, covert communications, the spreadof disabling infections, and sensor spoofing are likely to affect the conduct of military operations and thestatus of national security in the future, as highlighted in chapter 6.the neuroimaging techniques of electroencephalography (eeg), magnetoencephalography (meg),functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri), and nearinfrared spectroscopic imaging (nirs) providedirect measurement of brain function. the technology underlying these modalities is advancing rapidlyand will allow a multitude of measurements. this technology may in the future provide a better understanding of behavior, performance, readiness, and stress that is relevant to troop readiness, the understanding of cultural differences in motivation, and prisoner interrogation.there are many opportunities on the horizon for biology to play a role in covert communications.these include protein cube holography and bacteriorhodopsin solidstate devices for storing highdensity information, and deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) sequences as a medium for hiding covertmessages.although infectious diseases are a continuing concern, offer opportunities for a wide range ofgenetic modifications, and could be deployed in many different ways, they are not a primary focus ofthis report. lastly, the current emphasis on weapons of mass destruction has led to the development ofsophisticated sensors that, when activated, trigger responses that can be costly in time and can limittroop responses. a release of materials that trigger the sensors while not being actual threats is one wayof decreasing battle readiness in u.s. troops. the area of application of biotechnology to militarypurposes is currently wide ranging and will expand very rapidly over the next decade.chapter 7 provides general recommendations to the defense intelligence agency technologywarning division that stem from the evolving nature of the global science and technology environment.the chapter also offers suggestions relating to the envisioned ongoing collaboration with the nrc. thecommittees findings and recommendations are summarized below.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.6avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancessummary of findings and recommendationsneed for new collaboration and engagementfinding 1: there is a multitude of evolving technologies for which advances are being driven by thenongovernmental, global, scientific and technical communities.the information technology, biotechnology, microtechnology, and nanotechnology families willincreasingly provide foundational building blocks for militarily relevant capabilities for red (adversary) and blue (u.s.) forces alike. the fact that significant advances in these technologies will bedriven largely by commercial demandon a global scaleversus militaryspecific investment suggeststhe need for the technology warning community to establish a sustained relationship with the nongovernmental scientific and technical community in order to bolster its understanding and anticipationof technology trends.recommendation 1: the defense intelligence agency technology warning division, togetherwith the related intelligence community components that focus on technology warning, shouldestablish an ongoing collaborative relationship with the scientific and technical communities in theindustrial and academic sectors.the committee believes that the national academies, through the national research council,provide both a window into these communities and an appropriate institutional mechanism that couldassist in this endeavor.need for new indicatorsfinding 2: new intelligence indicators are likely to be needed to provide technology warning forthe diverse spectrum of evolving technologies that are being driven by commercial forces in theglobal marketplace.traditionally, the united states has assumed that it leads the world in science and technology. thisperspective leads the technology warning community to look for indications that external actors aretrying to catch up, or to exploit known technologies in new ways. projected future trends suggest thatit should no longer be automatically assumed that the united states will lead in all relevant technologies.this revised perspective imposes a new burden on the technology warning community, generating theneed for it to search in different places and in different ways to be able to warn against technologicalsurprise.recommendation 2: the defense intelligence agency technology warning division, in collaboration with the related intelligence community components that focus on technology warning,should establish, maintain, and systematically analyze a comprehensive array of indicators pertaining to globalization and commercialization of science and technology to complement and focusintelligence collection and analysis.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.executive summary7the committee believes that the observables identified in this report provide a useful baseline.however, it acknowledges that the first step in a more disciplined approach in technology warningshould be to decompose the broad trends into potential observables more systematically and then toevaluate the utility and applicability of analytic techniques for technology warning already in use inopen source intelligence analysis. the committee also acknowledges that since not all relevant advanceswill stem from the global commercial open source environment, such an approach should complementbut not supplant other collection techniques.need for framework methodologyfinding 3: the landscape of potentially important evolving technologies is both vast and diverse. adisciplined approach is thus needed to facilitate optimal allocation of the limited resources availableto the technology warning community.while it is relatively easy to create lists of technologies that will have military significance in thecoming years, it is harder to identify those specific technologies that are potential gamechangers in thehands of u.s. adversaries. the committee reviewed a diverse array of lists of technologieseachprioritized from a different perspective. some lists focus on potential disruptive technologies thatcould have catastrophic consequences in the hands of adversaries, while others focus on technologieswith significant commercial potential that may erode this nations technological edge. the committeebelieves that the technology warning community would benefit from a disciplined approach to theidentification and prioritization of the evolving technologies that may threaten u.s. militarypreeminence.recommendation 3: the defense intelligence agency technology warning division, in collaboration with the related intelligence community components that focus on technology warning,should adopt a capabilitiesbased framework within which to identify and assess potential technologybased threats.the committee believes that a capabilitiesbased methodology enables a systematic approach totechnology warning while reducing the tendency to focus only on advances in discrete technologies. themethodology presented as a prototype in this report was derived from the operational concepts andenablers described in joint vision 2020. it is offered as a starting point; the committee acknowledgesthat additional refinement is needed.in conclusionthe technology warning community, which plays a vital role in advising military leadership, isfacing unprecedented challenges. blue force strategies are increasingly dependent upon technologyenabled capabilities assembled from building block technologies in which u.s. technological leadershipis no longer assured. foreign governments and nonstate actors are gaining access to the same buildingblock technologiesoften via the commercial marketplace. the committee applauds the technologywarning divisions recognition that unprecedented challenges require new approaches and commendsthe efforts already underway.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.8avoiding surprise in an era of global

operation iraqi freedom, theu.s. populace is increasingly aware of the challenge of intelligence gathering, analysis, and forecasting.those involved with such activities, working for the most part anonymously, are performing a servicethat is critical to the continuance of this nationõs freedom. recent events clearly illustrate the need fortimely and accurate intelligence to aid tactical and operational planning for military operations as wellas to support planning efforts related to homeland security. in this report, the committee focuses on thestrategic issue of technology warning as it relates to military operations. because u.s. military strengthis built on a foundation of technological superiority, the ability of the u.s. intelligence apparatus to warnof evolving technologies that, in the hands of adversaries, may threaten u.s. military capabilities is vitalto the ability of the nationõs leadership to make informed decisions.during the cold war, the soviet union and its satellite nations were a central focus of the intelligencecommunity (ic). that era seems in retrospect to have been a much simpler time with respect to thedevelopment and application of technology to national security missions. the possibility of technologicalsurprise was always present, as evidenced by the soviet unionõs launch of sputnik in 1957, but stepfunctions in enemy warfighter capabilities were often anticipated in time to take countering steps.that is not to say there were not enormous technological advances during the postworld war ii era.significant developments during the past 50 years that had direct implications for national securityincluded stealth technology, improvement in target identification, precision weaponry, the informationtechnology revolution, and the birth of the internet. even though the ongoing information revolution isdriven primarily by the commercial marketplace and is global in scope, the u.s. military has to datesuccessfully maintained a technological edge over its adversaries.rather than dealing with the relatively monolithic threat posed by the former soviet union, theunited states now confronts a future of potential threats from many nationstates, as well as threats fromextra and transnational entities whose identities and allegiances are diffuse and complexñand whosetechnological prowess is enabled by globalization. these threats have also broadened in scope fromconventional military threats to those also endangering civilian populations and economic targets.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.10avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesthe effect on the intelligence community has been dramatic. not only must it deal with the complexity and diversity of these new threats, but it also must deal with a dynamic global environment interms of technology development and exploitation. u.s. technological leadership cannot be assumed inthe future.study originin full recognition of the reality that u.s. technological leadership can no longer be assumed, in thefall of 2003 the defense intelligence agency (dia) requested a series of meetings with nationalresearch council (nrc) staff members in the division on engineering and physical sciences todetermine if a relationship was possible that would provide access not only to members of the nationalacademies and the nonmember technical community but also to the research community throughout thenationõs universities and laboratories. the objective of the dia was not intelligence gathering per se,but rather the development of a new source of information on burgeoning technologies and theirpotential for òtechnology surprise,ó with attendant military ramifications. in particular, the technologywarning division of the dia recognized the potential value of ongoing engagement with the nationõstechnical communities in fulfilling its responsibility to òprovide the earliest possible warning of technological developments that could undermine u.s. military preeminenceó (dia, 2004).there were many issues to be overcome in order to establish the viable relationship that the diasought. the first concern of nrc staff members was security. it was assumed at the outset that much ofthe activity would necessarily be conducted at high levels of classification. the national academiesthrough the national research council can perform classified work and often does, but it is always thenrcõs objective to serve the public while conducting the work of the academies, and excessiveclassification can interfere with the openness sought. to the surprise of the committee chair and staff, ameeting with the director of the dia shortly after formation of the committee dispelled the notion thatthe committeeõs work would necessarily be classified. while some activities of the committee might beclassified, the director wanted the majority of the effort unclassified so as to facilitate sharing andcollaboration between the intelligence community and the scientific and technical communities.upon receipt of a contract, the current 1year ad hoc committeeñthe committee on defenseintelligence agency technology forecasts and reviewsñwas formed to conduct meetings with theintelligence community to study issues relating to technology warning. the committee was tasked toproduce a report that discusses capabilities upon which u.s. warfighters are dependent and to identifythe potential for adversaries to threaten those capabilities through the exploitation of evolving technologies. technologies to be considered were to include not only those emerging from researchestablishments, but also potential adversarial capabilities that could arise from innovative integration orthe application of existing technologies.it was recognized from the outset that the present report would be somewhat general in nature withrespect to the depth and breadth of technical analyses. it was the objective of both the dia and the nrcthat this first report would establish the foundation for a longterm relationship to support the examination of technology warning issues, not only for the dia but also for other members of the intelligencecommunity who might need such analyses. it is intended that the current ad hoc committee be disbandedsubsequent to the publication of this report and that a standing committee be formed to work with the icto keep abreast of issues relating to technology warning and to develop specific statements of task forindependent ad hoc committees of the nrc to perform.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

interconnectedness reflected in the expanded flows of information, technology, capital, goods,services, and people throughout the worldñas an overarching ômegatrend,õ a force so ubiquitous thatit will substantially shape all the other major trends in the world of 2020ó (nic, 2004). while globalization has been underway for several decades, its intensity and pervasiveness have now greatly increasedin magnitude and pace; the technology playing field is undergoing a massive change. technologyresearch and development (r&d), historically dominated by the united states, is increasingly distributed throughout the world. while the united states continued to lead the world in r&d spending in2002, according to data from the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd),1other nationsõ shares are changing dramatically as they seek to boost economic performance and enhanceglobal competitiveness. figure 11 illustrates the relative shares of r&d spending in 2002 (aaas,2004a).while the united states continues to dominate other nations of the world in terms of total r&dspending, comparisons of r&d spending as a ratio of gross domestic product (gdp) provide a differentpicture. the united states lags japan in total r&d as a percentage of gdp (2.67 percent versus 3.12percent in 2002) as well as in business r&d (1.87 percent versus 2.32 percent in 2002). between 1995and 2002, china doubled its spending on r&d when calculated as a percentage of gdp (1.2 percent in2002). during that same period, israel increased its spending from 2.74 percent to 4.72 percent of gdp,a ratio higher than that of any other oecd nation. many countries have set longterm, stable targets forincreasing r&d spending, with austria aiming for 2.5 percent of gdp by 2006, germany targeting 3percent by 2010, and the united kingdom targeting 2.5 percent by 2014. canada has set a goal of beingamong the top five investors in r&d among oecd countries, and korea has committed to doubling itsr&d investment between 2003 and 2007 (oecd, 2004b). these trends are indicative not only of thegrowing importance that nations are placing on r&d but also of prospective challenges to u.s. technological leadership. the longterm commitment of other countries to basic hightechnology researchfunding is particularly significant.additional indicators may be derived from the increasingly global distribution of science andengineering talent as nations increase the capacity and quality of their highereducation systems andentice their citizenry to stay home or to return from studies abroad to serve growing national economiesand research enterprises. in 1999, 13 nations (united kingdom, finland, south korea, japan, taiwan,norway, canada, sweden, netherlands, germany, ireland, france, spain) outranked the united statesin the ratio of first university degrees in the natural sciences and engineering to the 24yearold population, while in 1975 the united states ranked third (nsb, 2003).forces relating to globalization inevitably led u.s. corporations to outsource r&d in order to takeadvantage of the distributed expertise, but also to help gain entry to foreign markets. in particular, u.s.companies are leveraging research capabilities in countries such as israel, sweden, india, and taiwan(bromley, 2004). some u.s. companies take advantage of foreign research establishments, such as themotorola collaboration with the hong kong science and technology parks corporation.2 othersestablish their own research facilities, such as the microsoft research laboratories in beijing, china;1the oecd nations are australia, austria, belgium, canada, czech republic, denmark, finland, france, germany, greece,hungary, iceland, ireland, italy, japan, korea, luxembourg, mexico, netherlands, new zealand, norway, poland, portugal,slovak republic, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey, united kingdom, and united states.2see, for example,

february 11, 2005.funding to stimulate the development of such technologies.3 in other areas, such as information technologies, significant drivers stem from the commercial marketplace, which, as discussed above, isincreasingly global. the fact is that defense capabilities are increasingly dependent on innovationsdeveloped by commercial companies for the commercial market in many sectors, including telecommunications, aerospace, microelectronics, data processing, cryptography, special materials, biotechnology,and propulsion (dsb, 1999).what this shift means is that the u.s. defense establishment is no longer in the driverõs seat withregard to militarily relevant technological innovation. while u.s. technological advances in areas suchas stealth technologies and satellite imagery once afforded multidecade military advantage, the rapidpace of technological innovation driven by the global commercial marketplace is shifting the advantageto those who rapidly adopt, exploit, and integrate evolving technologies. while defensespecific investments will continue to spawn important technological advances, u.s. technological superiority is nolonger assured. small, researchseeded startups are of special importance in the generation of hightechnology ideas and products.a recent report published by the council on competitiveness observes the acceleration of technological innovation as measured by market penetration. òit took the automobile 100 years to penetrate50% of the global market. it took the telephone 75 years and electricity took 50 years. by comparison,the rise of cell phones, for example, has been nothing less than meteoricñfaster than the personalcomputerñfaster than the internetó (coc, 2004). the report further observes that the nature ofinnovation is changing, as postulated in table 12.table 12the nature of innovation is changingfromtoinventioninnovationlinear innovation modeldynamic innovation modebuild to forecasted demandsense and respond to

is driving technological innovation is provided infigure 12, which shows the relative contributions to r&d funding by the u.s. government and theprivate sector from 1953 through 2003. note that privatesector investment increased sharply during the1990s, while government funding remained relatively flat. while privatesector spending was at leastpartially driven by the boom in information technologies, the ratio between government and privateinvestments remains indicative of the trend toward technology commercialization. the profit motiveand the associated availability of large amounts of investment capital result in the rapid commercialization of new technologies that are perceived by investors to address unmet market needs. this leads to,among other things, a very short interval between the first appearance of an advancedtechnologyenabled operational capability and the time when it is a lowcost, widely available commodity. flatpanel displays are a recent example; cellular phones are another.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.technology warning15looking to the future, the information revolution continues to fuel the synergistic trends of globalization and commercialization of technologies. as observed in a recent nic report, òa nationõs level oftechnological achievement generally will be defined in terms of its investment in integrating andapplying the new, globally available technologiesñwhether the technologies are acquired through acountryõs own basic research or from technology leadersó (nic, 2004). thus, while patterns and trendsin r&d investments provide useful indicators of the distributed research talent, the globalization ofmanufacturing facilities may indicate an equally important trend in distributing systems integrationexpertise.the technology warning challengeit is relatively easy to create a list of technologies that will have military significance in the comingyears. it is far more difficult to identify those specific technologies that are potential ògamechangersó inthe hands of the nationõs enemies. and it is even more difficult to envision potential adversariesõinnovations that derive from multidisciplinary technology integration to yield disruptive capabilities.yet this is the task levied on the òtechnology warningó organizations of the intelligence community.the technology warning challenge is further complicated by the fact that adversaries are not necessarilybound by the legal, moral, and ethical standards that govern the u.s. development and application ofscience and technology. this is particularly true in some areas of biological and genetic research. òasdeoxyribonucleic acid (dna) manipulation becomes technologically and commercially viable, it hassignificant implications for both commercial and military uses that may not be pursued with equal fervorby all societies,ó as noted by brown (2003). it is arguably easier to be òsurprisedó by an adversary whois willing to employ technologybased capabilities that this nation would not consider using.a number of sources provide lists of technologies prioritized from different perspectives. some listsfocus on potential òdisruptiveó technologies that could have catastrophic consequences in the hands ofu.s. adversaries, while others focus on technologies with significant commercial potential that coulderode the u.s. technological edge. three families of technologies that appear in some form on virtuallyevery list are information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. the technology warningchallenge, however, is to characterize more specifically the applications of these technologies that mayjeopardize u.s. military advantage.the 2004 strategic planning guidance calls for the u.s. military to better prepare for a wide rangeof challenges, including òirregular, catastrophic and disruptive threats.ó potentially disruptive technologies include òbreakthroughs in sensors, information technology, biotechnology, miniaturization on themolecular level, and cyber operationsñcapabilities so spectacular they would quickly give an adversaryan edgeó (sherman, 2005). the threat of surprise due to disruptive technology, while not seen as a nearterm threat, is viewed as one to which the united states is most vulnerableñat least in part owing to thenationõs heavy reliance on technologybased military capabilities.a 2001 study sponsored by the central intelligence agency enlisted an external panel of expertsthat identified three tiers of technologies likely to impact national security by the 2015 time frame (otiia, 2001). candidate technologies included those shown in box 11. the definitions used by the panelare provided in appendix c. the firsttier technologies, those most likely in the panelõs view to have thegreatest impact, include gene therapy, wireless communications, image understanding, cloned or tailoredorganisms, microelectromechanical systems (mems), and nanotechnology. secondtier technologies,those seen as dependent upon particularly vigorous innovation, include optical communications,regenerative medicine, efficient software development, sensor webs, and advanced materials. the panelconcluded that thirdtier technologies are likely to remain just below the threshold of steady adoptionavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.16avoiding surprise in an era of global technology

alternativeenergy, distributed energy, newgeneration nuclear power plants, and fuel cells (oti ia, 2001).a recent national academy of engineering report (nae, 2004) identifies a list of òbreakthroughótechnologies and/or applications that engineers will be expected to contend with by 2020. the listincludes biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials science and photonics, information and communications technology, the information explosion, and logistics (nae, 2004). advances in nanotechnologywill be driven at least in part through government investment in the u.s. national nanotechnologyinitiative, which budgeted nearly $1 billion in research and funding for fiscal year 2004. strategicchallenges identified for the national nanotechnology initiative are shown in table 13.yet another perspective is provided by a webbased survey conducted by r&d magazine in whichreaders were asked to choose five technologies that are expected to see rapid growth and high investments in 2005 (studt, 2005). according to the survey, the top three technologies are fuel cells,nanotechnology, and antibioterrorism devices. more than 225 readers responded to the survey; in aseparate question, nearly 60 percent of the respondents revealed that they had some involvement in thetechnologies that they selected (studt, 2005).while derived from disparate sources, these lists of important technologies (as well as other listsshown to the committee) bear remarkable similarities in terms of the underlying technological foundations. so rather than creating yet another list of potentially important technologies for the technologywarning community to track, the committee chose to establish a framework that would lend itself to theongoing identification and prioritization of technologies in terms of their potential impact on the u.s.militaryõs operational capabilities. the committeeõs framework and methodology are discussed inchapter 2 of this report. chapters 3 through 6 contain the committeeõs initial assessments within specifictechnology areas, and chapter 7 provides general recommendations and suggestions for the path ahead.table 13challenges identified for the

this ad hoc committee, only three2day meetings were convened. this schedule provided limited time for committee members to developa common understanding of the dia technology warning divisionõs needs as well as to discern whatthe division already knows with respect to technologies of potential interest. thus, this report containssome òtutorialó information, as well as commentary, relating more specifically to the technology warning challenge.in addition, due to the limited time available for analysis, committee members tended to addresstechnologies with which they were personally familiar rather than attempting to rationalize selectionsfrom among the broad array of technologies of potential interest. this report therefore focuses on a fewspecific technologies and applications rather than attempting to provide a òcompleteó or prioritized listof important evolving technologies.furthermore, the technology warning division asked that the committee specifically excludetechnologies relating to adversarial threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, since that topic isoutside the divisionõs scope of responsibilities. it was acknowledged that such issues may be the subjectof future studies, but in this report the coverage is, as requested, only notional.it is the committeeõs intent that this report provide the framework and basis for an ongoing collaborative relationship between the intelligence communityõs technology warning community and thenational research council. committee members are, however, mindful of the caution expressed by theunited states commission on national security/21st century, which concluded that òu.s. intelligencewill face more challenging adversaries, and even excellent intelligence will not prevent all surprisesó(uscns,

assignment established, the committee turned its attention todefining a robust methodology for technology warning that would be suitable for the diverse inquirieslikely to stem from ongoing engagement between a standing committee of the national researchcouncil (nrc) and the intelligence communityõs (icõs) technology warning components. the proposedmethodology is described in this chapter and tested through application in subsequent chapters.key features of the methodologya robust methodology for technical inquiry should have four key features. first, to be accepted, itmust be presented in a lexicon and structure appropriate for the userõs cultureñin this case, for theculture in which the defense intelligence agency (dia) technology warning division (the sponsor ofthis study) operates. any communication of findings, conclusions, or recommendations offered by thecommittee must be expressed accordingly. the division makes use of weatherforecasting terminology(futures, watch, warning, alert)1 in the issuance of technology assessments, making the overall warningmessage regarding all products readily interpretable by any reader. the committee adopted and adaptedthe diaõs vocabulary to characterize the relative statusñand recommended actionñfor each technology.the second key feature is that, to be relevant, the study methodology must be tied in a fundamentalway to toplevel

technologies that could beused to deny a blue3 capability deemed critical to u.s. military success.the third key feature is that, to maintain focus and ensure timeliness, the study methodology mustyield assessments built on a solid understanding of the technical feasibility of potential technologybased threats. this requirement leads to a capabilitybased approach for investigating and categorizingcandidate technologies. furthermore, the technical peer review process to which all nrc reports aresubjected provides additional assurance of the technical quality of committee assessments.lastly, to be enduring, the methodology should accommodate evolving realities of science andtechnology (s&t) leadership, driven by the synergistic trends of globalization and commercializationdescribed in chapter 1. traditionally, the united states has assumed that it leads the world in s&t. thisperspective leads the technology warning community to look for indications that external actors aretrying to òcatch up,ó or to exploit known technologies in new ways. projected trends suggest that itshould no longer automatically be assumed that the united states will lead technological advances in allrelevant technologies. this reality imposes a new burden on the technology warning community, generating the need for it to search in different places and in different ways for the information needed to warnagainst technology surprise.foundation of the methodologythe committee believes that the technology warning division can most effectively prioritize itslimited resources by utilizing a capabilitiesbased approach with respect to assessing technologies. thelandscape of potentially important emerging technologies is both vast and diverse. ideally, the divisionshould assess whether a given technology has the potential to pose a viable threat prior to commissioning indepth analyses. since the division is keenly interested in when specific technologies may matureto the point that they pose a threat to u.s. forces, a functional decomposition from an adversarial, orred, perspective is most useful. the methodology defined by the committee begins with the followingfocus question: what capabilities does the united states have that, if threatened, impact u.s. militarypreeminence?in general, u.s. capabilities could be threatened either through direct denial of or disruption ofblue capabilities or via red capabilities that negate or significantly diminish the value of bluecapabilities (e.g., improvised explosive devices (ieds) being employed by insurgent forces in iraq).joint vision 2020 was used to define the basic framework for u.s. military capabilities deemed vitalto sustained success (jcs, 2000). the overarching focus of this vision is full spectrum dominanceñachieved through the interdependent application of four operational concepts (dominant maneuver,precision engagement, focused logistics, and full dimensional protection) and enabled through information superiority, as illustrated in figure 21 (jcs, 2000). the committee selected the four operationalconcepts, together with information superiority, as the foundation for its assessment methodology. jointvision 2020 provides the definitions presented in box 21.the committee also noted the importance of technology warning with respect to the òinnovationócomponent of joint vision 2020 shown in figure 21, since òleaders must assess the efficacy of newideas, the potential drawbacks to new concepts, the capabilities of potential adversaries, the costs versusbenefits of new technologies, and the organizational implications of new capabilitiesó (jcs, 2000).from this foundation the committee then identifies specific capabilities in accordance with the3òblueó is used in this report to denote u.s. military forces.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

preeminence?while the u.s. military has devoted significant time to the definition of vital capabilities in alignment with joint vision 2020, the committee made no effort in this first report to synchronize itsderivations or definitions, or to provide a complete decomposition of the operational concepts andenablers into their underlying capabilities. rather, committee members selected a few evolving technologies and assessed the potential for those technologies to threaten important u.s. capabilities. giventhat the committeeõs proposed basic methodology is adopted, future studies will analyze more comprehensively the threats to a taxonomy of u.s. military capabilities that derives from the operationalconcepts envisioned by joint vision 2020. the basic methodology developed by the committee issummarized in box 22 and is described in greater detail in subsequent sections.identifythe next step of the proposed assessment methodology is performed from the red perspective. thecentral question here is as follows: what are the evolving technologies that, in the hands of u.s.adversaries, might be used to threaten an important u.s. military capability? a corollary question is,what technologies, if rapidly exploited by the u.s. military, are likely to yield sustained technologicalsuperiority? however, this issue was addressed only peripherally, given the divisionõs focus on technology warning.having identified a technology of potential interest, the next challenge becomes the derivation ofòindicatorsó or òobservablesó that may suggest adversarial adoption or exploitation of that technology.figure 21 concepts constituting the basic framework for u.s. military capability as defined by joint vision2020.

from joint vision 2020 serving asfoundation for assessment methodologyinformation superiority is the capability to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while exploiting or denying an adversaryõs ability to do thesame. information superiority is achieved in a noncombat situation or one in which thereare no clearly defined adversaries when friendly forces have the information necessary toachieve operational objectives.dominant maneuver is the ability of joint forces to gain positional advantage with decisive speed and overwhelming operational tempo in the achievement of assigned militarytasks. widely dispersed joint air, land, sea, amphibious, special operations and spaceforces, capable of scaling and massing force or forces and the effects of fires as requiredfor either combat or noncombat operations, will secure advantage across the range ofmilitary operations through the application of information, deception, engagement, mobilityand countermobility capabilities.focused logistics is the ability to provide the joint force the right personnel, equipment,and supplies in the right place, at the right time, and in the right quantity, across the fullrange of military operations. this will be made possible through a realtime, webbasedinformation system providing total asset visibility as part of a common relevant operationalpicture, effectively linking the operator and logistician across services and support agencies.precision engagement is the ability of joint forces to locate, surveil, discern, and trackobjectives or targets; select, organize, and use the correct systems; generate desiredeffects; assess results; and reengage with decisive speed and overwhelming operationaltempo as required, throughout the full range of military operations.full dimensional protection is the ability of the joint force to protect its personnel andother assets required to decisively execute assigned tasks. full dimensional protection isachieved through the tailored selection and application of multilayered active and passivemeasures, within the domains of air, land, sea, space, and information across the rangeof military operations with an acceptable level of risk.source: jcs (2000).although targeted intelligencecollection methods remain important, in this report the committee focuses on observables that may be derived from open source analysisñleveraging the effects of theinformation revolution and acknowledging that the twin forces of globalization and commercializationprovide new sources of relevant information. at the same time, however, the committee recognizes thedifficulty of discerning when technological advances portend emerging threats rather than societalbenefits.a sample chartñchart

reserved.committee methodology25assessthe committeeõs assessment methodology involves characterization of a technology in terms ofthree variables: accessibility, maturity, and consequence. priorities for more detailed analyses mayderive from any individual variable or any combination of the three.accessibilitythe accessibility variable focuses on the question, how difficult would it be for an adversary toexploit the technology? it addresses the ability of an adversary to gain access to and exploit a giventechnology. this assessment is divided into three levels:¥level 1. the technology is available through the internet, being a commercial offtheshelf item;low sophistication is required to exploit it.¥level 2. the technology would require a small investment (hundreds of dollars to a few hundredthousand dollars) in facilities and/or expertise.¥level 3. the technology would require a major investment (millions to billions of dollars) infacilities and/or expertise.in general, level 1 technologies are those driven by the global commercial technology environment;they are available for exploitation by a diverse range of potential adversaries. level 3 technologies, bycontrast, are typically accessible only to statebased actors. the indicators likely to be of value indetermining an adversaryõs actual access to a given technology vary by level as well as by the type oftechnology.maturitythe maturity variable focuses on the question, how much is known about an adversaryõs intentionsto exploit the technology? it integrates what is known about an adversaryõs actions, together with anevaluation of the state of play with respect to the technology of interest. at the highest level, calledtechnology alert, an adversary has been identified and an operational capability has been observed. atthe lowest level, technology futures, the potential for a technologybased threat has been identified, butno positive indicators have been observed. the maturity assessment is divided into four categories: thefirst two (the lower levels) suggest further actions for the technology warning community; the other twoindicate the need for immediate attention by military leadership:¥futures. create a technology roadmap and forecast; identify potential observables to aid in thetracking of technological advances.¥technology watch. monitor (global) communications and publications for breakthroughs andintegrations.¥technology warning. positive observables indicate that a prototype has been achieved.¥technology alert. an adversary has been identified and operational capability is known to exist.given the potential for disruptive advances through technological breakthroughs or innovativeintegration, as well as the difficulty of identifying and tracking meaningful indicators, any particulartechnology is unlikely to progress sequentially through the various categories of maturity listed above.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.26avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesas indicated at the beginning of this chapter, the committee adopted and adapted the diaõs terminology in defining these categories. the definitions are likely to evolve as the process matures. thecommittee sees significant value in this basic approach, however, since it divorces the challenge oftechnology warning from the discrete time lines associated with òprediction,ó which are almost invariablyinaccurate.consequencecharacterization of a technology in terms of the consequence variable involves addressing thequestion, what is the impact on military capability should the technology be employed by an adversary?it involves assessing the impact of the postulated red technology on the capability of blue forces.this impact can range from denial or negation of a critical capability to the lessconsequential level ofannoyance or nuisance. a corollary assessment may be made as to the locus of impactñthat is, whetherthe technology affects a single person, as in the case of an assassination, or creates a circumstance ofmass casualty and attendant mass chaos.prioritizethe objective of the prioritization step of the methodology is to respond to the question, what arethe relative resources to be applied to each emerging technology to support the technology warningprocess? this step is intended to harmonize the distinct nodes of observed capability, demonstratedintent, resources available, and the inherent cost of inaction. prioritization is key to the technologywarning methodology, since the technology warning division lacks the resources to fully analyzeevery conceivable evolving technology. it is equally important to recognize that prioritization is anintegral part of each methodology parameter. the prioritization of individual parameters is based on thelevels of change detection and potential impact. by prioritizing the parameter, the division can focussubsequent analyses over a smaller subset of an assigned change detection domain. priority assignmentis essential to enable the focusing of more sophisticated informationgathering tools and analytic techniques on the areas of highest potential concern.the prioritization methodology lends itself to any number of commercially available tools andtechniques designed for assistance in establishing and maintaining a logical and consistent focus as wellas the flexibility to react to the dynamics of technology change and countryofinterest variability.during the prioritization process, it will be important to establish measures of performance to allowcritical analysis as well as change management in order to improve the overall process. the end result ofthe prioritization process is to provide for actionable awareness with which to influence analysis andtasking, the last of the methodology parameters.the committee envisions that prioritization would be accomplished in close consultation with thetechnology warning community. it made no attempt to further develop the prioritization process in thisreport.taskthe technology warning division will inevitably have unmet needs for additional information and/or intelligence relating to the prioritized list of evolving technologies. although some needs may be metthrough divisionchartered research, others will require the assistance of the broader intelligencecommunity.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all

subordinate agencies. suchrequirements must provide sufficient specificity to enable interpretation by collectors who are notnecessarily literate in the specific technology. the requirements may include general instructions foraccomplishing the mission. it is envisioned that some of the observables postulated in the identify stepof the methodology will provide a useful basis for such tasking.the results from collection efforts will be integrated back into the assessment step in order to refine,reprocess, and update the divisionõs understanding of a given technology. this analysis may stimulatethe issuance of a new report to the divisionõs customers to inform them of changes in the assessedmaturity of that technology.using the methodology in this reportto test the robustness of the proposed technology warning methodology, the committee applied it inorder to assess four key areas in this initial report. it should be noted that this initial exercise wasnecessarily circumscribed by the domain expertise represented in the committee members and by theshortness of time for broader outreach to the technical community at large. furthermore, since themethodology emerged in parallel with the committeeõs technology assessments, the approaches takenwere not entirely consistent.the foundation provided by joint vision 2020 and augmented by the military and professionalbackgrounds of committee members was used to select the following four key capabilities to assess:¥information superiority (chapter 3),¥air superiority (chapter 4),¥discrimination between friends/foes/neutrals (chapter 5), and¥battle readiness and communications superiority (chapter 6).chapters 3 through 6 each address the òidentifyó activity with examples of evolving technologiesthat may threaten the capability and potential indicators that such technology development is underway.the òassessó activity then examines opportunity and motivation for adversarial technology development and/or employment, posits change detection relative to the indicators, and assesses likely impact.preliminary characterizations of accessibility, maturity, and consequence are provided for most evolvingtechnologies, although the level of specificity is variable.subsequent steps (i.e., òprioritizeó and òtaskó) of the proposed methodology require customerinputs and actions and are left to future study efforts.referencejcs (joint chiefs of staff). 2000. joint vision 2020. director for strategic plans and policy, j5, strategy division. u.s.government printing office, washington, d.c.

information superioritythe importance of accurate, timely information in warfare is selfevident. the enormous advantagethat superior access to such information can provide to adversaries on either side of a conflict has beenrecognized by warfighters for thousands of years. the art of war by sun tzu says the following (giles,1910):all warfare is based on deception.attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it ismerely a question of instituting signs and signals.the quality of decision is like the welltimed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy itsvictim.though the enemy is stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. scheme so as to discoverhis plans and the likelihood of their success.hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he isnever at a loss.hence the saying: if you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if youknow heaven and know earth, you may make your victory complete.the vision of 21st century warfighting strategy, as articulated at the highest levels of u.s. militaryleadership, is critically dependent on the ability of blue forces to obtain and rapidly act on a highlyaccurate, detailed, and timely picture of the battlespace, and to deny red forces the ability to do so. injoint vision 2020, òinformation superiorityó is identified as a key enabler that cuts across all four of theavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.challenges to information superiority29envisioned operational concepts (jcs, 2000). that is, achieving information superiority enables blueforces to outmaneuver red forces (the dominant maneuver operational concept); to concentrate blueforces quickly and accurately on selected red targets (precision engagement); to react opportunistically to attack newly discovered, prospective red targets; and to rapidly repurpose resources (focusedlogistics) to protect blue forces from attacks by red forces (full dimensional protection).conversely, if an adversary can penetrate, infiltrate, contaminate, and/or neutralize the bluecommunications systems, computing systems, and/or the information that they contain, it can inflictserious damage on the blue force. this damage can range up to and including the defeat of the blueforce that otherwise would have prevailed. furthermore, the vulnerability of the blue force to significant reductions in its ability to operate effectivelyñas a result of disruptions in its ability to communicate and access information securely and in a timely mannerñincreases as the blue force implementsnew or significantly modified concepts of operation that increasingly depend on information superiority.maintaining information superiority in the face of globalizationand commercializationthe information technology revolution is on par with the industrial revolution in terms of bringingin new and disruptive technologies that drive societal change through their ubiquity and pervasiveness.since computing and communications go hand in hand, this confluence of technologies is often referredto as c&c.1a current c&c vision would almost certainly include sensors (i.e., computing, communications,and sensors) because many existing and emerging commercial and military applications are criticallydependent for their success and value on the availability of sensors that generate information needed forsituational awareness. see, for example, the recent coverage in the popular press and in investmentpublications regarding the many applications of networked radio frequency identification (rfid) tags.the industrial revolution began in the united kingdom and germany and gradually spread to therest of the world. in contrast, the c&c revolution has taken root throughout vast areas of the world, anda number of the newest technologies of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s are commodity technologies oftoday. examples that quickly come to mind are highperformance personal computers, personal digitalassistants, twoway pagers, videocameraenabled cellular telephones, virtualrealitybased multiplayergames, and highbandwidth networking. the vast majority of these devices and systems were developedin the united states initially, under sponsorship of the department of defense (dod) (largely thedefense advanced research projects agency [darpa]). they then were sponsored through crossagency presidential initiatives on high performance computing and communications (now havingbecome the national coordination office for information technology research and development).it is not difficult to see that a variety of benefits resulted from the strategy of using national securityòsurprise preventionó priorities to seed and then nurture the c&c engine of economic productivity andgrowth in the late 1990s and early 21st century. the benefits include the following:¥the level of current superiority in u.s. military systems incorporating information technology,¥a very high societal return on investment (i.e., well beyond the domain of defense applications), and¥a vibrant commercial sector, which can deliver systems to the dod as commercial offtheshelf(cots) products (and integrations thereof); these are much less expensive than traditional, one1see, for example,

the norm in dodprocurements of platforms and systems.as a result of these successes, this strategy has been studied by several foreign governments and isbeing emulated by the european union nations and by singapore, china, and other nations. additionally,while the virtues of cots over gots products are indisputable and numerous, a byproduct of theòseeding and nurturingó strategy to date has been the acceleration of the commoditization of c&ctechnologies.a national response to these developments to date could fall into one of two categories:1.an added emphasis on a classification regimen to protect the newest advances in c&c and areturn to a more traditional model of development favored in earlier generations of dod procurement of platforms and systems. (it is unlikely that such a strategy would succeed in slowing downthe commercial emergence significantly, if at all, of many of the enabling technologies overwhich the dod might wish to keep control.)2.a recognition that, while the constituent technologies comprising c&c have been commoditized,their integration into complex, secure, useful, usable, survivable systems that benefit the dodcan indeed be a competitive advantage if the nation maintains sufficient leadership in the relevantsystems integration skills.other nations as well have recognized the advantages of a strong research enterprise. a number aredevoting increasing fractions of their national resources to basic and early applied research in manyemerging areas, while the united states is at best maintaining a steady level of funding for its researchagenda (although the amount of funding is still quite large in absolute, inflationadjusted dollars) (rocoet al., 1999; chan et al., 2004). the end result is that the united states can be assured of neither the firstand the best technology results nor a first moverõs advantage in applying cots to military systems.this situation compounds the difficulties faced by the technology warning community. that is, notbeing in a leadership position in creating and applying the technology makes it much harder to knowwhat to look for and more difficult to understand the implications of the complex array of thingsobserved.with this background, chapter 3 focuses on providing the beginnings of a roadmap to help thetechnology warning community identify, analyze, and prioritize developments in the internationalexploitation of c&c technologies in several key areas. these areas are trusted software; trusted hardware and foundries; supercomputing; ubiquitous sensing, computing, and communications systems; andthe fusion of c&c with other novel technologies.trusted softwaresoftware today plays the role of a universal system. the key to achieving the marriage of ònew andoldeconomyó technologies is the development of new softwarebased technologies for the integrationof complex systems. the competitor who is more adept at designing, implementing, and operating large,complex, softwarebased systems will be at a distinct advantage in 21stcentury operations that areincreasingly dependent on information superiority. these systems of course need to be secure andtrustworthy (i.e., they need to do what is expected and only what is expected).one often hears a somewhatundeserved comment about the state of current software development(particularly in the context of large, softwarebased systems): that is, current software is just pooravoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.challenges to information superiority31enough to slow down the impressive gains made to date in computer hardwareñpoor enough to keepthe performance improvement of systems modest. there are numerous examples of cost overrunscaused by failed projects involving softwarebased system development (especially embedded software)in procurements. these examples include the crusader artillery system, the comanche helicopter, thespacebased infrared systemhigh satellite, the f/a22 airplane, the future combat system, andunmanned combat aerial vehicles (the joint unmanned combat aerial system). this phenomenon is notexclusively a management problem.competent program managers with experience in large, softwarebased system development are inshort supply and high demand. their needed multidisciplinary skills are largely honed through ontheproject experience, and they are subject to the natural selection processes of a competitive businessenvironment. they cannot be easily òclonedó through educational programs.with the growth of large softwaredevelopment centers in india, israel, and eastern europe, thetechnology warning community should be carefully tracking the work on techniques for the development of trusted software systems, especially trusted embedded software systems. new techniques forthe metamodeling of embedded systems, aspectbased programming, and modelbased integration ofembedded systems should be closely monitored.a related point is the need for new methods for the development of trusted software for civilianinfrastructures. the huge market created by the expanding use of wireless embedded systems in physicalinfrastructures, and the associated commercial requirements for the trustworthiness of those systems,afford the possibility of generating a cyber infrastructure that is secure and trustedñand availableworldwide to allies and adversaries alike.trusted hardware and foundriesblue force technological superiority relies on the development and manufacturing of trusted and,it is hoped, tamperproof hardware components. therefore, it is important to pay attention to trends insemiconductor manufacturing to determine the relative maturity and directions of u.s. and foreignsemiconductor fabrication facilities. to date, the united states remains the world leader in processorfabrication and in the production of applicationspecific integrated circuits (asics). however, emergingfoundries in south korea, taiwan, and china are poised to take a leading market share in semiconductors.additionally, technology trends point to the emergence of a number of interesting new nanotechnologies and materials that will be used alongside complementary metaloxide semiconductor(cmos) technologies and methods. while cmos is the dominant electronics technology of today,alternativesñnanotubes (e.g., carbon and silicon), molecular electronics, quantum dots, and othersñare rapidly being developed. eventually they are likely to complement and perhaps even supplantcmos as the electronics benchmark. it will be important to monitor, with a worldwide perspective, thedevelopment of these electronics technologies (dsb, 2005).supercomputingthe greatest supercomputing threat today does not come from fourthgeneration computers butrather from the use of grid computing involving the concept of ònetworks of workstationsó to connectcommodity personal computers (pcs).2 such grid computing is already being used by the search for2see, for example, http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/ and

computing. highperformance scientific computingis an important dualuse technology with diverse applications, including cryptology, signal processingand climatic modeling, geological event detection, and intracellular and intercellular interaction modeling (socalled systems biology). the network of workstations is a commodity entity, but the distributedsoftware is the key element of differentiation.ubiquitous sensing, computing, and communications systemswith the convergence of computing and communications technologies, there is now an emergenceof sensor webs of smart dust, networks of cameras, networks of unmanned òxó vehicles (uxvs),networks of microsatellites, and other networked embedded systems. the sensing, computing, andcommunications hardware that goes into these systems is commodity. however, the exploitation ofdistributed sensor networks for applications ranging from civilian infrastructure to intelligencegatheringactivities in a secure and trusted fashion is once again conditioned on the use of superior techniques forembedded software development for networked embedded systems. thus, from a technology warningperspective, the investment in systems building for secure cyber infrastructures and other networkedembedded systems is an important arena for identification, assessment, and prioritization. more detailedinformation on ubiquitous sensing, computing, and communications systems is provided in appendix din this report.fusion of computing and communications with other novel technologiesc&c has been the paradigmshifting informationtechnologybased engine of change over the past30 years. all indications are that in the future it will, for many applications of great importance to thedod, be leveraged via a fusion of c&c with biotechnologies, information technologies, and nanotechnologies in such a way that the best of the potential capabilities of nano and biotechnologies areharvested on a c&c substrate. an example of how c&c technologies in ubiquitous sensing andcommunications systems can be combined with other technologies addressed in this report is the use ofvideoenabled disposable cellular phones in microair vehicles to provide networked monitoring andsurveillance.3 another example is the use of c&c technologies with dna computing methods toproduce synthetic biological systems.4potential observables that may indicate emerging threatsmany of the technologies that pose potential threats to the communications capabilities of blueforces are readily available in the global marketplace. thus, it is possible to postulate a variety of otherobservables that may be of value. table 31 summarizes potential observables and potential sources ofinformation for each. for example, the areas that foreign graduate students choose to study may be anindicator of the desire of a foreign government to develop capabilities in that area. in retrospect, it is3for additional information, see, for

of engineering, particularly nuclear engineering, was an indicator of a desire to develop a nuclear capability.another indicator of emerging or existing capability is the return of foreign expatriates to theircountry of origin. in many cases their return could simply evidence a desire for wealth in a rapidlygrowing market and would be considered a natural byproduct of the global economy. however, thereturn of foreign expatriates could also indicate that desired information had been obtained in the unitedstates and could now be put to use by foreign entities.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.34avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesanother indicator that should be watched is an increased interest in lowpower electronics. suchinterest could be indicative of developments in the areas of sensors and sensor networks. similarly, anincreased interest in lowpower radiofrequency communication may be indicative of developments insensor networks. since much of the expertise for sensor networks is the same as that for mobiletelephone networks, this behavior may also simply be a natural outgrowth of the increasingly ubiquitoustelecommunications environment. the committee believes that it nonetheless bears attention.advances in cryptography and computer security often appear in the open literature. increasingly,these advances are the work of foreign researchers. recently a french researcher broke sha (securehash algorithm)0 (replaced by sha1 in 1994), and chinese researchers have broken messagedigestalgorithm 5 (md5) (randall and szydio, 2004; wang et al., 2004). israeli researchers have successfullyattacked a 40round version of sha1. sha1 is the foundation of many security protocols. the nationalinstitute of standards and technology believes that sha1 remains secure, but has decided to phase itout in favor of hash functions that it believes are stronger, such as sha256 and sha512 (nist, 2002).it is difficult to gauge the strength of government efforts in cryptography and computer securitysince the results are unlikely to be published in the open literature. the analysis of such activities islikely to have to rely more on targeted intelligence collection. a possible indicator is that of hiringpatterns of foreign intelligence agencies. the hiring of mathematicians and computer scientists could bea strong indicator that such agencies are developing a capability in cryptography or computer andcommunications security.an indicator that is often missed is silence. during world war ii, leading nuclear physicistsprevailed on their colleagues and scholarly journals to refrain from publishing their results. this wasinterpreted correctly by the soviets to signify that work of consequence was occurring, since it was veryunlikely that the leading physicists of the day would simply stop publishing. if it was noticed that foreignresearchers who had been publishing in, say, cryptography suddenly stopped or switched areas, it would bea strong indicator that increased attention should be paid to activities in that area by that government.areas of industrial investment can also be indicators. anecdotal discussions indicate that cisco nowconsiders huawei technologies, based in shenzhen, china, to be its greatest competitor. according toa recent news article (the economist, 2005), huawei, chinaõs leading telecommunications equipmentmanufacturer, now ranks 8th among wirelineequipment suppliers, up from 18th last year (cisco ranksfirst). former peopleõs liberation army (pla) officer ren zengfei heads huawei technologies. huaweiis of particular interest because approximately 40 percent of its employees are in research and development, which contrasts sharply with current commercial practice in the united states.5earlier in this chapter it was observed that silence may also be a useful observable. with that idea inmind, some of the areas identified in table 31 (e.g., publications and patents) should be monitored forabrupt pattern changes. a cautionary note with respect to the observables postulated above is that thecommittee made no assessment regarding policy or other issues that may limit such analysis. furthermore, the committee acknowledges that many of the observables that it identified may be routinelyanalyzed by the technology warning community.basic ways to degrade or neutralize information superiorityan adversary could impact blue force information superiority in a number of ways, includingexploitation, corruption, disruption, or destruction of u.s. information systems. virtually any component5see, for example, http://company.monster.com/huaweihk/. last accessed on february 11,

potential targetñthat is, the aggregate of individuals, organizations,and systems that collect, process, and disseminate information, including the information itself (jcs,2000). in this section, the committee provides a òtutorialleveló overview of several of the morecommonly used methods of attack.exploitationif an adversary gains access to protected information, the system has been exploited. interceptingbattle plans and moving assets out of harmõs way are perhaps the most classic examples of battlefieldinformation exploitation. most commonly, exploitation is associated with voice or data transmissionamong forces or between forces and command authorities. in the modern battle environment, however,other information can be exploited. intercepting the communications between a sensor and the nextpoint in the communications stream, or between a weapon and its launch platform, are examples ofmodern exploitation. intercepting a wireless or wired signal, òbuggingó a node or facility in the system,or emplacing a human agent are all methods of information exploitation.encryption is perhaps the most effective way to prevent the loss of information through signalinterception. òbuggingó may be prevented (or detected) by the application of suitable scanning technology, but doing so may be expensive and tedious. the òspy,ó especially an insider threat, may be themost difficult to counter. history is replete with stories from classical times to the present of spiesupsetting even the bestlaid battle plans.corruptionif an adversary gains access to the information environment and is able to alter information, thatinformation has been corrupted. means of corrupting information are manyñranging from òspoofing,ówhich means changing the content of information collected and transmitted, to deception, which issimply creating bad information. being able to flip 1õs and 0õs in a data stream so that a weapon hits awrong target is an example of spoofing. passing on false information so that a wrong target is attackedconstitutes deception.the level of maturity of technology required to spoof electronic information is relatively advanced,probably beyond the inherent capability of an insurgent but well within the capability of a state actor.however, insurgents with sufficient money could buy the technology and the capability to use it on theblack market or from some lessthanscrupulous state actors. one must have the means to intercept,alter, and then retransmit information, or one must be able to compromise a sensor or to compromisedataprocessing or datatransmitting hardware. deception, especially involving human sources, isnotoriously easy.using encryption to ensure the integrity of data that are transmitted is a wellknown technique thatshould be implemented. it is extremely difficult for even a peer adversary to alter the contents of anencrypted data stream in an undetectable fashion. it is much easier to alter the data at the source beforeit is encrypted (e.g., altering the values returned by a sensor).disruptionpreventing the movement of information constitutes a disruption. the jamming of a signal, eitherwired or wireless, is an example; the flooding of communications channels with extraneous messagescould also disrupt the movement of useful information; cutting a communications link is anotheravoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.36avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesexample. the destruction of a single node on a system may disrupt the functioning of the system,although it would not destroy the system itself. for example, blowing up a communications tower orshooting down an unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) could be disruptive of the entire system withoutdestroying it.state actors, whether through indigenous or purchased capability, are the adversaries most likely toacquire weapons to jam u.s. systems. in the early days of operation iraqi freedom, iraq attempted touse purchased global positioning system (gps) jammers to interfere with gps precisionguided munitions of the united states (trimble, 2003).destructiontaking down an entire information system for an extended period of time effectively constitutes thedestruction of that system. the most extreme example would be through the use of an electromagneticpulse (emp) system (foster et al., 2004). potential adversaries have no doubt watched u.s. methodologyin iraq and elsewhere and realize that such a strike might gravely damage this nationõs ability to wagewarfare.only a major state actor would be capable of such a strike today over an entire theater. however,lesser state actors and insurgents might, with a lucky hit, be able to destroy a major command center andsignificantly interfere with the u.s. ability to conduct operations. one major threat from a nuclearcapable, lesser state actor would be to detonate a weapon at high altitude; the resulting emp might welldestroy the electronics in ground assets as well as nearby space assets. if the attacker were so fortunateas to òpumpó the van allen belts, the number of space assets at risk would rise dramatically (foster etal., 2004).analogies in nonwarfighting scenariosthe blue forceõs increasing dependence on information superiority has related analogies in nonwarfighting scenarios. new and emerging information technologies and their associated applications arerecognized as being the engine of productivity growth in developed countries. conversely, the disruption of widely used services and applications that employ information technologies can have widespreadand major consequences. for example, disrupting the capabilities of average u.s. citizens to send andreceive email, to make and receive cellular telephone calls, and/or to access web sites causes a majordisruption in their abilities to do their jobs effectively and to conduct their personal business effectively.this is the case today even though email, cellular telephones, and the world wide web were not usedby average citizens only 15 years ago. businesses and individuals will become increasingly dependenton applications of information technology that employ sensors (gps receivers, rfid tags, and so on).given that dependence, even perceived disruption (e.g., spoofing) could diminish usersõ confidence inthe underlying information networks and, in effect, degrade the services that the networks wouldotherwise deliver.committee focus: communications and sensing systemsjoint vision 2020 acknowledges the transitory nature of information superiority as well as the factthat it alone does not guarantee victory (jcs, 2000). rather, information superiority serves as anessential enabler for the operational concepts. in general terms, a distributed blue force needs thefollowing:avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.challenges to information superiority37¥to know where it is (information about the locations of relevant blue forces);¥to know where the adversary is (information about the locations of relevant red forces andred systems, which will often be obtained from distributed, networked blue sensors);¥to decide where it wants to be at specific times in the future;¥to know how to safely get where it wants to be (using networked blue sensors to detect threats);¥to know what to do when it gets there;¥to respond to emerging opportunities and threats (which will often be detected by networkedblue sensors); and¥to be able to do so more quickly and more effectively than the adversary.the ability to communicate over distance with low latency relies on superb communications andrapid, controlled accessibility to relevant information, which are core capabilities of any modern fighting force (mitre, 2004). such capabilities become increasingly important as the military movestoward implementation of the operational concepts articulated in joint vision 2020. the recognition ofthe importance of these capabilities has led to programs such as the joint tactical radio system, whichseeks to rationalize the disparate communications systems of the armed forces under a standard,interoperable architecture. the importance of such efforts is underscored in programs such as the futurecombat system, which relies on excellent communications and the superb (but controlled) accessibilityof relevant information in order to achieve unprecedented situational awareness, coordination, andreaction times. if the abilities of the soldiers and other systems to communicate reliably and/or to accessdependable information are substantially disrupted, the effectiveness of the forces that rely on information superiority to accomplish their missions will be substantially reduced.potential pathways for disruption, denial, or degradation ofcommunications and sensing capabilitiesas a result of the highly distributed nature of communications systems, the interdependenciesinherent to network architectures, and the fact that blue forces increasingly rely on commerciallyavailable technologies, innumerable vulnerabilities exist (many of them are well documented in openliterature). below, the committee summarizes some potential pathways that could impact the nationõsability to maintain information superiority. these pathways include the following:¥causing physical damage to wireless handheld appliances and using embedded wireless subsystems to destroy or degrade the ability of blue forces to communicate (e.g., using empgenerators to destroy electronic components or to cause significant changes in stored data);¥jamming of communications capabilities (e.g., using strong radio signals to overload the wirelessreceivers in wireless systems and subsystems);¥performing a denialofservice attack on communications capabilities by overloading networkswith bogus communications (e.g., injecting packets into a network to cause congestion, preventing blue force packets from reaching their destinations);¥performing a denialofservice attack by revoking the access privileges of legitimate users andsystems (e.g., by attacking the authentication databases, making it impossible for legitimatesoldiers to authenticate themselves to systems that they wish to access);¥disrupting network servers so the information that they contain is not accessible to legitimateusers of those servers (e.g., by overloading the servers with bogus requests for information, as ina distributed denialofservice attack on a commercial web server);avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.38avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advances¥accessing information that should not be available to the party accessing it (e.g., using a spy withaccess privileges to obtain informationña form of òinsideró attack);¥breaking cryptographic systems to read encrypted messages in transit, to read encrypted storedfiles, or to obtain passwords and cryptographic keys;¥spoofing sensorsñthat is, causing false readings, resulting in misinformation that causes theblue forces to misinterpret situations in which accurate situational information is critical (e.g.,causing a sensor to mistakenly identify noncombatants as red forces);¥evading sensor detection (stealth) by employing technologies that mask the physical attributesthat are being sensed (e.g., clothing that employs a combination of insulation and surface coolingto evade detection by infrared sensors); and¥jamming sensorsñthat is, employing òsignalsó that overload sensors and/or prevent sensorsfrom discriminating between ònoiseó and signals of significance (e.g., attempting to overload ordamage acoustic sensors with inexpensive, highpower acoustic noise generators).identification and assessment steps of thecommittee methodologya variety of technologies and tactics may be employed to degrade the information superiority ofblue forces. several techniques were discussed in the previous section. here the committee identifiesa few specific technologies and postulates observables that may suggest adversarial intent to developsuch capabilities. two broad categories are considered: system/network attacks and sensor attacks.system/network attackselectromagnetic pulse generatorsthe combination of a sufficiently high energy electromagnetic pulse (emp) generator with a suitable antenna could be used by an adversary to achieve a disruptive capability (see charts 31 and 32).technologyobservableselectromagnetic pulse(emp) generators:nonnuclear, transportable generators ofelectromagnetic pulses that are

advancesmalicious codesmall groups of talented computer scientists can produce potent malicious code. the insertion ofundetectable malicious code into wellprotected military systems may require access to the systems bypersons with system administration privileges. however, this could also be accomplished by adversariesemployed by softwaredevelopment organizations that develop the software used by blue forces. theactivation of the malicious code by an adversary during an actual operation would probably require theadversary to employ blue force insiders with sufficient access privileges (see chart 35).sensor attackssensor attacks can generally be classified into jamming (overloading the sensory input to degradethe sensor system either temporarily or permanently), signature reduction (camouflage), and spoofing(injecting false signals into the sensor stream either at the sensor or at the network or computation orcommunication level). while any of these tactics can be effective in specific instances, there is a generalhierarchy of impact. while jamming can deny the blue forces the use of their sensors, it leaves nodoubt that the red forces are making an assault on the sensor suite, and tracing the source of thejamming leaves red forces vulnerable to counterattack. signaturereduction strategies degrade situational awareness without providing an obvious indication of enemy presence or providing any directionsfor response. spoofing can degrade blue force capabilities by diverting resources into unproductivedirections.blue forces exploit a diverse and expanding spectrum of sensor modalities, as illustrated in table 32.additional related information is provided in appendix d in this report. it should be noted, however,that the information in this report is not comprehensive in terms of either modalities or their potentialapplications.technologyobservablesmalicious code (e.g., executable softwarehidden within an application loaded onto ablue system) that

additional information on sensor modalities.sensor attacks are typically targeted to specific sensor modalities. here the committee has notprovided a complete assessment, instead discussing only general approaches that may threaten bluesensor suites, together with potential observables. a discussion of a few specific technologies is provided in subsequent chapters (e.g., see the subsection entitled òsensor spoofingó in chapter 5).jammingin general, sensors are designed to detect weak signals and to filter out extraneous signals withoutdegrading the signals of interest. in most cases, radiofrequency (rf), terahertz (thz), infrared (ir)radiation, optical, ultraviolet (uv), acoustic, chemical, and biological detectors can be readily overwhelmed by the deliberate introduction of large levels of artificial signals into the theater of operations.undoubtedly the best defense is redundancyñof sensors and of sensing modalities. reliance on a singlesensor of a single observable is an inherently risky strategy that allows an adversary to exploit a singleset of vulnerabilities. hardening of single sensors is usually expensive and most often degrades thesensitivity and/or selectivity of the sensor. distribution of widearea networked sensors operating acrossa range of modalities provides an inherent immunity (see chart 36).capabilitypotential observablessensor jammingin some cases, such as infraredcountermeasures for heatseeking missiles,there are national programs to developappropriate sources and packaging. clearly,these need to be monitored. more difficult todetect are strategies that employ lowtechnology sources, e.g., acousticgenerators, to confuse appropriate sensors.on the state level, both the jamming sourcesand the hardening of each stateõs ownsensor suite provide potential observables.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.42avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescamouflagesignature reduction is a timehonored military tradition. one specific area of great importance is thereduction of infrared signaturesñattempting to reduce the benefit of ir sensors to blue forces. thereis a long history of signal manipulation and reduction by using advanced coatings (e.g., stealth), improvedthermal isolation, and so on. recently, there has been much activity reported in the open scientificliterature in the related fields of photonic crystals, plasmonics, and metamaterials. while the goals aremany and span the range from fundamental optical interactions with matter, to improved telecommunications and signal processing systems, to quasioptical interconnects in nextgeneration integratedcircuits, all of these areas have a potential impact on infrared signatures and sensing (see chart 37).spoofingthere are as many possible targets for the use of spoofing as there are sensors. one category ofincreasing importance is chemical and biological sensors. ground forces are significantly hampered byprotective gear to defend them against these threats. thus, red forces gain significant leverage ifblue forces must defend against a threat that does not exist while red forces can operate unencumbered (see chart 38).summaryin joint vision 2020, information superiority is identified as a key enabler that cuts across all fourof the envisioned operational concepts (jcs, 2000). in the future, the united states can be assuredneither of being the first to have access to all of the best information technologies nor of having a firstmoverõs advantage in applying cots products to military systems. as a result, it is much harder toknow what to look for and much more difficult to recognize the implications of the complex array ofachievements in information technology and undertakings in development and applications that will bepossible to observe.the committee identified a number of generic vulnerabilities of informationtechnologyenabledsystems and applications (including, in principle, those that might be used by blue forces to endeavorto maintain information superiority). these vulnerabilities could be attacked via emerging technologiesand capabilities that, in most cases, are increasingly available to u.s. adversaries in the form of lowcost, commercial commodity products. the emerging technologies and capabilities that might attackthese vulnerabilities include (but are not limited to) the following:¥causing physical damage to wireless handheld appliances and embedded wireless subsystems;¥jamming of communications capabilities;¥performing a denialofservice attack on communications capabilities by overloading networkswith bogus communications;¥performing a denialofservice attack by revoking the access privileges of legitimate users andsystems;¥spoofing sensors (i.e., causing false readings that result in the dissemination of misinformation);¥evading sensor detection

past 50 years, the united states has enjoyed air dominance in all of its conflicts. no u.s.warfighter died from attack by an enemy aircraft during that time. in addition, in several recent conflicts,u.s. aircraft have been consistently able to penetrate hostile airspace, attack targets with unprecedentedaccuracy, and return to base with few or no losses. what technologies have led to this unprecedentedsuccess, and how much longer will the united states continue to enjoy these advantages? the answersto these questions form the basis for new research to maintain current u.s. advantages and a search fornew technologies to allow it to stay a step ahead of developments elsewhere.several technologies have been responsible for this u.s. supremacy. the first that merits discussionis radar stealth. in the 1970s it became obvious that, through the use of special coatings and aircraftshape management, the radar cross section (rcs) of an aircraft could be reduced enormously, therebyenabling operations within hostile airspace with relative protection from gunlaying and missiletrackingradars. aircraft such as the b2 and the f117 were developed employing these technologies. theirsuccess has been spectacular.getting to a target undetected, however, is only half the challenge. once there, an aircraft mustidentify the target and destroy it. technologies for precision allweather target strike were developedthat reduced targetmiss distance to just a few feet. probably most important to this achievement werethe invention and deployment of the global positioning system (gps) for positioning and munitionguidance, laser target designation, and enhanced aircraft avionics systems.underlying all of these aspects of u.s. air dominance is the infrastructure that supports themñaninfrastructure that is difficult for others to replicate owing to the resources required. besides the qualityof the aircraft themselves and the highly trained aircrews who fly them, the primary enabler is the tankerfleet that allows longrange strike to anywhere in the world from the united states. this capability isbest exemplified by the 30hour missions flown by the b2 in recent conflicts. even forwardbasedaircraft need tanker support to reach many targets or to loiter before being called in.while u.s. air dominance is unlikely to be jeopardized by symmetric means, particularly in the nearterm, technology trends in commercialization and globalization suggest that new types of threats may beavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.46avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advanceson the horizon. the united states has long since lost the lead in the manufacture of electronics (thetechnology of which is driven by worldwide commercial and consumer concerns rather than by aerospace, as was the case in the 1950s and 1960s). now, the united states is also no longer dominant in themanufacture of commercial aircraft in terms of either manufacturing or technology. in addition tocompetition from foreign producers, u.s.òproducedó aircraft are assembled from parts largely madeoverseas. even u.s.òmadeó subsystems and assemblies are increasingly assembled from parts engineered and produced in areas where costs are lower, such as china, india, and the former eastern bloc.large u.s. aerospace and electronics companies have set up research organizations in these regions foreconomic reasons. this offshore sourcing is having the effect of building up research, development, andmanufacturing capability in other countries in aerospace and related fields.one pillar of u.s. airpower in the past has been the capabilities of its major platforms. thesesophisticated platforms now require investments of tens of billions of dollars spread over decades,investment levels that few foes can match. however, the life of the advanced technology in theseplatforms can now be less than the development cycle. small unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) offer acounter to large platformsñwhile much less capable than the large platforms at present, they can havemuch shorter and less costly development cycles. these factors contribute to the proliferation of suchvehicles around the world, especially at the smaller sizes (munson, 1996).the new technologies delineated above combined with the globalization of the aerospace andelectronics businesses imply that current u.s. aerospace supremacy will face new classes of challengesfrom new adversariesña few of which are described below.obviously, negating radar stealth must be high on the list of technologies for red forces to pursue.the antidote to this nationõs stealth advantage takes two formsñdirect and indirect. to negate u.s.radar stealth advantages directly requires the development of radars with different and improved characteristics. for example, the power of the radar can be increased to illuminate even small rcs targets.changes in frequencies and radaremanation management can also help. on an indirect basis, othersensors could be perfected that can precisely track aircraft, such as improved infrared (ir) or opticalsensors. all of these require a high degree of sophistication to invent, but they can be sold to and usedby relatively unsophisticated buyers with hostile intentions.the difficulty of gps interference has been the subject of great conjecture. suffice to say that redforces could profit enormously if the system could be shut down or biased in such a way as to interferewith weapons accuracy.other ways to interfere with or reduce the advantages of u.s. airpower include the use of electromagnetic pulse (emp) radiation to shut down onboard targeting systems, the spoofing of targetingsystems, the burying or hardening of highvalue targets, population shielding (urban targets), the use oflaser absorption material, and many more.the scope of this report does not allow delving into all of these possibilities. thus, to make the taskmanageable, the complex challenge of successfully attacking urban targets is discussed as an example ofone mission scenario. this scenario was selected in part because the committee believes that it representsa current as well as an enduring challenge, with particular relevance to the global war on terrorism.airpower in urban warfarein general, the current use of u.s. airpower in urban warfare can be grouped into the following fourbroad categories that underpin the operational concepts delineated in joint vision 2020 (the concepts aredominant maneuver, precision engagement, focused logistics, and full dimensional protection) (jcs,2000):avoiding surprise in an era of global

personnel and material;¥strike (the destruction of preidentified targets); and¥close air support (strike in close cooperation with and in support of troops on the ground).the urban environment is the arena in which u.s. airpower is currently the least effective anddecisive. masking from urban clutter can be severe, greatly reducing the field of view and utility of mostairborne sensor systems. transport is restricted to rotarywing or verticaltakeoffandlanding (vtol)aircraft, since landing areas are small and such vehicles are under severe threat at low altitude fromsmall arms, rocketpropelled grenades (rpgs), and so on. strike and close air support with precisionmunitions can be effective when ground troops identify targets, but the effects of current weapons canbe on a larger scale than is desirable (e.g., destruction of buildings rather than rooms) and differ littlefrom those of precision artillery.historically, isr, transport, strike, and close air support have been executed by manned, fixedwingand rotary aircraft, to and from which information flows through other aircraft or space assets (which arenot discussed further in this chapter). the definition and nature of airpower are changing, however.within the past decade, uavs such as the global hawk and predator have taken over some isrmissions. uav strike missions that have been demonstrated in combat with existing aircraft and experimental unmanned combat air vehicles (ucavs) designed specifically for strike are now flying (the x45 and x47). while unmanned, these uavs of the u.s. air force and u.s. navy, respectively, are aslarge as manned aircraft. as part of its future combat system (fcs), the u.s. army plans to adoptrelatively large, automated, fixed and rotarywing vehicles as well (gabbert, 2004). however, the u.s.army and u.s. marine corps also plan to field much smaller aerial vehiclesñdown to a few inches inwingspanñwhich can be carried and deployed by individual soldiers (tousley, 2004). indeed, a motivation for these socalled micro air vehicles (mavs) is urban warfare, in which bird or even insectsizedvehicles could be of use for surveillance and reconnaissance in the cluttered urban environment, evenwithin buildings.the committee believes that the ability of red forces to field large forces of mavs developed withcommercial offtheshelf (cots) products represents a significant threat to u.s. air dominanceñparticularly in the area of surveillance and reconnaissance in urban environments. given trends in theglobal commercial marketplace, future adversaries will have lowcost options that could negate theadvantage held by todayõs blue forces.assessments of future threats to u.s. airpower must take into consideration the full range of futureairpowerñincluding u.s. and adversary air assets ranging from large, manned platforms at medium andhigh altitudes, to lowflying rotary aircraft, to mavs flying among and inside buildings. in the following sections, the committee discusses some challenges to u.s. airpower, describing the highlevelcharacteristics of red systems that could constrain or defeat this power and technology developmentsthat may enable such systems.challenges to u.s. airpowera major objective of u.s. airpower is to enable access to the battlefield for u.s. ground, sea, and airforces while denying that access to an adversary. such access forms a foundation upon which u.s.military plans are constructed and has been achieved with little serious challenge for the past fivedecades. the advantages of this access are readily apparent to the worldõs military organizations, andantiaccess strategies and tactics are a major focus of military planners. evolving and disruptive techavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.48avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesnologies, used with innovative tactics, may offer the potential to challenge and disrupt u.s. airpower ascurrently envisioned.an adversary can potentially challenge, reduce, or even negate the impact of u.s. airpower in manyways. these approaches can be characterized as either offensive or defensive:¥offensiveñthreaten, disable, or destroy aircraft (manned or unmanned);ñdisrupt targeting (jam gps, compromise òidentification friendorfoeó [iff], regulate proximityof restricted facilities); andñdisrupt information flow (jam communications, disrupt asset management within networkcentric operations, disrupt sensors, and so on).¥defensiveñdisperse forces geographically, andñhide (camouflage, spoof, bury or harden structures, disrupt sensors).offensive techniques that may be employed by an adversarythreatening, damaging, or destroying aircraft are obviously effective techniques for constrainingu.s. airpower. these can be manifested as traditional airtoair threats (fighters and airtoair missiles),traditional surfacetoair threats (guns and groundtoair missiles), and hightechnology worries yet tobe seen on the battlefield (such as electromagnetic pulse [emp] weapons, lasers, stealth aircraft detection,and chemical and biological threats to the aircraft). while to an adversary, threatening a u.s. aircraftmay not be as satisfying as destroying it, a threat can be effective in denying the access that u.s. forcesneed. the results of such threats may be (1) to force vulnerable u.s. assets (such as tankers or israircraft) back from the battlefront, (2) to force attack aircraft up to altitudes at which they are lesseffective, (3) to funnel aircraft into specific corridors, (4) to constrain or prevent aerial resupply, and(5)to constrain the types of aircraft that the united states is willing to employ to those of which it hasvery few (such as stealthy and electronic countermeasures [ecm] aircraft). these outcomes can allserve to reduce the effectiveness of u.s. airpower to a significant degree, given an imposing threat.another technique for countering u.s. airpower is to disrupt targeting (deny precision engagement). in this case, while the united states has located a target, the opponent has taken action to reducethe ability or willingness of the united states to destroy it. increasingly, facilities are deeply buried toreduce their vulnerability to conventional weapons (this also makes them more difficult to locate oridentify precisely). a related approach is to position a facility so that geographic masking combinedwith the kinematics of missile and bomb dynamics frustrates weapons trajectories. the previous twocases are examples of reducing the u.s. ability to destroy a target.often as effective, and much cheaper than reducing the ability of the united states to destroy atarget, is positioning a target so as to reduce u.s. willingness to destroy it. this includes target placement within, under, or near such civilian structures as schools, hospitals, marketplaces, and houses ofworship (an approach well suited to urban environments). these are passive, lowtechnology approachesto frustrating u.s. targeting. active approaches are possible as well. they might include foiling of thesystems that the united states uses to identify its forces on the battlefield (socalled iff and blue forcetracking technologies). compromising or spoofing these systems can permit a foe to masquerade as u.s.forces or to introduce uncertainty and fear of friendly fire. even more active techniques involve thejamming of precisionguided weapons gps and electrooptical navigation guidance systems. suchavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.future threats to u.s. airpower in urban warfare49active techniques require sophisticated knowledge of precisionguided weapons technologies, can besensitive to countercountermeasures, and so are of most value when used with tactical surprise.defensive techniques that may be employed by an adversaryairpower is most effective when the adversary masses its forces. historically, it is least effectivewhen the enemy disperses. operation strangle in world war ii (again in korea) and rolling thunder invietnam are historical examples in which interdiction has been shown to be ineffective when the enemydisperses its forces. likewise, during the air war over serbia, when the serbs dispersed their tanks anddid not move them, u.s. airpower was relatively ineffective against their armor. many will argue thattank killing was not a primary mission, but in fact an enemy dispersed creates a situation that reducesairpowerõs effectiveness. similarly, in the current operations in iraq, the ability of the enemy to remaindispersed, but to be able to mass in time and at a place to achieve limited tactical advantage has provento be a unique challenge for the u.s. military, despite tactical superiority.if this historical trend continues, there is every reason to assume that future adversaries will migrateaway from forceonforce situations whenever possible, because whenever they mass, they becomevulnerable. the unique challenge for airpower in the future is to become effective against an adversarythat disperses, in order to be able to provide the intelligence regarding enemy positions and intent beforethe enemy masses at the tactical level. for the future enemy, the challenge will be to acquire technologies that allow it to remain hidden, communicate at will with dispersed forces, then form at the timeand place of its choosing.while dispersion is a tactic as old as warfare, advanced technology can enhance an adversaryõscapability to disperse, remain hidden, and coalesce when the time is right. technologies that aid dispersion include the following:¥secure communications. secure communications, especially lowcost military or commercial implementations, enable rapid force dispersal and constitution. there are many aspects to communications security, including security of the waveform (spread spectrum, temporal compression, andso on), security of the information (encryption), and security of fixed infrastructure. as commercial and consumer users become more concerned with communications security, commerciallyavailable strong encryption and the incorporation of such encryption into lowcost cellular phones,walkietalkies, and personal digital assistants will enhance an adversaryõs dispersal capabilities.¥lowcost, portable stealth technologies. these technologies would enhance a dispersed foeõsability to hide assets such as vehicles. specifically, the development of lightweight, flexiblemultispectral (light/radio frequency [rf]) òcamouflage nettingó would reduce the effectivenessof many advanced u.s. airborne and spaceborne sensors.¥advanced, lowcost multispectral decoys. these decoys would reduce the effectiveness of manyadvanced u.s. airborne and spaceborne sensors, require the expenditure of additional (and perhapsexpensive) munitions, and mislead the united states as to the effectiveness of its activities.traditional air superiority combined with precision munitions (precision engagement) has given theunited states the capability to destroy almost any target that it can locate. thus, hiding from u.s. forcesis an attractive counter for adversaries to use. hiding can take many forms, such as traditional camouflage (netting, hiding under foliage, and so on), burying or submerging targets, or actively disruptingsensors (rf or optical jamming). notwithstanding its sophisticated sensors, the united states has yet todemonstrate on the battlefield that hard problems such as tanks under trees and decoy discriminationavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.50avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advanceshave been solved. nevertheless, as the sophistication of u.s. sensors increases, so must the art of hiding:camouflage must be multispectral; burying must account for infrared (ir) perturbations; and acoustic,magnetic, and electromagnetic signatures must be reduced.committee focus: systems that can degrade u.s. airpowerthe systemlevel performance criteria of a new technology determine how and to what degree it canchallenge u.s. airpower. these systemlevel parameters can then be devolved into specific engineeringrequirements that new technologies must meet in order to be effective. clearly, this can be a very largeset. here the committee chooses to list a few specific examples of particular relevance to urban warfare:¥increased effectiveness of manportable air defense systems (manpadss);¥userfriendly, smart weapons;¥acoustic/rf mines;¥shrinking of the systems listed above in size and/or cost;¥micro systems with the effectiveness of large ones; and¥exploitation of commonly available devices.two illustrative examples are presented below. the first example, involving manportable airdefense systems, illustrates the evolution of an existing threat class. the second example, involvingmicro air vehicles and missiles, illustrates the emergence of a new class of threats.manportable air defense systemsmanpadss are antiaircraft missiles small enough to be carried and launched by one or two people.these are currently a major threat to lowaltitude aircraft. the nature of the threat ranges from shortrange, lowaccuracy rocketpropelled grenades to sophisticated guided weapons with cooled, multibandsensors and ranges of several kilometers. the importance of the threat stems from manpadssõrelatively low cost (and so, ready availability and proliferation), lack of prelaunch warning cues (such asradar illumination), and the low level of training and logistics support required. the effectiveness of a particular missile design is a strong function of the performance of its seekerand vehicle kinematics. here, òseekeró refers to the combination of the sensor and guidance system. theseeker performance determines the target acquisition range, the aspect of the target that can be attacked,the resistance of the missile to countermeasures, and target closure accuracy. the vehicle dynamics setthe missile range and maneuver performance.technology trends are already making such missile systems easier to support, deploy, hide, and use.improved system characteristics such as those described below may further increase the effectiveness ofmanpadss, and thus the seriousness of their threat.increased range and/or reduced signature¥increasing range. improving this characteristic would increase the threat footprint; threaten midand highaltitude aircraft, including isr assets; and increase the slant range so that, for example,transports that stay within an airport perimeter would be at risk from remote launch sites.¥lowopticalemission propulsion. many aircraft missile countermeasure systems use the opticalemission from the missile launch to queue the defense. thus, no signature, no warning, noavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.future threats to u.s. airpower in urban warfare51defense. extending the definition of reduced optical emission to include smoke helps to mask thelaunch location and thus increase the tactical utility of the missile.enhanced guidance, navigation, and/or targeting¥multimode seekers. this improved technology would reduce or eliminate the effectiveness ofcountermeasures or permit nonlineofsight launches. in addition to multiple optical bands (anapproach currently popular), this might include acoustic or rf cues to allow a missile launchagainst a target not in sight from the launch position. with sufficient range and rf seekerperformance, large radar and battle management aircraft can be placed under threat.¥increased accuracy guidance. the warhead size of a manportable missile is of the order of akilogram. thus, it must detonate very close to a critical location to be effective. increasedguidance accuracy, along with any necessary increase in maneuverability, will improve thelethality of these small missiles, especially against large aircraft.enhanced lethality¥autonomous launch. with sufficiently capable sensors, automated decision making, and hardening, these small missiles can act as aerial mines, threatening any aircraft that flies within range.remote queuing could increase the effectiveness of such systems.¥expanded mission capability. by integrating relatively simple gps guidance, laser capability forprecise geolocation, and data link capability, an adversary could transform a manpads from asurfacetoair weapon into one that can also perform precision engagement missions in thegroundtoground role in a wide variety of mission areas.the interaction among the system characteristics described above is a complex topic beyond thescope of this discussion. simply put, some of these factors are synergistic, some antagonistic, but theyare all quite technologically challenging. realizing such a system is even more challenging when cost isintroduced as a prime consideration. many weapons owe their effectiveness not to their performance orcapabilities but rather to their ubiquitousness. an advanced manpads threat is a combination involving cost and performance.an advanced threat with a potential impact similar to, or more serious than, that of the advancedmanpads discussed above would be the nonnuclear electromagnetic pulse generator, as discussed inchapter 3. the urban environment in particular is rich in opportunities to conceal such weapons.milli to micro air vehicles and missilesmilli to micro air vehicles and missiles1 are generally defined as aerospace systems massing a fewkilograms or less. the confluence of microelectronics, gps, and microelectromechanical systems(mems) now make it feasible to engineer very small uavs and missiles, the capabilities of which willevolve as the enabling technologies advance. the u.s. army and the defense advanced research1micro uavs were defined by darpa to be less than 6 inches in any dimension, but now the army has been using the termfor 12 to 18 inch vehicles. darpa has been trying to define ònanoó as under 2 inches (insect size), despite opposition. thecommittee believes that practical working definitions are as follows: micro = bird sized; nano = insect sized; milli = largerthan the largest bird but smaller than a piper cub.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.52avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesprojects agency (darpa) have been sponsoring work on many small air vehicles, and there is considerable interest around the world on size classes down to a few inches, socalled micro uavs (davis etal., 1996; grasmeyer and keennon, 2001).the united states anticipates using very small uavs for reconnaissance and surveillance. in urbanwarfare, perchandstare applications are receiving attention. of course, these capabilities are of use toa foe as well. such capabilities may be particularly advantageous to an adversary who cannot overcomelarge u.s. aircraft at medium and high altitudes.advantages for small vehicles include very low cost, covertness, maneuverability in a complexurban environment, and freedom from extensive logistics requirements. conceptually, these smallvehicles can be armed and thus be employed as antipersonnel and antiemitter weaponsñin effect,threedimensional mines. vehicles at this size add a new dimension to the concept of air superiority andmay be especially applicable in an urban environment.small vehicles need not be shortranged. elevenpound aircraft powered by modelairplane engineshave flown the atlantic, navigating to a precise landfall with gps (wicks, 2004). attempts are nowunderway by amateurs to fly the pacific. hundredpound intercontinental ballistic missiles have beendesigned (francis, 1999). both aircraft and missiles of these sizes have inherently low signatures and sowill be difficult to locate and track. these ranges imply that u.s. logistics and staging areas can be putat risk. the payloads of these small vehicles are concomitantly small, a few pounds, but are sufficient torepresent a significant threat if carrying chemical, biological, or radiological payloads. given sufficientprecision, even conventionally armed attacks on rear areas may have more than nuisance or politicalvalue. these factors combine to create a potential red force capability that could diminish the advantageprovided by u.s. airpower. in particular, counters to these weapons may consume disproportionate u.s.resources compared to those expended by the attackers.the micro air and space vehicles are enabled by several emerging technologies, the evolution ofwhich will pace the vehiclesõ utility as weapons systems. several examples, again grouped by thesystemlevel capabilities enabled, are described below.increased range and/or reduced signature¥quiet, efficient micro airbreathing propulsion systems. such systems include very small pistonand gas turbine engines with fuel economy approaching that of larger engines; they range inpower from a few kilowatts down to the watt level.¥micro bipropellant liquid rocket engines. these engines use storable propellants with fueleconomy and power density of the best large engines; their sizes range from a hundred poundsdown to pounds.enhanced guidance, navigation, and/or targeting¥micro guidance and navigation systems. these systems consist of capable, chipsized gpsreceivers, mems gyros and accelerometers, and lowpower processors.¥large geographic databases. such databases provide precise, gpscompatible maps of largeregions of the world, including habitation and economic data, for nontimecritical targetinginformation.¥micro digital storage devices to hold large databases. these devices are sufficiently compactthat large, target databases can be deployed with the micro vehicles.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.future threats to u.s. airpower in urban warfare53¥integrated gps communications systems. these systems are for timely updates keyed to geographic databases.all of the enablers listed above exist now at various levels of performance. their continued development and integration could yield extremely capable micro flight vehicles, well suited to mounting alowcost challenge to aspects of u.s. air dominance, especially in an urban environment.identification and assessment steps of committee methodologythe preceding discussion focuses on the system level. here the committee considers individualtechnologies, which, if realized and integrated into a system, can result in significant challenges to u.s.airpower. the technologies are again grouped according to the systemlevel capabilities enabled (increasedrange and/or reduced signature; enhanced guidance, navigation, and/or targeting; and enhanced lethality);in addition to the previously described categories, a òcounterblueó category has been added.given the time available for this task, the examples presented reflect the expertise and experience ofthe committee members rather than representing the result of a systematic, comprehensive study. ineach case the committee identifies the technology and the capability that it may enable, and postulatesopen source indications and motivators for domestic or foreign researchers to work in this direction.increased range and/or reduced signaturethe signature of a vehicleõs propulsion system is a major contributor to the overall vulnerability ofthe vehicle. the propulsion system and its fuel make up 40 to 90 percent of the initial mass of poweredflight vehicles, while the payload is usually only 10 to 20 percent (even less for launch vehicles, at 1 to2 percent). thus, small changes in the performance or characteristics of the propulsion system can havea large impact on the payload, range, maneuverability, or vulnerability of an aircraft or missile. technological advances considered here (see charts 41 through 46) include propulsion systems as well asother techniques that could extend the range or reduce the signature of air vehicles.enhanced guidance, navigation, and/or targetingthe technologies described in this subsection (see charts 47 through 412), which are likely toemerge in the global commercial marketplace, provide improved performance for guidance and navigation or targeting systems.enhanced lethalitythe evolving technologies described in charts 413 through 419 may serve to enhance the lethalityof red force capabilities.counterbluethe technologies described in charts 420 through 423 could be used to negate the blue forceadvantage.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.54avoiding surprise in

best way todefeat u.s. airpower: that is, not necessarily the headtohead, platformtoplatform approach of thecold war, but rather the exploitation of asymmetries.this chapter discusses in broad terms the threats posed by advanced manpadss and milli to microair vehicles and missiles, considering systemlevel characteristics such as increased range and reducedsignature; enhanced guidance, navigation, and/or targeting; and enhanced lethality. for each area,technologies that may enable such red force capabilities are identified and assessed. finally, severaltechnologies that may enable red forces to counter blue forcesñeither directly or indirectlyñareidentified and assessed.although u.s. air dominance is unlikely to be jeopardized in the near term by symmetric means, thecommittee believes that global technology trends suggest new types of threats that may be on thehorizon.referencespublisheddavis, w.r., b.b. kosicki, d.m. boroson, and d.f. kostishack. 1996. micro air vehicles for optical

technology advances625combatant identification in urban warfareintroductionthis chapter addresses new technology developments that might assist enemy combatants by allowing their identity and that of innocent noncombatants to be intermixed. appropriate òspoofingó or othertypes of misidentification could cause the warfighter to engage a group of noncombatants, thus causingpolitical and/or psychological damage to u.s. forces.the type of combat situationñurban warfareñaddressed here is a scenario in which the unitedstates is increasingly engaged. this chapter describes potential techniques for sensor spoofing and forhiding red forces, as well as some enabling technologies.the enemy engaging in this type of warfare is often technologically nimble but unable to afford oreven consider large weapons systems. commercial technology of superior quality and capability thatmay be readily available from nonu.s. suppliers is a likely source of components for adversarysystems. the synergistic trends of globalization and commercialization of science and technology arecreating an environment in which u.s. forces may unexpectedly find themselves vulnerable. oneexample of offshore technology strength is the infrared (ir) laserdiode technology, which is effectivein irthermal source spoofing. this technology was initially developed in the united states and is nowmanufactured and sold commercially in switzerland.1key features of foreign urban warfaremodern urban warfare has been described extensively in connection with many wars over the past50 to 75 years. instances of such warfare include german/soviet combat in stalingrad, u.s. combat insomalia and iraq, and russian combat in chechnya (beevor, 1998; bowden, 1999). this type of combathas several distinct characteristics, including the following:1for more information, see, for example, http://www.alpeslasers.ch/. last accessed on april 1, 2005.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.combatant identification in urban warfare63¥complex òterrain.ó heavy combat in cities and large towns generates a chaotic artificial terrain.the lack of a clear line of combat as well as the presence of dust and smoke can make identification of combatants difficult or impossible. combatants can easily remain hidden until detailedsearches, lasting many days, are completed.¥short line of sight. urban combat occurs in an environment of extremely short lines of sight.intense firefights between neighboring rooms in a housing unit, for example, are characterized byshort range and a common element of surprise. reaction time is very short, and positive identification may be possible only ex post facto.¥intermixing of noncombatants (noncombatants) and combatants. when population densities arehigh, it is impossible to rule out the presence of significant numbers of noncombatants. in manycases these people are the most vulnerable of the former population, since it is hardest for them toleave the combat zone quickly. this situation makes it difficult for troops to engage enemy troopswithout fear of incurring casualties among noncombatants.¥need for precision delivery of weapons. because of the short distances, complex terrain, andmixing of targets, urban combat requires the ability to deliver ordnance with precision so thatcollateral damage is minimized. this capability is compromised if noncombatant or red teamidentification is spoofed.committee focus: capability to discriminate between enemycombatants and noncombatantsone form of misidentification relates to the issue of fratricide, which in itself is very challenging andhas been addressed in other studies. a report from the office of technology assessment entitled whogoes there: friend or foe? discusses the persian gulf war and the problem of fratricide. during thatconflict, 24 percent of u.s. combat fatalities were due to friendly fire (u.s. congress, ota, 1993).there is an optimal level of antifratricide measures beyond which more stringent measures could lead toincreased losses from enemy fire owing to slow reaction times. the four pillars of fratricide preventionare doctrine, training, rules of engagement, and technology, as viewed from a blue force perspective(armstrong, 1999). while related to the topic at hand, the avoidance of fratricide is not the central focusof the committee in this chapter; its focus instead is on the capability of discriminating between enemycombatants and noncombatants.rules of engagement from a red force perspective include causing confusion, hiding among thenoncombatant population in areas not necessarily designated as combat zones, jamming electronicdevices, and moving so that prior reconnaissance or mapping by the blue force is of limited utility.when cast in the context of urban warfare, the scenarios become even more complex, if only becausenoncombatants must also be positively identified to avoid harming them.the techniques for the identification of noncombatants in combat areas are stressed to the limit inurban warfare, principally because of the short timescale of combat and the possibility that largenumbers of noncombatants might be present. spoofing of sensors, including both visual and electronicimaging systems, compromises the blue forceõs ability to carry out precision engagements and mayendanger noncombatants. recent examples of urban combat have included the use of noncombatants asshields by enemy combatants. finally, groundtoground combat even under the best of circumstances isprone to error; the fratricide rate during desert storm was 69 percent attributable to groundtogroundcombat (u.s. congress, ota, 1993). urban environments further exacerbate the challenge relating tothe discrimination of combatant forces.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights

technologies that may be exploited by theenemy to degrade blue force capabilities relating to identification of friend or foe (iff) and, morespecifically, to discrimination between enemy combatants and noncombatants. enemy combatants mayleverage technological advances available in the global marketplace to develop methods of causing falseidentification of noncombatant parties as combatants. this situation could lead to the blue forceõsinflicting of casualties among the noncombatants and thus cause serious psychological damage to theblue forces and/or divert attention from the central blue force combat mission. such events inevitablylead to political damage to the united states as well. below, the committee describes three techniquesthat may be employed by red forces to degrade the ability of blue forces to discriminate enemytargets.misdirected target designationblue forces wish to engage only red forces and related enemy targets. currently, laserdesignationtechnology is used to enable the precision guidance of weapons. red forcesõ acquisition of inexpensivecommercial laser systems, misleading designation and hence misleading weapons guidance parameters,could lead to the misdirection of munitions onto politically or psychologically sensitive targets. suchtechnology is accessible to red forces in the form of rapidly advancing, lowcost, diodelaser technology. the stateoftheart small, compact, diodedriven solidstate lasers are currently in the hands ofoverseas manufacturers that in many cases are the dominant manufacturer of these systems. thesesystems can be used to misdirect weapons, either by blinding the weapon or by retargeting it, so as tocause substantial noncombatant casualties.an important technology in target designation is the use of wavelength tuning to prevent detectionof the designating laser system. this can be an effective technique, since narrowband filters decrease thedetection wavelength òbandwidthó and hence prevent outofband spoofing. at present there are anumber of lowcost ir laser devices, which can be made wavelength agile (tunable). at the other end ofthe spectrum, an example of highcost and advanced ir laser technology is the òquantum cascadeó laser,which emits throughout the near and medium infrared.sensor spoofinganother method of iff sensor spoofing by red forces relies on the blue forcesõ use of sensortechnology to identify military targets and to distinguish these from related civilian or noncombatantentities. for example, if an ir sensor has sufficient resolution or can use a feature such as spectralsignature to discriminate among targets, it can be used as a reliable method for iff. one example, whichdoes use spectralsensitive signatures, is an active forwardlooking infrared (flir) system. as describedbelow, these same technologies may be used by red forces to spoof blue force sensors.tunable lasersthe national research council report entitled opportunities in biotechnology for future armyapplications further analyzes the possibilities for red force spoofing of blue force identificationmeasures. as stated in that report, òbecause humans, tanks, and other military structures have a significantly different reflectivity than plants and trees, the enemy can easily identify military targets withavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.combatant identification in urban warfare65inexpensive infrared lasers with wavelengthscanning capabilityó (nrc, 2001). if, on the other hand,the red force were to possess such tunable lasers, it could rapidly mimic the key spectral ingredients invarious targets and use this knowledge to spoof civilian targets in a way that could cause them to beerroneously identified as bona fide red targets. for military structures, because a small fraction of theòtarget would be observable because of its distinctive spectral properties it may be possible to developpaints with terahertz and infrared reflectivity identical to trees or grass, possibly using geneticallyengineered plant protein as the active mediumó (nrc, 2001). see chart 51.false radio frequency identification signalsradiofrequency (rf) sensors are also vulnerable to spoofing. radiofrequency identification(rfid) is a technology that uses various rf bands to probe a transponder carried by blue forces or afriendly noncombatant. the transponder then responds to this probe, using either onboard (battery)energy or power from the interrogating beam to cause a coded reply, which can be read by the interrogator. the market for this technology is expanding rapidly, because rfid is useful for a wide variety ofcommercial applications such as merchandise identification, automatic toll payment, animal identification and tracking, and so on. since the heart of the technology is microchips and advanced microwavedevices, it can be expected to advance further in sophistication and availability over the next decade.for the same reasons that rfid will continue to develop, òfalse tagó methods will also grow incapability. these methods could enable red forces to òmasqueradeó as friendly forces, thus diminishingblue forcesõ confidence in rfid. see chart 52.technologyobservablestunable lasersthese lasers were invented and developedin the united states, but they are

increasing availability of lowcostlasers and holographic images. in urban warfare, reaction time is very short, and the sudden appearanceof any image may immediately elicit a responseñfor example, a programmed false image could provokefiring at an inappropriate target. the ingredients for this technology are powerful personal computers,advanced lasers, and realtime holographic media. all of these are advancing rapidly, owing in largepart to demands from the commercial marketplace.while the examples provided below may seem farfetched for a warfare environment, the committeebelieves that there is some value in tracking such emerging technologies, since they may spawn redforce tactics that could be difficult to counter. it should be noted that the committee did not have time toseparate òmarketing hypeó from actual capabilities in the examples below.figure 51 shows the result of a system in which a òmicroscopic pattern of particles [is] suspendedin a transparent medium that simultaneously diffracts, reflects and transmits all wavelengths of light.through this proprietary process the transscreen displays a projected image as well as allows you to seebeyond the image

space in front of the kiosk. even though the projection source is within the kioskhousing, the image appears out in front of the display. in pictures below you will see hands pointing at ornear the projected image. to the person viewing the holomirror they are really seeing their hand passingthrough the object or they are seeing the 3d image hovering above or below their hand. it is impossibleto show the true 3d effect here in photographs. but these pictures will give you a bit of an idea of whathappens when you experience a holomirror in person. laser magic offers two types of holomirror 3dvolumetric projectors.3figure 53 illustrates a lifesize hologram. according to the manufacturerõs web site:there is nothing like the magic of a real hologram. itõs like a window into another world. view it fromone angle and a crystal clear 3d image is clearly visible. step to the side and the image disappearswithout a trace. as you walk back and forth in front of a hologram, the image moves and you can seearound it as if it were really there.4projection of a programmed false image could provoke blue forces to fire on an inappropriatetarget. the committee has considered scenarios in which such capabilities may become more accessibleto red forces as materials suitable for projecting and showing the images are commercialized andadapted in consumer and fashion marketing. see chart

uniforms. one[example of this approach] uses mimicking of the mechanical chromatic effects that birds and fruits use.the exquisite color patterns on the feathers of birds are the result of the intricate structural pattern ofeach feather that enables it to diffract light. this phenomenon, mechanical chromatophores, is alsoexhibited by some varieties of fruits. another natural phenomenon that might be valuable for camouflage is the biochromatic behavior of some reptiles. the chameleon, for example, can change color andpatterns in accordance with the environment. camouflage with this property would automatically changeto blend with the environment, such as snowcovered terrain, desert sand, dense and light vegetation,daylight and darkness (nrc, 2001).prominent research centers in the united states and elsewhere are working on adaptive materialsñin particular, exploiting polymers, biomimetic structures, and nanotechnology. both the defenseadvanced research projects agency and the u.s. army support research in this area, advances in whichcould eventually lead to capabilities that enable red force hiding.5,6 acquisition of such technology byred forces would enable them to spoof blue forces by camouflaging their appearance and makingthemselves harder to detect. see chart 54.new types of stealth could become available in the form of coatings that consist of microwaveabsorbing paint (see chart 55), or interactive displays of the type described above. blue forcedevelopment of an intelligent surface coating that is readily apparent for night vision, or, conversely,that neutralizes night vision in a manner that could redirect ordnance, could become a red forceadvantage if the technology is redirected to spoof night vision. advances in irabsorbing coatings(proteins), temperaturenoncombatant materials, and heatemitting coatings could enable such capabilities.the availability of irabsorbing coatings may be a nearterm possibility. commercial

form of a film that can be inserted into the joint.the medium absorbs ir laser light, allowing an almost invisible weld to be produced between materialsthat are required to be clear or have a predetermined color.the nrc (2001) report also discusses biological methods that may be employed by red forces toevade detection:biological means might also be useful for avoiding radar detection. some biomolecules have long beenknown to be strong microwave absorbers. for example, bacteriorhodopsin has strong microwave absorptivity (3 ghz to 40 ghz). scientists are investigating the use of chemically, and possibly genetically,modified bacteriorhodopsin protein as the active medium in microwaveabsorbing paint for both tanksand planes. the absorption mechanism appears to be associated with the motion of monovalent anddivalent metal cations within channels, e.g., mg(ii), ca(ii). if this theory is correct, proteins could beengineered to have precise microwave absorption bands and then fine tuned for anticipated threats in agiven theater of operation. microtubules, which are also excellent microwave absorbers, may be evenbetter microwave absorbers and more easily fine tuned. because much of the research in this area isclassified, the committee was not able to make recommendations in this area (nrc, 2001).is a protein with the appropriate optical and physical properties a possibility in the near future?according to the nrc (2001):from 1975 to 1995, scientists in the former soviet union participated in a governmentsponsored program to leapfrog the west in computer technology by exploring proteinbased bioelectronics. many ofthe anticipated applications were military and may therefore be important to the u.s. army, but detailsremain classified. one of the bestknown accomplishments of the soviet project was the development ofbiochrome, a realtime photochromic and holographic film based on chemically modified polymer filmscontaining bacteriorhodopsin (vsevolodov and poltoratskii, 1985; bunkin et al., 1981). the publishedphotochromic and holographic properties of bacteriorhodopsin stimulated the international research thatcontinues today. the protein bacteriorhodopsin is representative of the potential that proteins may havefor future army applications (nrc, 2001).avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.combatant identification in urban warfare71inexpensive supply of raw materials for camouflagean impediment to red or blue forcesõ implementation of technology such as that describedabove is the availability of materials in sufficient quantities to be useful. to overcome this barrier,agricultural biotechnology might be used for the largescale production of some new materials. forexample, òthe protein from soybeans can be refined and sold for only pennies per pound of protein,substantially less than the cost of manufacturing equivalent synthetic polymersó (nrc, 2001). in addition, ògenetically engineered crops (transgenic crops) could potentially deliver recombinant proteinsdirectly with the food or feed products in which they are foundó (nrc, 2001). when it is consideredfurther that such crops could be cultivated in caves (òunderground agricultureó), the production, usingrelatively low technology, of some types of materials that have the capability of obfuscating the identification of noncombatants or a red force is a remote possibility. see chart 56.summarythe committee notes that u.s. leadership in research or manufacturing can no longer be assumed ina number of the technologies discussed in this chapter. japan, for example, is extremely strong in manyareas of nanotechnology and in optical and electronic devices. china is, in many cases (such asphotonics), the country with the best combination of hightechnology manufacturing and design, andchinese capabilities are increasingly employed by many hightechnology u.s. firms. europe hasexcellent research capabilities in the areas of semiconductor materials and devices; these can be andhave been translated into startup corporations.as a result of this shift to offshore commercial vendors, important indicators are likely to appear inopen source literature, including commercial internet sites, and at industrial fairs particularly in asiaand europe. the monitoring of key corporations is important. however, in many cases small or obscurestartups are also of vital importance (suggesting that the tracking of venture capital may offer yetanother set of relevant observables). in certain cases, the observation of critical manufacturing items(raw materials and/or equipment) may be useful, since the global marketplace, together with internetaccessible òdirections,ó is empowering friend and foe alike.referencesarmstrong, steven e. 1999. fratricide: fact or fiction? naval war college, newport, r.i. available online at

initiativesintroductiondevelopments in biological and biochemical technologies relevant to modern warfare are advancingrapidly. technology contributions come from scientists working in academic, military, and industrialenvironments in many countries. information from academic laboratories is usually published in opensource literature, but advances made both by military research laboratories doing biomedical researchand by biotechnology companies are likely to be tightly held secrets or proprietary. therefore, for theunited states to maintain superiority requires being prepared for new developments through constantvigilance, research, and information gathering.modern techniques allow easy manipulation of the genetic information carried by viruses, bacteria,parasites, cells, and organisms. one obvious area in which biological research is relevant to the health ofwarfighters is the development of pathogens that are engineered to be resistant to current antibiotics orvaccines, to be more virulent, or to be more easily transmitted. this area of biological warfare, whichhas been examined by a number of other committees, is excluded from the tasks of this committee at therequest of the technology warning division and is not included in this report.beyond biological warfare, however, there are many ways in which biological techniques can beused to alter the mental or physical readiness of troops for battle, to confound current methods fordetecting biological or chemical agents in the field, or to divert the energies of troops to tasks that arecounterproductive; or, such techniques can be used as means for developing bioinspired approaches forcommunication. this chapter highlights examples of some of these technologies and assesses theirstates of development. the approach taken here involves first postulating new blue force capabilitiesthat leverage this burgeoning research field and then evaluating potential red force applications ofrelated technologies.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.74avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advanceswatching

to understand scientifically how persons can behave in ways thatwestern political, psychological, and psychiatric criteria define as pathological. this inability to understand motivation has caused u.s. military planning and response strategy to be focused on preemptively,post hoc punishment and on attempts to educate through ineffective traditional propaganda and occasional òactive measures.óthe reason for the confounding nature of the problem and for the failure of this nation to stem itsgrowth relate directly to the simple fact that traditional western models of behavior cast such actions aspsychopathological. it is likely that these actions, rather than being pathological in the contexts in whichthey reside, are the actions of rational thought and of educational processes

u.s. research community is now poised to change the paradigm of dealing withbehavioral phenomena in subjective western practice.the technologies of structural magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and functional mri (fmri),magnetoencephalography (meg), and nearinfrared spectroscopy (nirs) are being newly applied torealtime brain imaging. during the brain scans, the subjects of the experiments observe, throughvirtualreality technology, images, sounds, and voice commands, and they also see written text. onlineproprietary software ensures in real time that the appropriate (hypothesized from

cultural affects of personality, fashioned especially in fundamentalist ashrams and islamicfundamentalist schools for preteenagers; (2) ideographic, tonal, and symbolic languages (e.g., farsi,hindi,

isobjective and repeatable. it is independent of preassigned values of any cultural disposition or orientation.the neurophysiology of thought is being studied now in experiments that demonstrate the active braincenters that subtend language differences, emotional experience (moral repugnance, fear, anger, disgust,sadness, and pleasure), and valuebased religious and personal experience.brain imaging is an area of active research; while discernible progress has been achieved, its fullpotential is as yet unknown. brainimaging technologies may provide a better understanding of behavior,performance, readiness, and stress that is relevant to troop readiness, understanding of cultural differences in motivation, and prisoner motivation. additional, related information is provided in appendixe,which also includes more specific descriptions of how such advances could be used by blue forces.committee focus: challenges to communications superioritycommunications superiority plays a dominant role in the effectiveness of blue force operations.this capability relies on sophisticated technologies and flexible networking of the knowledge generatedthrough such technologies. today u.s. forces òown the c4isr [command, control, communications,computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] information network,ó although the directchallenges described in chapter 3 are on the horizon.the covert transmission of information between forces is essential to effective timing and control ofactions (both offensive and defensive). achieving red force command, control, and communications(including intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance) among its independent, dispersedunits could support effective guerilla engagement of traditional forces. such communications mightinvolve the transmission and receipt of short messages (e.g., commands that trigger prearranged events,coordination for precision fire, or relocation of operations) or more complex messages (e.g., thoseestablishing strategies, complex timing, tiered responses, or detailed changes in operations). a framework to achieve effective, inexpensive, yet reliable communication between red force units underthese conditions must be easily accessible, undetected by blue forces, and sufficiently robust to carryall of the required information in a manner that can be validated. hiding simple to complex packets ofinformation in easily accessible physical form or in widely accessible databases could support the basicrequirements. integrating such seemingly innocuous databases with traditional mail that is physicallyhanded off, or with a global, instantaneous, freeaccess communications system could generate thecapability for red force c4isr across dispersed, independent units.the transmission of encrypted messages across the internet is commonplace, but it provides nocover of invisibility to its users. hiding information within seemingly innocuous transmissions(steganography) could further veil the information. a successfully hidden message may be overlookedas a part of something else, whether that is the physical package of the information (such as microdots)or the complexity of the message medium itself (such as hidden information in digital images). forexample, steganography can be used for the legitimate validation of image authenticity. the content idforum and the digital content association of japan have created digital watermarks, equivalent to shortavoiding surprise in an era of global technology

allows a single letter ofascii (american standard code for information interchanges) text to be fixed across three pixels,2generating enough capacity to carry a small message hidden in the noise of the image signal. however,as document size increases, the induced noise will degrade the quality of the image to the point ofbecoming detectable.covert communications via dnaone inexpensive and reliable way to transmit more complex information might be to hide data ormessages in the sequences of dna or in the databases describing the sequences of dna (or in thesequences and structural data of proteins) that are so prevalent in the scientific literature. while digitalsystems are binary in nature, the information content of a dna database is coded in a basefoursequence represented by the letters a, t, c, and g. (in a physical sense, the actual structure andsequences of dna that hold a potential data density are more than 1 million gigabits per square inch,compared with a typical pc hard drive of approximately 7 gigabits per square inch.3) recent publications have projected this approach to the construction of actual dna containing hidden messages.typically, data describing functional dna in the scientific literature contain large stretches of sequences that are not intimately related to the function of the gene. the capacity of the human genomedatabase to hold steganographic data without exceeding the normal noisetosignal ratio is enormous.researchers clelland and bancroft developed a simple physical methodology to encode and recoversecret dna messages embedded in the 3 millionfold excess of normal human dna.4 however, thereis potentially a much more rapid and simpler way of transmitting the hidden information than physicallymoving constructed dna as samples or microdots. simply encrypting a message into the basefourlanguage of dna (ibm has developed a language for storing information in dna sequence data5)might be sufficient to hide messages between red force teams. such coded information might seemperfectly normal in the context of daily scientific discussions on the internet.

dna steganographic authentication. applied dna sciences (losangeles) is actively pursuing dnabased authentication of a wide range of materials and has been the subject of recent presscoverage. application of the steganographic potential of dna (in the form of dna microdots or packets of dna transmittedthrough conventional methods) increases the potential to hide the medium of delivery while further hiding the message oridentifier within the dna itself. encryption of the basefour lexicon is a logical extension of this approach, but may not benecessary in practical application. such a

proteinbasedholograms. much of the work has focused on the use of bacteriorhodopsin, a protein produced by thesalt marsh archaebacteria halobacterium salinarium found in hightemperature brine pools. this transmembrane protein is a green, sunlightdriven proton pump that can maintain its structure and function attemperatures as high as 140c (shen et al., 1993). the native molecule is composed of three proteinchains, each of which has a molecule of retinal bound deep inside. retinal contains a string of carbonsthat strongly absorb light. when a photon is absorbed, it causes a change in the conformation of theavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.78avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesmolecule from a straight form to a bent form that powers the pumping of protons.6 the protein has beenadapted for device application because it can undergo structural changes induced by light once everyfew milliseconds for hundreds of millions of times.as stated in the nrc report opportunities in biotechnology for future army applications:bacteriorhodopsin has excellent holographic properties because of the large change in refractive indexthat occurs following light activation. it converts light into a refractive index change with approximately65% efficiency. furthermore, the protein is 10 times smaller than the wavelength of light. this meansthat the resolution of the thin film is determined by the diffraction limit of the optical geometry ratherthan the graininess of the film. bacteriorhodopsin can absorb 2 photons simultaneously and therefore canbe used to store information in 3 dimensions by using 2photon architectures (nrc, 2001).bacteriorhodopsin can also be genetically engineered to do different tasks and adapted for numerousproteinbased devices (wise et al., 2002; hillebrecht et al., 2004). mutations have been introduced thatenhance its holographic properties, and one of the most successful device applications has been in thedevelopment of holographic and volumetric threedimensional (3d) memories. in principle, an optical3d memory can store roughly three orders of magnitude more information than that on a 2d opticaldisk in the same size enclosure. these proteinbased memories have the advantage of the memorymediumõs being extremely rugged. it can withstand substantial gravitational forces and is unaffected byhighintensity electromagnetic radiation and cosmic rays. these memories are also lightweight andinsensitive to moisture. therefore, proteinbased polymer cuvettes would be a suitable memory mediumfor troops to carry with them into harsh environments.bacteriorhodopsinbased films can also be produced for use in developing patternrecognitiondevices and largescale associative memories and associative processors that would allow for the processing of intelligence and sensor data in visual formats from multiple sources in real time (nrc, 2001).one company offering bacteriorhodopsin for sale for use in òoptical data processing, optical switches,elektrochemische industrie gmbh in munich. (see chart 62.)the current problem with the use of this technology is that, to be read, such a proteinbasedhologram cube (the size of a sugar cube) requires a light source the size of a large suitcase. however, ifthe light sources and instrumentation are shrunk to the size of a personal digital assistant, the cubebecomes practical to be carried and read in the field.committee focus: challenges to battle readinesstroops must be ready to respond to threats on short notice as well as to participate in plannedmilitary actions. disease that incapacitates but does not kill (as opposed to the effects of weapons ofmass destruction) can be disabling and the source of the infection difficult to determine. particularvulnerabilities are the foodborne, vectorborne, and zoonotic diseases that could be introduced locallyand for which vaccines, good diagnostics, and treatment are not available. a number of pathogens could beenvisioned for such development. two that are particularly likely are noroviruses and avian influenza virus.the committee notes that such developments fall outside the realm of acceptable offense from theblue perspective. as observed in chapter 1, however, blue forces may well encounter red forcesthat are willing to employ capabilities that the united states would not consider.6for more information, see, for example, protein data bank, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/molecules/pdb271.html. lastaccessed on february 11, 2005.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.biotechnology trends relevant to warfare initiatives79technologyobservablesbacteriorhodopsin for holographicmessaging and development of advancedholographic technologiesthis technology is likely to come fromadvances in dvd (digital video disc)technology for movies. the most likelysource would be the commercial sector(e.g., technology companies such as applecomputer and gentec). web sites for lightshows, rock bands, pseudomilitarycompanies, and specialeffects housesshould be monitored.accessibilitymaturityconsequencelevel 2watchthreaten bluecommunications superiority.norovirusesparticularly disabling pathogens are viruses in the norovirus family. noroviruses (also callednorwalklike viruses) are spread through contaminated food or water; they cause acute vomiting,diarrhea, and fever. there are many viruses in this group, so multiple episodes of infection are common.noroviruses are extremely contagious because of their low infectious dose (<100 viral particles), prolonged asymptomatic shedding (up to 2 weeks after recovery), ability to resist chlorination, and stabilityin the environment. norovirus outbreaks are common in military deployments and were the mostcommon cause of disability among soldiers in operations desert storm and desert shield (mccarthy etal., 2000). a 2002 outbreak among british soldiers and hospital staff in afghanistan resulted in closureof the field hospital. eleven people with severe symptoms were evacuated to germany and england,partly because of the inability to diagnose the disease (mmwr, 2002).currently, this group of viruses cannot be cultured, so the ability of individuals to purposefullyintroduce infection through contamination of the food or water supply is limited (the only source ofvirus is stool of an infected person). however, this is an area of intense investigation, and the recentreport of the culture of a mouse norovirus may lead the way to the culture of human noroviruses (wobuset al., 2004). if cultured organisms were available, strains for which immunity is uncommon or does notexist could be chosen for introduction at strategic times and places. the dna copy of the virus couldthen be used to produce specifically altered forms of the virus that could be designed to evade immunity,to have increased virulence, or to deliver genes encoding toxins or other virulence factors. (see chart 63.)avian influenzaanother pathogen of concern is the family of avian influenza virusesñboth h5n1 and h7n2 havecaused severe human illness. influenza virus is spread by the respiratory route, so an introduction ofinfection into a military population might be more difficult than with a foodborne or waterborne virus.however, it could be introduced through infection of local animals such as pigs or chickens. lack ofimmunity in the human population would ensure widespread disease. the major current barrier to theuse of this virus to disable military populations is the lack of humantohuman transmission of currentstrains.

(see chart 65.)summarybiotechnology capabilities are rapidly expanding and becoming more and more readily available toscientists throughout the world. emerging biotechnologies in functional brain imaging, communications, the spread of disabling infections, and sensor spoofing are likely to affect the conduct of militaryoperations and the status of national security in the future. these biotechnologies have been highlightedin this chapter.the neuroimaging techniques of eeg, meg, fmri, and nirs provide direct measurement of brainfunction. technology underlying these modalities is advancing rapidly to allow a multitude of measurements. these technologies may provide a better understanding of behavior, performance, readiness, andstress that is relevant to understanding the cultural differences in motivation and prisoner interrogation.there are many opportunities on the horizon for biology to play a role in communications. theseinclude protein cube holography and bacteriorhodopsin solidstate devices for storing highdensityinformation, and dna sequences as a medium for hiding covert messages.dna is currently available, capable of storing and communicating large amounts of hidden information, in a compact and stable medium as dna itself or in the signaltonoise ratio of sequence data.work on bacteriorhodopsin has been ongoing for a substantial period, and genetic manipulation of thisremarkable molecule continues to open new opportunities for its use. one of these uses is holography,but there are also other technologies that are maturing for embedding messages in holograms. thetechnology for reading holograms is the current limiting factor in exercising this potential.technologyobservablesdevelopment and distribution of organisms as decoysone

recommendationsthis report identifies some of the major challenges confronting the intelligence technology warningcommunity but makes no attempt to prioritize specific emerging technologies for more detailed analysis.instead, the committee describes broad trends, discusses a prototype methodology that may be of valuein focusing future collaborations, and òemploysó that methodology on a disparate set of evolvingtechnologies that may threaten u.s. military preeminence.collaboration with external scientific and technical communitiesthe committee postulated in chapter 1 and illustrated in chapters 3 through 6 that the informationtechnology, biotechnology, microtechnology, and nanotechnology families will increasingly providebuilding blocks of a foundational nature for militaryrelevant capabilities for red (adversarial) andblue (u.s. military) forces alike. the fact that significant advances in these technologies will bedriven largely by commercial demandñon a global scaleñrather than by militaryspecific investmentsuggests the need for the technology warning community to engage the nongovernmental scientific andtechnical community in order to bolster its understanding and anticipation of technology trends.finding 1: there is a multitude of evolving technologies for which advances are being driven by thenongovernmental, global, scientific and technical communities.while globalization has been underway for several decades, its intensity and pervasiveness havegreatly increased in magnitude and pace; the technology playing field is accordingly undergoing massivechange. technology research and development (r&d), historically dominated by the united states, isincreasingly distributed. small, researchseeded startup companies are of special importance in thegeneration of hightechnology ideas and products. what this means is that the u.s. defense establishment is no longer in the driverõs seat with regard to militarily relevant technological innovation.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.84avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesrecommendation 1: the defense intelligence agency technology warning division, togetherwith the related intelligence community components that focus on technology warning, shouldestablish an ongoing collaborative relationship with the scientific and technical communities in theindustrial and academic sectors.the national academies, through the national research council, provide both a window into thesecommunities and an appropriate institutional mechanism that could assist in this endeavor. this ad hoccommittee, which will be disbanded with the publication of the present report, believes that a standingcommittee could more effectively support the needs of the defense intelligence agency (dia). theshortterm effort of this committee was hampered by the lack of time to build a shared understanding ofthe technology warning divisionõs operating environment and to establish the collaborations necessaryto adequately leverage the additional expertise readily accessible via the national academies throughthe national research council. the establishment of a standing committee would help overcome theseimpediments and provide the foundation for an ongoing collaborative relationship.indicators relating to globalization and commercializationthe forces of globalization and commercialization that are altering the world in terms of thepotential for òtechnology surpriseó require new approaches to the identification of indicators forproviding technology warning. throughout this report the committee focused largely on observablesderived from open sources, but other potentially valuable sources exist (e.g., confidential discussionswith industrial and academic researchers that may yield valuable insights for the technology warningcommunity while protecting proprietary information). although a diverse array of potential sources isidentified in the preceding chapters, the individual sources were not vetted and the committee did notconduct a disciplined evaluation of the completeness of the array, nor did it make any effort to deconflictits sources with those already in use by the community.finding 2: new intelligence indicators are likely to be needed to provide technology warning forthe diverse spectrum of evolving technologies that are being driven by commercial forces in theglobal marketplace.traditionally, the united states has assumed that it leads the world in science and technology. thisperspective leads the technology warning community to look for indications that external actors aretrying to òcatch up,ó or to exploit known technologies in new ways. projected future trends suggest thatit should no longer be automatically assumed that the united states will lead in all relevant technologies.this revised perspective imposes a new burden on the technology warning community, generating theneed for it to search in different places and in different ways to be able to warn against technologicalsurprise.recommendation 2: the defense intelligence agency technology warning division, in collaboration with the related intelligence community components that focus on technology warning,should establish, maintain, and systematically analyze a comprehensive array of indicators pertainingto globalization and commercialization of science and technology to complement and focus intelligence collection and analysis.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.findings and recommendations85the committee believes that the observables identified in this report provide a useful baseline.however, it acknowledges that the first step should be to decompose the broad trends into potentialobservables more systematically and then to evaluate the utility and applicability of techniques alreadyin use in open source intelligence analysis. for example, while patterns and trends in r&d investmentsprovide useful indicators of the distributed research talent, the globalization of manufacturing facilitiesmay indicate an equally important trend in distributing systems integration expertise. the committeeacknowledges that not all important technological advances will occur in this arena, so longstandingapproaches to detecting covert advances will continue to be important. however, the committee believesthat trends in the global technology marketplace warrant focused strategies.need for disciplined methodologyas previously observed, the technology warning landscape is both diverse and complexñparticularly given the need to consider not only discrete technologies but also innovative integration andapplication to multidisciplinary system capabilities. the committee believes that a systematic approachis needed to avoid the trap of simply generating more lists of technologies that will have militarysignificance in the coming years. the committee recognizes, however, that too much rigor couldeffectively create a new set of blinders that could lead to future òfailures of imagination.ófinding 3: the landscape of potentially important evolving technologies is both vast and diverse. adisciplined approach is thus needed to facilitate optimal allocation of the limited resources availableto the technology warning community.the committee reviewed a diverse array of lists of technologiesñeach prioritized from a differentperspective. some lists focus on potential òdisruptiveó technologies that could have catastrophic consequences in the hands of adversaries, while others focus on technologies with significant commercialpotential that may erode the u.s. technological edge. the committee believes that the technologywarning community would benefit from a disciplined approach to the identification and prioritization ofthe evolving technologies that may threaten u.s. military preeminence.recommendation 3: the defense intelligence agency technology warning division, in collaboration with the related intelligence community components that focus on technology warning,should adopt a capabilitiesbased framework within which to identify and assess potential technologybased threats.the committee believes that a capabilitiesbased methodology enables a systematic approach totechnology warning while reducing the tendency to focus only on advances in discrete technologies. themethodology presented as a prototype in this report was derived from joint vision 2020. it is offered asa starting point; the committee acknowledges that additional refinement is needed.conclusionthe technology warning community, which plays a vital role in advising military leadership, isfacing unprecedented challenges. blue force strategies are increasingly dependent upon technologyavoiding surprise in an era of global technology

arranged here in alphabetical order, are quoted from a 2001 study sponsored bythe central intelligence agency (oti ia, 2001). in that study, a panel of experts identified three tiers oftechnologies (see box 11 in chapter 1) likely to impact national security by the 2015 time frame.advanced materials: development of materials, generated at the micro level, that are the buildingblocks for stronger, more efficient physical structures of all sizes. these materials are not inherentlymechanical systems (such as mems) but are building blocks that can be combined to produce physicalsystems of greatly increased physical strength or other highly desirable attributes (e.g., electricalconductivity).alternative energy: development of energy from a source that can be replenished or that replenishesitself, such as solar and wind energy, and is generally environmentally less harmful than ôtraditionalõenergy sources. this excludes fuel cells and nuclear power. electrical energyñonce generatedñmay beused in a variety of applications including transportation, manufacturing, or energy weapons applications.brainmachine interfaces: development of computers with wideranging interfaces that will ultimatelyinclude pointing, gesturing, and other forms of communication, allowing substantive humancomputerinteractions without the need for physical contact. this will require complex integration of speechrecognition, naturallanguage processing, speech analysis, knowledgebased reasoning ability, and speechgeneration.cloned or tailored organisms: organisms that are genetically modified to produce repeatable characteristics. these may be animals or plants used as source material for medical purposes or food sources.productivity associated with plant and livestock production is significantly increased in these products.directed energy (microwave): development of highpower directed energy systems (excluding lasers)that allow for the coherent (no diffusion) transmission of energy (at the òmegawattó level) in the radioavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.100avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesfrequency (rf) spectrum. these may be used as weapons or as alternate (nonwirebased) methods ofenergy transmission, including transmission of energy to and from space.distributed energy: development of smallscale, efficient, stationary, energygeneration technologiesthat use a variety of fuels and technologies (natural gas, solar energy, and fuel cells). these generationsystems are distributed in homes, businesses, and workplaces such that existing large conventionalpower generation systems are secondary. the resulting energy grid has much higher levels of reliabilityand efficiencies because of fewer transmission losses.distributedgridbased processing systems: a type of computing in which different components andobjects comprising an application can be located on different computers connected to a network. itrequires a set of standards that specify how objects communicate with each other. distributed computational systems, in combination with multiagent software, can achieve extremely high processing levels.efficient software development: development of significant enhancements in algorithm designs anddevelopment, testing, and production of software such that the human labor and time required fordeveloping complex code are greatly reduced and a much more efficient use is made of computerprocessing capability.fuel cells: development of efficient, safe, costeffective hydrogen, natural gas, or other, not yet identified, fuel cells. these devices would produce electricity through chemical processes. fuel cells are inlimited use today in a variety of applications, such as automobiles.gene therapy: the treatment of disease by either replacing damaged or abnormal genes with normalones or providing new genetic instructions to help fight diseases such as cancer.highpower lasers: development of highpower directed energy lasers that allow for the coherent (nodiffusion) transmission of energy (at the òmegawattó level) in the òlaseró portions (infrared [ir], nearir, visual) of the rf spectrum. these may be used as weapons or as alternate (nonwirebased) methodsof energy transmission, including transmission of energy to and from space.hypersonic/supersonic aircraft: development of propulsion, fuels, and materials to allow for sustainedroutine military hypersonic and/or commercial supersonic flight. this would allow transcontinentalmovement of personnel, weapons, and equipment in far less time.image understanding: this consists of automatic target recognition and machine vision. it involvesachieving rapid and accurate pattern recognition of shapes using machineprocessed sensor data, thenusing the recognized pattern to identify and track objects. such systems provide high reliability formachine (weapon) recognition of shapes and objects and enable the military to identify, assess, and tracktargets.microelectromechanical systems (mems): mems technology is the integration of mechanicalelements, sensors, actuators, and electronics on a silicon substrate. current applications include ink jetprinter heads, sensitive pressure and mass sensors, accelerometers for airbag deployment, and memsbased moving mirrors as switches to fiberoptic telecommunications networks. future devicescould be based on polymers, with their raw materials far less expensive and less equipment intensive formanufacturing than current materials. the most promising area for application of polymer mems is inbiomedicine.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix c101molecular electronics (or òmoletronicsó): electronic transport through individual molecules. speculative applications include lowpower logic in circuits, simplified highspeed memory, and cellularautomata and neuromolecular networks in computers or other information technology devices.multilingual voice recognition: development of computer systems that can recognize spoken wordsin various languages. such systems can be distributed so that language no longer becomes a barrier inhuman interactions.nanotechnology: the ability to measure, manipulate, and organize matter on a nanoscaleñ1 billionthto 100 billionths of a meter. this will lead to dramatic changes in the way materials, devices, andsystems are understood and create major developments in areas such as computer efficiency, humanorgan restoration, and òdesigneró materials.newgeneration nuclear power plants: development of safe, environmentally improved, and costcompetitive electrical power generation from nuclear processes (fission and possibly fusion).nextgeneration space shuttle system: development of propulsion, fuels, and materials for routinesustained military and/or commercial travel into space. this may be a fully reusable twostagetoorbitvehicle with concordelike flight operations.optical communications: development and use of optical signal generation, amplification, switching,and transmission of communications data. a complete òoptical pipeó enhances the efficiency (speed andvolume) of communications streams.performanceenhancing drugs: development of mental and physical performanceenhancing drugssuch that human physical or cognitive ability is increased in a clearly measurable way (more than10percent) across the entire age spectrum.regenerative medicine (including tissue engineering): development of procedures to grow human andanimal organs, skin, and cartilage for healthcare purposes and for the production of food, clothing, andmany other products. includes development and manipulation of laboratorygrown molecules, cells,tissues, or organs to replace or support the function of defective or injured body parts.sensor webs: development of complex arrays and networks of sensors that could be used both in spacefor strategic needs and at the lowest echelons for urban warfare. one example would be the deploymentof a large constellation of synthetic aperture radar imaging satellites to provide nearly realtime worldwide coverage. all information from sensors is relayed to a central uplink, where information is uploadedinto a computer and analyzed.òsmartó materials (organic and inorganic): development of materials that have internal sensing andadjustment mechanisms such that they can repair themselves if damaged or if structural integrity isthreatened or reduced. organic materials for control of biological systems (sewage treatment and photosynthesis) have selfcontained feedback mechanisms to respond to changes in the environment so theoverall process is sustained or improved.ubiquitous water generation: development of economical, clean, safe, potable water. this water hasbeen through the flocculation, filtration, disinfection (via chlorine or ozone), and fluoridation processes.the technology includes developments in desalinization; such techniques may or may not depend ondevelopment of new energy sources.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.102avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advanceswireless communications: a control system or communications system in which electromagnetic oracoustic waves transmit a flow of data or a signal through air or space instead of through wire or cable.in most cases, rf or ir signals are used. typical wireless equipment used today are wireless local areanetworks, global positioning systems, cellular telephones, personal pagers, cordless computer

3communicationsmodern communications networks are composed of many links: satellite communication channelsprovide highbandwidth pathways within and between continents, cable and fiber channels providesecure highbandwidth channels over long distances, and radio links of various kinds serve to connectpersonnel and equipment over short, medium, and long ranges. each type of link has its own advantagesand disadvantages and is vulnerable to different forms of exploitation and attack. a variety of reportspublished by the national research council (nrc) and others discuss these and related topics (nrc,1991, 1996a,b, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002).communications networks using the internet protocol (ip) stack form the basis of networkcentricwarfare. while ip networks can operate using a heterogeneous set of techniques for moving the data, theprotocols are common to all technologies and present a common set of vulnerabilities that might beexploited by an adversary. attacks on the protocols themselves, or attacks on the environment based onassumptions made by the protocols, leave them vulnerable to disruption. attacks on the protocols arewell known and have been described in the literature on networking, as have attacks based on the waythe protocols operate (e.g., denialofservice attacks).the ability to secure communication channels with encryption is clearly a crucial capability. withoutthis protection red forces would be able to intercept or exploit information relayed between variousdivisions of the armed forces, much as the allied forces were able to intercept axis radio transmissionsduring world war ii. it is already the case that certain types of encryption technology are subject tostringent export controls under existing laws. however, much of the basic knowledge about cryptographic schemes is commonly available in the public domain. cryptographic research has been describedin the open literature along with the revolution in computing technology that has enabled it.the newest encryption standard, rijndael, or the advanced encryption standard (aes; fips197)replaces the data encryption standard (des) that is now regarded as vulnerable (nist, 2000). it isimportant to note that the government did not develop the data encryption algorithm that will be used formost data. the technical skills required to implement secure communication schemes are taught inavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.104avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesundergraduate computer science courses and so are available in many parts of the world. this impliesthat opposing forces could readily encrypt their own transmissions if they chose to do so. such encryption can also be expected to be very strong, and difficult or impossible to break using known methods.programs such as pretty good privacy (pgp) and gnu privacy guard (gnupg), which can be obtainedover the internet by anyone, provide essentially unbreakable security if used properly.computationcomputational systems are used to process the data gathered by sensor systems and human agentsand to produce information that can be used by decision makers in command centers and on the field. asthe armed forces become increasingly networked and more data become available online, blue forceswill rely increasingly on computational systems to sift through the available information to providesituational awareness and to identify patterns. computational systems are also used to automate difficultor tedious decision processes. logistic operations, for example, can be optimized through the use ofautomated planning and scheduling systems.the economies of scale and competitive pressures in the commercial computer sector have produceda situation where processing power has become a commodity. powerful 32 and 64bit microprocessorsare produced at low cost both domestically and internationally. one result of this trend is that it hasbecome much simpler for other nations to acquire stateoftheart computational capabilities. considerthe fact that the majority of the supercomputers in the top 500 listing are composed of collections ofstandard microprocessors lashed together with highperformance networks.it will always be the case that the most demanding computational applications such as imageinterpretation, automated language translation, data mining, and so on will fuel the drive for everincreasing processing power. however, the skills and components required to construct powerfulcomputational clusters are now widely available internationally.it is not only access to highperformance computing that is a concern. increasingly, lowpowerelectronics is an area of active research and development that will be especially important in the area ofsensor networks. to provide increased intelligence at the sensor and to reduce the demands on thenetwork, a significant amount of processing will have to occur at the sensor; such processing power isenabled by lowpower electronics.as the price of computing hardware has dropped, the relative importance of software has increased.at this point, some of the most significant technical challenges in implementing the vision of the futurecombat systems program center on the issue of developing reliable software systems that can coordinate distributed networks of sensors, actuators, and computers into a seamless whole. this task iscomplicated by the fact that the systems are expected to work in a dynamic environment in whichelements may be added or removed unexpectedly and communications are not assured. in this regard,research and development being carried out in distributed systems, grid computing, and sensor networksshould be viewed as germane to the military context.the ability to produce and maintain sophisticated software systems relies on the availability ofskilled personnel, programmers, analysts, testers, and others. here again, it is the case that humanresources are available internationally. china, for example, currently graduates five times more engineersthan does the united states. the indian city of bangalore now has more technology jobs than siliconvalley. in the face of current worldwide trends, it is unlikely that blue forces will have a significantadvantage in terms of their ability to design, deploy, and operate the computational infrastructurerequired to support information collection and exploitation. the number of trained software engineers isdeclining in the united states but is increasing rapidly in countries in asia.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix d105sensing and sensorsinformation dominance hinges on the ability to collect tactically relevant information in a timelymanner. this information can be derived from a variety of sources. standoff sensors mounted onsatellite platforms or aircraft provide a relatively noninvasive means of assessing the tactical situation inremote locations. a variety of sensors have been successfully deployed on these platforms, ranging frompassive imaging sensors that can collect measurements in a range of spectral bands to active sensors thatcan be used to identify camouflaged vehicles or to produce accurate elevation maps of remote sites. as usefulas these standoff sensors are, they can be confounded by bad weather, limited resolution, and camouflage.radar systems are also an important component of situational awareness and are commonly used toidentify and localize aircraft and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the airspace in the theaterof operations. synthetic aperture radar (sar), for example, has proved useful in a variety of applications.on the battlefield, useful information can be derived from a variety of sensors, including chemicalsensors, cameras, thermal sensors, and acoustic sensors. it is becoming increasingly attractive to considerdeploying collections of small, lowpower computational elements equipped with sensors and wirelesscommunication systems that could provide information about a given area of interest. a compellingexample is the recent development of acoustic sensor arrays for the detection and localization of sourcesof gunfire. also beginning to become available are inexpensive biological sensors. the development ofdna microarray chips, for example, promises to provide inexpensive, rapid identification of biologicalsamples.a large, redundant multiplicity of sensors is typically deployed to ensure the information dominanceon which u.s. forces are now heavily reliantñranging from spacebased sensors to those deployed onunmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) to smart dust. it is often the case that sensor systems will be deployedin conjunction with communication systems that are used to correlate information obtained in variouslocations or to transmit sensor information to decision makers in command centers or on the field.relevant information can also be derived from radio systems that can be used to intercept transmissionsor to pinpoint the location of transmission stations, radar installations, or jammers.remote sensingremote sensing is watching and listening to the actions of the enemy from a distance. examplesinclude radar (watching using electromagnetic waves) and sonar (listening using acoustic waves) andcan be further divided into active and passive categories as discussed below. the basic functionality isto stand off from the action and monitor the battlespace or the environment for telltale signs of enemyactivity. sensors operate in the range from ultraviolet (uv) to radio frequency (rf) as elucidated below.¥active sensing involves sending out a probe and monitoring a response. the classic example ofactive sensing is radarña pulse is transmitted and various modalities of scattered or reflectedenergy are monitored. the information return can be very rich, as in the case of spectroscopicprobing of, for example, molecular species in the infrared (ir) or biological species with a uvexcitation. in optimal circumstances, active sensing provides enhanced sensitivity and/or rangecompared with passive techniques. the disadvantage, of course, is that the enemy can also see theassociated emissions and can, in the worst case, direct fire to destroy the sensing capabilityñandpossibly its operators.¥passive sensing relies on detection of natural emissions, such as thermal emissions, muzzleflashes, rocket or airplane exhaust, and so on. passive sensing is more likely to be covert; thereavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy

that the signals are weaker and usually exhibit lower specificity and/or discrimination than that achieved with active sensing. it may be possible to opportunistically take betteradvantage of ambient signals already available in the environment, such as those from televisionand radio stations that radiate at high power and at known frequencies. with more sophisticatedsignalprocessing techniques, it may be possible to use these sources in much the same way thatactive sensing would be used.sensor systemssynthetic aperture radarsynthetic aperture radar (sar) is an electronic imaging technology that was introduced in the early1950s. its invention is generally credited to carl wiley, a u.s. engineer who was then working at thegoodyear facility in arizona. sar involves the collection of a set of microwave pulses transmitted andreceived, from reflection off earthõs surface, from an aircraft or a spacecraft as it moves along a flightpath. this collection of received radar echoes forms a phasehistory data set, which can be processed bya digital computer into an image of the portion of the ground that is illuminated by the craftõs radarantenna beam. sar filled at least two gaps that were inherent in the capabilities of conventional opticalimagers: namely, operation at night and operation in allweather conditions. with the advent of this typeof radar imaging, the various vehicles on a battlefield (at least the stationary ones) could be located byan aircraft carrying a sar at any time of day or night, and even in the presence of clouds, smoke,ordust.the most significant limitation of the first sar imagers was that of relatively poor spatial resolution. early sars achieved only several meters of resolution, which could allow an image analyst todelineate large features on earthõs surface but would not, for example, allow one to distinguish a tankfrom an ambulance on the battlefield. fifty years later, stateoftheart sars typically produce imagerywith spatial resolution at a level of several inches, so that vehicle identification is now feasible. severalkey developments during the past 20 years have led to this ability of sars to achieve such a high levelof spatial resolution. these include (1) highaccuracy electronic navigation systems, including theadvent of the global positioning system (gps), that allow an aircraftõs threedimensional position to beknown to a relative accuracy on the order of a wavelength (typically centimeters) across a flight path(synthetic aperture) that may be kilometers long; (2) electronics that allow signals of ultrahigh bandwidth (several gigahertz) to be synthesized and processed; (3) highspeed digital computing electronicsthat allow large amounts of raw radar pulse data to be formed via signalprocessing techniques intodigital images in real time or nearreal time; and (4) the invention of a robust autofocus algorithm, whichis a postprocessing methodology that can remove the blurring artifacts in the formed sar image thatresult from the small residual position errors left by the electronic navigation system.circa 1980, researchers in the sar arena discovered that another aspect of sar made it capable ofperforming certain tasks that were not achievable with optical or ir sensors. this discovery wasfounded in the fact that sars are coherent imaging systems, whereas conventional electrooptical andinfrared systems are not. as a coherent imager, a sar transduces not only the amount of microwaveenergy reflected from earthõs surface, but also the phase of the reflected energy at any given position inthe image. the quantity òphaseó encodes, among other things, information regarding the precise position of a radar reflector, e.g., a rock, a piece of dirt, or a blade of grass, that lies within one of theresolution cells (pixels) of the formed sar image. as a result, any change in the position of a reflectoravoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix d107can be measured to within a fraction of a wavelength (e.g., several millimeters) by computing the phasedifference as measured by a pair of sar images taken of the same scene on earthõs surface, butseparated in time, typically by hours to days. known as coherent change detection (ccd), this procedure has been a very effective tool for more than a decade now in detecting subtle surface changes,including vehicle tracks and even human footprints. a second related phase difference technique knownas interferometric sar terrain mapping (ifsar), can produce digital terrain elevation maps of earthõssurface that are accurate to within inches of elevation when measured on post spacings as small as1meter.current research in sar involves attempts to have a computer automatically identify the vehiculartargets within a formed sar image. this set of techniques is commonly known as sar automatic targetrecognition (atr). in addition, serious research and development efforts are aimed at imaging andidentifying moving vehicular targets, a capability generally referred to as movingtarget indicators(mtis). finally, interest continues in sars that can penetrate foliage (fopen sar) and sars whoseradar transmitter and receiver are not collocated; that is, they are on different platforms (bistatic sar).sars will undoubtedly continue to be adapted to meet larger and larger shares of the imaging needs ofboth military and civilian efforts (jakowatz et al., 1996).1orbital sensorsorbital sensors are an important part of the u.s. arsenal. assets range from lowearthorbit togeosynchronous sensing systems, with most of the sensing complement in the lowearthorbit category.a wide variety of primarily electromagnetic sensorsñfrom the infrared to the ultravioletñare deployed,and the u.s. military is highly dependent on their capabilities. increasingly, commercial enterprises areproviding similar capabilities, at least in the visible wavelength range, and anyone can now anonymouslyorder a satellite photograph of his or herñor yourñneighborhood at very modest cost. here as elsewhere, it will be important to continuously assess a potential enemyõs access and sophistication and notassume that the military capabilities are far superior, as they have been for so long. because of thecommercial uses, access to space resources is no longer a state monopoly.it is also important to consider what kinds of images an adversary might buy on the commercialmarketñfor a modest price, for example, submeterresolution images can be purchased over theinternetñand what their value might be for a subpeer state or even a nonstate actor such as a terroristorganization. highresolution imagery as the domain of only peer adversaries is now a thing of the past,and the impact of this change should be carefully evaluated.uxvmounted sensorsas unmanned vehicles have become more capable and affordable, reliance on them for sensing hasincreased. the obvious advantage is that no human is in harmõs way and the uavs, because they aresmall, fast, maneuverable, and lowobservable, provide a major advantage. this capability puts apremium on small, lowpowerconsumption sensor technologies. just as in the case of satellitebasedsensing systems, these sensors have taken good advantage of the continuing shrinkage of integratedcircuit size, power consumption, and weight, as well as advances in micro and nanotechnologies thatare increasingly putting more power into smaller systems. a clear issue for the long term is that the1personal communication from charles jakowatz, sandia national laboratories, to the committee, january 26, 2005.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national

andeurope are devoting significant resources to research in robotics and in micro and nanotechnologies.2geolocation sensor systemsglobal positioning system. one form of sensing that has become increasingly important is geolocation.the advent of the global positioning system (gps) has made it possible to accurately register thepositions of equipment and personnel to tactical imagery or available maps. this capability makes iteasier to guide blue forces in complex and fluid tactical situations. as reliance on this technologygrows, however, the potential for disruption through gps jamming becomes an increasingly worrisomepossibility.in its current incarnation, the gps signals broadcast from satellites are relatively weak (eachsatellite radiates 500 watts). this means that it is possible to jam gps signals with lowpower transmitters. the low power of gps means that it is not available in urban canyons, inside buildings, or undera jungle canopy. with urban warfare becoming increasingly important, alternatives to augment thecapability provided by gps should be developed. some solutions such as gps pseudolites are possibleand could be deployed on aircraft or aerostats or even on rooftops if controlled by blue forces.another issue is that this capability is now widely available commercially. how much does this factdetract from the u.s. battlefield advantage? why have europe (france in particular) and china partneredto provide an alternative to gps? if the operators refuse to deny availability of galileo signals to anadversary, what options does the united states have?inertial navigation. microelectromechanical systems (mems)based accelerometers make possibleshortterm inertial navigation that could be used to fill the gaps in information when gps is notavailable.commercial gps navigation. commercial gpslike navigation systems, which use television signalsand are intended for urban environments, will be available in the near term. some of these systems willoffer a significant increase in bandwidth capability compared with traditional gps systems, strongersynchronization codes, and much lower operating frequencies that would allow for penetration of urbandwellings.3ultrawide band transduction. recent work on using ultrawide band (uwb) transducers for preciselocation has appeared in the open literature. the approach involves emplacement of lowpower uwbsources in, say, a building and then using timeofflight computation to determine precise location.tidal forces. there are currently many solutions to tracking objects that move at high speed, such asfixedwing aircraft, through the use of gps and/or inertial measurement units (imus). unfortunately,tracking the movement of slower objects remains a problem in situations where gps is not available.recent work has focused on the use of variations in the local gravitational field. simulations havebeen developed using closedform solutions that analyze these geophysical signals, add appropriate2see, for example, http://www.nano.gov/html/res/intstratdevroco.htm. last accessed on april 8, 2005.3see, for example,

be performed and to ascertainthe types of sensing and signalprocessing technologies required to implement a fieldable microsystem(novak et al., 2005).networked point sensorsthere is increasing interest in the emergent properties of networked point sensorsñextending fromlarge systems (e.g., satellite antenna arrays) to small expendable selfcontained microsystems or òsmartdustóñas an approach to sensing with improved performance and often with enhanced robustness.commercial products such as smartmeshtm, a lowpower wireless mesh sensor network, are already inuse.4 the vulnerabilities of these systems vary considerably, but clearly the network managementaspects are very difficult and are inherently subject to intercept, jamming, and deception strategies.since most electronics manufacturing occurs outside the continental united states, it is likely thatthe united states will face adversaries with significant sensor networking capabilities soon after thetechnologies are developed. there are no esoteric materials or techniques involved, and, once committed to silicon, the sensors can be replicated inexpensively in the millions. since software engineeringexpertise is not confined to the united states, once the algorithms are developed and published in theopen literature it can be expected that they will be implemented both in commercial products and by themilitary establishments of u.s. adversaries.sensor modalitiesterahertz sensorsthe terahertz frequency range (once called the submillimeter spectral region) has seen a recentincrease in research activity largely because of the potential ability of terahertz sensors to òsee throughwalls and under clothes.ó (such a capability raises many new issues such as those related to privacy ina law enforcement context.) the largest issue is the lack of a suitable set of sources of sufficient powerand detectors of sufficient sensitivity. at present much of this work is in the research stage and isavailable primarily to state actors. understanding of the interaction of terahertz waves with materials,for example, spectroscopy of complex biomolecules, is at a very primitive stage, with interesting andpossibly important suggestions of an enhanced capability for discrimination of signals, but withouteither a strong theoretical or an extensive experimental foundation.infrared spectrumthe infrared is a very informationrich spectral region. the rotationalvibrational spectra of allmolecular species lie in the infrared. further, the peak of roomtemperature blackbody radiation is atabout 10 micrometers in the ir so that all of these species radiatively exchange energy with theenvironment. monitoring this radiation provides a critical sensing modality. nightvision imagingsensors are sensitive over a range of nearir wavelengths and enable troops to operate in nighttime anddark environments. these detectors operate by sensing differences in temperature/emissivity from4see, for

surprise in an era of global technology advancesdifferent surfacesñwarm people and machines versus cold plants, and so on. although the advancedsensors of the u.s. military have led to the concept that òthe u.s. owns the night,ó the danger is thatthese sensors are entering the commercial sector for a variety of legitimate applications and are thusbecoming widely available to friend and foe alike. it will be important to monitor the availability ofnightvision equipment to likely adversaries, both state and nonstate, so as to avoid relying on atechnological superiority that no longer exists.visible spectrumthe visible spectrum is the range of the greatest atmospheric transmission and is also the region ofthe spectrum for which sensing equipment is the most advanced and capable. myriad sensor systemscover this range, and much work has been done in signal processing to extract information from opticalimages. as sensing equipment is increasingly silicondominated and networked processingintensive,one of the issues to be concerned with is the trustworthiness of the software and hardware, especially asthe sources of both move offshore, often to less politically reliable areas.acoustic and seismic sensorsacoustic and seismic sensors have proven useful in a variety of military applications. these sensorscan serve as simple threshold detectorsñthat is, to detect signatures that exceed specified limitsñorthey can be utilized to identify classes of targets. the acoustic signatures of military targets are fairlydiverse, and good performance in identifying them is achievable for timecritical targets. acousticarrays can provide a bearing to target. even with a limited number of sensors, properly deployed seismicarrays can provide information on direction of travel. the primary role of these sensors is as a forcemultiplier. a major challenge is efficiently and effectively analyzing the vast amounts of data generatedby even a moderate number of sensors.5,6imaging/spectroscopyincreasing use is being made of spectral imaging of a spatially resolved target. multispectral imaging and hyperspectral imaging, for example, are unquestionably powerful techniques, but they producevast quantities of data. one of the major challenges is to synthesize/compile all of the data obtained toprovide actionable information. another is to decide how much of the data to transmit over availablecommunication lines. the increasing emphasis on local dataprocessing operations to reduce the load onthe communications links can be either beneficial or harmful to the ability to maintain informationdominance, depending on the situation. the optimal system should be automatically reconfigurable inresponse to external factors that can change rapidly. this major challenge brings up all of the issues ofsurety of hardware and software and network reliability discussed above for other sensor modalities.5frederick t. mendenhall and kevin t. malone,

reserved.appendix d111chemical sensorschemical sensors can be classified as remote and point sensors. remote chemical sensors are basedlargely on spectroscopy, with transitions extending from the nearultraviolet to the terahertz region. theinfrared spectral region is the most information rich for most molecular species. for many detectionschemes, falsealarm discrimination is a major issue. the battlefield in particular is a chemicalrichenvironment, and it is important to be able to distinguish between chemical agents and other species.nerve agents, for example, are very large molecules with complex rotationalvibrational spectra withmany overlapping bonds giving a broad resonance. the phosphorusoxygen stretch at 10 micrometers isan important signature of many nerve agents. ammonia, which is commonly found in the battlefieldenvironment, is a small molecule with sharply defined rotationvibration lines. a highspectralresolution, broadly tunable sensor is needed to achieve the necessary discrimination. many point sensorsoperate by changing conductivity in the presence of chemical agents. because many things can causeconductivity to change, adequate discrimination and false alarms are major issues, and it is necessary tohave good controls and redundancy to ensure reliable readings.ionizing radiationsensing of ionizing radiation is a very mature activity, reaching back more than onehalf century.unstable nuclei go through a process via beta, alpha, positron, and electron capture or fission decay toattain a stable nucleus. the halflives for these processes differ by many orders of magnitude, as do thelevels of radiation emitted during these processes. these energy emissions generally interact withsurrounding media and therefore are attenuated as they travel from the emitting source to the detectorsystem. thus, radiation detection, although possible at large distances in some cases, is normallydescribed as point detection. often the decay particle can be measured directly, but often it is convenientto detect and quantify the gamma rays emitted during the processes. most radiation detection systemsused for search and other fieldwork rely on the detection of gamma rays and neutrons. most radionuclidescan be identified via detection of their unique gammaray signatures (knoll, 1979).the ability to identify isotopes based on gammaray spectra is greatly facilitated by using detectorswith high energy resolution to unambiguously identify the isotope by characteristic emitted energies,which show up as lines at specific energies in an energy spectrum. however, in practice there are tradeoffs. currently, and for the foreseeable future, the gammaray detectors with the best resolution are alsothe most expensive, and they exhibit other characteristics that constrain their use in many field applications.the larger and cheaper detectors exhibit poorer energy resolution. under some conditions, especiallywhere measurements can be taken for long periods of time (several minutes to hours) and/or in closeproximity (approximately a meter or less, depending on source strength and detector size), miniaturizeddetectors are required or have a niche. this is because source strength and source shielding often dictatethat less than 1 million gammas per second in 4pi geometry are available for measurement, andsometimes one to two orders of magnitude less. for small detectors with a frontal area on the order of1to 10 cm2, this means that at distances greater than 1 meter, 10 or fewer gamma rays may intersect thedetector in a second of measurement time.in many realworld applications, such as at traffic choke points or other points of entry into theunited states, measurements must be made in only a few seconds in order not to disrupt commerceunduly. thus, during such a measurement with small detectors, often the total number of gamma raysstriking the detector may be a few hundred, or less. no matter what the detector type (material), fordetectors of a reasonable thickness, the probability of interaction will be less than unity. in addition,avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.112avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancesmany gamma rays will not deposit their full energy within the detector volume, but will scatter andescape the detection volume, so that the photon energies and some other energies will have beendetected at less than the full energy peak. although these scattered gamma rays are useful, they are notspecific to the isotope being measured, but present a rather broad, featureless continuum. thus, in orderto determine the presence of a specific isotope using its specific fullenergy lines, several hundred, ormore, gamma rays must interact with the detector, in addition to those interacting based on radioactiveisotopes always present in the environment (background).the shielding and scattering effects are also energy and material dependent, making the resultingspectrum somewhat complex. thus, in many applications, larger, rather than smaller, detector volumesare required because of the physics, and there is nothing that can be done to totally overcome thislimitation through the use of different detector types or materials. in practice plastic scintillators are thelargest and cheapest of the usable gamma spectrometers. however, the energy resolution is so poor inthese lowatomicnumber organics as to make reasonable isotope identification through normal meansalmost impossibleñi.e., their use as a spectrometer is quite limited.the next general class of detectors in use is inorganic scintillators, such as nai and csi detectors.these detectors are more expensive volumewise than plastic and are usually smaller. however, theirenergy resolution and detection sensitivity are significantly better than those of plastic, and they canusually be provided with volume/area such that they are the most typical detector used for fieldedsystems providing isotope identification.another category of detector is based on a roomtemperature semiconductor, such as cadmiumzinctelluride (czt), and has an energy resolution typically three to fourfold better than that of an naidetector. this technology is still under development, and spectralgrade detectors are still difficult toobtain, are quite expensive for the volume obtained, and are variable in detection characteristics fromdetector to detector (quality control). their main drawback, however, is the small volumes obtainableñon the order of a few cubic centimeters, at best.a great deal of effort has been expended in the last decade to grow bigger, better crystals, and to useother techniques, such as combining several detector elements into arrays and providing pulseshapediscrimination, to get better resolution or larger effective sizes. but such technologies are still inadequate for most normal field applications. highpurity germanium semiconductor detectors have the bestenergy resolution available for fieldable gammaray detection. their energy resolution is better thanczt by a factor of 20 to 30 and better than nai by a factor of 50 to 100. however, they must becryogenically cooled to liquidnitrogen temperatures, thus requiring large dewars or more electricalpower for thermomechanical cooling than can typically be supplied by a batteryoperated system. inaddition, the largest sizes are about 1 liter in volumeñmuch larger than czt, but still much smaller thanthat available from nai or plastic. in addition, they are 10 times as expensive as czt and 20 to 50 timesas expensive as nai. in all cases, costs vary as a function of volume and detector quality.to overcome the limitations and difficulties associated with spectral unfolding from detectors ofpoorer energy resolution, software processing techniques have been under development. in most cases,these techniques, which can also be used with highresolution systems, make it possible to provide atleast a primary isotope detection and identification. using these techniques and detectors it is possible toseparate medical from industrial isotopes and special nuclear material and also to make some determination of the amount of shieldingñand thus to determine whether a medical isotope of reasonableactivity and little shielding, such as an isotope isolated in the human body, is being used in a legitimateapplication, or if a similar source, but orders of magnitude more intense, is being hidden within heavyshielding (one case of a radiological dispersal device). such a determination is based on the spectralavoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.appendix d113shape of the measured spectrum, a result of the energy dependence of absorption/scattering on materialspresent as described above.there are circumstances in which the effects of shielding and the requirement to determine specificisotopes of an elemental source would require the use of a highpurity germanium detector. some lowlevel emitters, such as enriched uranium, can be detected passively through other, normally associatedisotopes, such as u238 or u232. the gamma rays emitted specifically from u235 are low in energyand easily shielded, or are so weak in intensity as to be difficult to detect under most field constraints.thus, enriched uranium is often detected passively through detection and identification of gamma raysfrom associated isotopes, if present. otherwise, active interrogation methods can be employed, typicallyusing neutrons or highenergy gamma rays as the interrogating medium, that cause the u235 in thesample to fission and thus emit neutrons and other measurable gamma rays. however, such interrogatingsystems tend to be rather large and expensive and present radiation safety issues. in short, severaloptions are currently available for making radioisotopic measurements. the specific system used mustbe optimized for the specific situation and associated concept of operations. ongoing research anddevelopment aims to yield new materials and techniques, which will provide some relief in somescenarios. this development should be encouraged and funded. however, there is much that can be doneby designing appropriate systems with detectors currently available.7,8referencesjakowatz, jr., charles v. et al. 1996. spotlightmode synthetic aperture radar: a signal processing approach.

promise to provide essential additionalinformation to monitor the effectiveness of training as well as mental status. the recent advent offunctional neuroimaging, discussed below, has sparked world interest in the four major noninvasivebrainmonitoring modalities: electroencephalography (eeg), magnetoencephalography (meg), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri), and nearinfrared

blue force capability that enables training and networkedcommunication, as well as interview/interrogation. it envisions a portable modular sensor suite that is:¥noninvasive,¥expandable and flexible, and¥compatible with current systems.current methods for humanhuman tactical communication must be informed by new cognitiveresearch. in the next decade, it may be possible (with minimal

the electrical diffusion is very fast, and for all practicalpurposes the signals that appear at the scalp are simultaneous with the brain activity. the best spatialresolution is obtained for cortical primary currents. deeper subcortical primaries are detectable as wellwith a corresponding decrease in spatial resolution. when used in a functional experiment, the measuredvoltage temporal changes related to a task or stimulus are called eventrelated potentials (erps).involved in construction of an eeg is the electrode pack, which can be a personalized flexible cap,a set of signal amplifiers, a multichannel fewhundredhertz digital sampler, and an interface multiplexer, such as the nextgeneration serial bus, for presentation to a standard interpretation display,recording device, or generalpurpose onboard computer. when designed to be lightweight and compactusing even current technology, a 64channel eeg can be easily incorporated into a tankertrainingmodule, or into the actual tank, apc, bradley fighting vehicle, bcw enclosed fuchõs scout vehicle,helicopter trainer or actual cabin, and more. indeed, an eeg system can be incorporated into advancedextravehicular mobility units (emus) and integrated with the standard physiological telemetry fornominal additional weight in the new soldiersystem dismounted uniform.magnetoencephalography measures nearscalp subpicotesla magnetic field variations due to thetimedependent primary and volume currents using a cryogenic helmetmounted array of hundreds ofsuperconducting quantum interference devices (squids). meg is similar in temporal resolution toeeg. the sensor array is designed to detect currents parallel to the scalp, and meg excels in distinguishing these from currents perpendicular to the scalp (predominantly cortical surface currents in graymatter convex folds, or gyral currents).the additional weight of precision electronics and control systems necessary for meg is hard tojustify if the only benefit is realtime separation of gyral and cortical surface currents, since individualastronaut eeg meshes can be calibrated with a preflight meg such that the eeg can determine the areaof activation with acceptable accuracy. however, the higher accuracy is justifiable if some of thesquid measurement, control, and analysis systems can serve as dualpurpose apparatus for otherexperiments.the brain activity measured by eeg and meg is the result of ionic motion within the centralnervous system. ionic production, release, and movement consume energy. this energy is supplied bythe conversion of bloodborne oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin. through a complicated chainreaction called the bloodoxygenleveldependent (bold) effect, brain activity results in a net increasein the relative concentration of oxyhemoglobin in the local venous structure of the circulatory system.oxy and deoxyhemoglobin have different magnetic susceptibilities and different colors, giving rise totwo methods to measure the local hemodynamic response to brain activity.magnetic resonance imaging (mri) works by a simple excitation and relaxation of spin states.when molecules containing hydrogen are placed in a strong static magnetic field, a small but detectablenumber of hydrogen protons align their spins along the direction of the external field. an applied radiofrequency (rf) pulse near the proton resonant frequency knocks the spins perpendicular to the field, andthe relaxation back to ground state releases rf energy in a pattern that can be reconstructed to show bothavoiding surprise in an era

seriesof fast scans calibrated to optimize detection of the bold signal will show the dynamics of brainfunction under the specific internal or applied conditions; this is known as fmri, and the major advantages of this modality are threedimensional spatial resolution and complete skull penetration, making itthe only modality to unambiguously detect limbic activations important for determining certain neuropsychological states. in addition to measuring the bold signal at higher precision, future hardwareadvances will allow fine temporal monitoring of neurochemical movement and reactions using ultrafastspectroscopic analysis techniques in fmri.complete commercial clinical mri scanners weigh as much as an entire communications satelliteand are inappropriate to bolt to a military vehicle or helicopter bulkhead. what is promising, though, isthat many of the bulky or heavy components of commercial scanners are not necessary in the embodiments that will be deployed: lightweight skullcap monitors with neuralnetwork software based on thegroundheavy mri scanning systems, and the meg nearfield applied to nearinfrared spectroscopy andported into existing lowpower supplies, will be data, not weight, dependent. additionally, wholebody toroid and multiscan highresolution options are not required, but rather just a system big enoughto fit a head with a single detection coil of moderate size because highresolution scans can be collectedpremission and digitally carried along. functional mri scans are themselves moderateresolution, andany clinical diagnosis for traumatic injury to a scannable body part can be accomplished with a combination of high and moderateresolution images. finally, the cryogenic components and superconducting magnet energizer or dc electromagnet power supply can be parasitized off other necessary onboardsystems, vacuum pumps can be replaced with a good valve, and several ancillary failsafes that make thescanner clinicianproof can be eliminated. all told, an appropriate mri scanner could be put together ina couple of hundred additional pounds.nearinfrared spectroscopy, the technology behind the nascent realtime fingerclamp pulse oximeter,has developed into a commercially available 48channel boldsignalmonitoring head array mountedin a flexible cap. the system currently has moderate spatial resolution for cortical activations. futuresystems promise better resolution and deeper activation detection. figure e1 shows the neuroimagingmodalities explained above.the nirs modality can be built using available technology and dualtask postprocessing equipment. the sensory array is simply pairs of lightemitting diodes (leds) and photodiodes either directlymounted in a cap or remotely working through optical fibers. indeed, the bulk and weight of thedetection array make nirs, like eeg, an appropriate consideration for integration into advanced emusas well as vehiclemounted systems.further details of technical methodologies are available in an extended treatise (genik et al., inpress1) or complete reviews (hamalainen et al., 1993; jezzard et al., 2003). in summary, the abovemodalities are best when used in combination, and not necessarily simultaneously, as their neuroimagingstrengths complement rather than duplicate one another. eeg excels at monitoring gross mental load insteadystate conditions, though it is also adequate for determining activity in premapped corticalstructures. meg can discriminate between gyral and surface currents with moderate spatial resolution,and this can be vital information if a specific brain network structure is located in either of these places.mri is the only noninvasive modality that can specifically localize deepbrain neural systems responsible for emotional processing, essential information for determining neuropsychiatric health. finally,1genik ii, richard j., li hsieh, francis x. graydon, and christopher c. green. emergent functional brain

(2005)3 concentrates on the basics of piloting motorized vehicles whilefacing cognitive challenges, where meg was used to locate functional activity related to event detection.current work focuses on increasing the cognitive load and seeks to determine thresholds for overload,the point at which event detection breaks down and a driver or pilot can make a fatal error (failure ofhuman performance because of system interface problems and ineffective workload). the next 5 yearspromise advances in meg methodology as a complement to both eeg and fmri, although it will likelybe useful only for groundbased preflight training and screening of crewmembers. generationafternexttechnology will be required to start inflight monitoring using this modality in a regular behavioralhealth regimen.advances in understanding of brain networks involved in piloting motor vehicles and highperformance aircraft based on use of the maturing technology of bold fmri will drive functionalneuroimaging understanding of these activities in the next 5 years. previous studies have focused onnarrow aspects of navigation (uchiyama et al., 2003), attempts to localize impairment of navigationalabilities (calhoun et al., 2004), and the beginnings of nextgeneration understanding of event detectionin simulated driving tasks (graydon et al., 2004; young et al., 2005). current work is focusing onincreasing the level of distraction and monitoring the effect on detection of the primary event. it is wellknown that even heavily sedated primates show activation in the visual cortex as a result of opticalstimulation; it is also well known that humans can be looking directly at events and not react to them, abehavior known as cognitive blindness, or colloquially as the òlookbutdonotseeó phenomenon. what isnot known at all is what disruption in which brain network causes cognitive blindness, as well aswhether the risk of this phenomenon can be consistently modulated (reilly, 2003). of special relevance3young, richard a., li hsieh, francis x. graydon, richard j. genik ii, mark d. benton, christopher c. green, susan m.bowyer, john e. moran, and norman tepley. 2005. mindonthedrive: realtime functional neuroimaging of cognitive brainmechanisms underlying driver performance and distraction. presented at sae 2005 world congress and exhibition, april,detroit, mich.avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advancescopyright national academy of sciences. all rights reserved.120avoiding surprise in an era of global technology advanceshere is the identification friendorfoe problem set: friendlyfire deaths occur regularly in unmannedcombat air vehicle (ucav) and umanned aerial vehicle (uav) maneuvers, helicopter tactical operations, sniper operations, and mounted bradley and abrams operations. technology to understand andmitigate the òbrain internaló disconnect in looking but not seeing, or comprehending, or processing maybe more important statistically than a nextgeneration set of sensors that must be highly networked andcomputercentric on the distributed battlefield.the next generation of fmri multimodal studies will determine the extent to which emotionalresponses and psychopharmaceutical impairment affect navigational task learning and performance. itis expected that some optimal level of emotional involvement in navigational decisions, especially thosemade under stress from high cognitive workload, sleep deprivation, or some induced affective disorder,can be determined; for example, it is likely that optimal decision making occurs somewhere betweencoldasice detachment and òweõre all going to die!ó paranoid neuroses. such tools will be useful intraining all categories of operators, whether tankers or snipers, or to provide feedback to helicopter orucav pilots, especially those who increasingly may view simulator training as a video game. moreover, monitoring the efficiency of training and the effectiveness of alert systems can directly impact therisk of performance failure owing to interface problems and ineffective workload, as it has already beenshown that pilots show different activation levels once they become fully trained in a maneuver (pereset al., 2000), when they have reached their fastest reaction times (mohamed et al., 2004), and when analert interface is optimized to emphasize vigilance (reilly, 2003). thus, the basic groundwork is alreadyin place to òwatch soldieroperators thinkó during and after training that emphasizes attention to psychological states.generationafternext fmri imaging tools promise to deliver a capability for monitoring deepbrainemotional states inflight. research late in the next decade should also lead to simple paradigms andalgorithms capable of benchmarking behavioral fitness in a matter of minutes as part of a weekly healthregimen including examination of any neurochemistry changes in emotional reception and processingcenters.once bold fmri benchmarks are established, nirs technology can be used to monitor corticalsignals deemed important during actual task performance instead of a simulated paradigm. nirs technology can also be used to monitor bold signals from increasing cerebral recruitment during extendeddismounted activities or other longduration missioncritical assignments (drummond et al., 2004).the current operational state of the artnoncontact multispectral neurophysiological sensorsblood pressure, heart rate, interbeat interval, body tremor (0.2 to 1.0 hz), andballistocardiogramsignalprocessing algorithms (originally developed for underwater and spaceflight applications)have recently proved applicable to lowfrequency improvement in conditions with a very high signaltonoise ratio, such as for enabling realtime monitoring of numerous human neurological signals in bothaware and unaware subjects. the signals illustrate embedded cardiovascular information. such signalprocessing has been applied to the known technique of ballistocardiogram.the validation of the subsystem, sensors embedded in a chair back, legs, and seat with rf signalsòportedó to a remote station, was accomplished in a medical school: the subjects had arterial (radial)cannulation, and the software was subsequently òtrainedó by the groundtruth data.

temperature bilaterally over the cheeks and forehead were seen to beoperationally useful, and data were collected in less than 1 second (from a seated subject in a reasonablyquiet pose) that were accurate to within 0.5 degrees c.the data were compared and contrasted with breasttumor and facial thermographic units beingused clinically. the prestroke detection data were incorporated successfully into an adult male prestroke healthmonitoring program and deployed for further operational testing and evaluation in ascenario identical to that in an interview/interrogation facility (e.g., used in operational settings). thesystems were installed behind infraredtransparent, visually opaque mirrors. the rooms were constructedwith low ambient temperatures (<65 degrees f) and fans to enhance the
